Oh, boy, we love Nevada. We love Nevada. Thank you. Thank you. This is a great place. [Crowd cheering "Trump"] Thank you. Thank you very much. Great evening. We will be celebrating for a long time tonight. Have a good time. Have a good time. You know, we weren't expecting, a couple of months ago, we weren't expected to win this one.
You know that, right? We were, of course, if you listen to the pundits we weren't expected to win too much. Now we're winning, winning, winning the country, and soon the country is going to start winning, winning, winning. So I want to thank the volunteers, they've been unable. These people they worked like endlessly, endlessly.
We're not going to forget it. And we've had some great numbers coming out of Texas. And amazing numbers coming out of Tennessee and Georgia, and Arkansas. And then in a couple of weeks later Florida. We love Florida so. We're going to do very well in Ohio where a beating the governor, it's good. It's always nice to be beating the governor.
And Michigan -- the whole thing. I mean, it's going to be an amazing two months. We might not even need the two months, folks, to be honest. All right. So tonight we had 45 46%. And tomorrow you'll be hearing -- You know if they could just take the other candidates and add them up and if you could add them up because you know the other candidates amount to 55%. So if they could just add.
They keep forgetting that when people drop out we're going to get a lot of votes. [Crowd cheering] Remember. They keep forgetting. They don't say it. So I want to begin by thanking my boys. Eric has been all over the place making speeches, he's getting better than me so I'm a little jealous. And Don went up to Elko and you were all over, right?
And he loves the rifle stuff. This is serious rifle. This is serious NRA. Both of them. So -- both of them. We Love the Second Amendment, folks. Nobody loves it more than us. So just remember that. And Corey and Hope, the staff, the whole group and Charles, and Dan, and what a group we have, it's just amazing.
I want to just thank a couple of friends of mine that are here. The owner of this incredible hotel, Mr. and Mrs. Phil Ruffin, stand up. Great guy. Phil said, Donald, like for the last three months he's driving me crazy. He said, "Donald, I want to put $10 million into your campaign." I said, "Phil, I don't want your money I don't want to do it. I'm self funding." Every time I see him it's hard for me to turn down money because that's not what I've done in my whole life.
I grab it, grab it, grab. You know, I get greedy. I want money, money. Now I'm getting -- What -- I'll tell you what we're going to do, right. We get greedy, right? Now we're gonna get greedy for the United States. We're going to grab and grab, and grab. We're going to bring in so much money and so much everything, we're going to make America great again, folks.
I'm telling you. We're going to make America great again. And another great friend of mine somebody respected by everybody a great friend of Phil too, Mr. and Mrs. Steve Wynn. Stand up, Steve. Stand up. Two great people. Steve is always calling. He's always got advice. Right, Steve? "Donald I think you're do this and that." his advice I like to listen to, I'll be honest with you.
So Phil and Steve, and families, we appreciate it. You've been great friends. Thank you. Thank you. So this was very exciting tonight. But I'll tell you, it looks like we won by a lot Evangelicals. I love the evangelicals. And I have to tell you, Pastor Jeffress has been so incredible on television and elsewhere, he has been great.
And as you know, Liberty University, do we love Liberty University? [Crowd cheering] Jerry Falwell Jr., an unbelievable guy. And he has been with us and with us from the beginning. And I want to thank Jerry and his family, it's been amazing, the relationship. So we won the evangelicals we won with young.
We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated. We're the smartest people with the most loyal people. And you know what I really am happy about because I've been saying it for a long time. Forty six percent with the Hispanics, 46%, NO. 1 with Hispanics.
I'm really happy about that. So [Crowd cheering "Trump]thank you. So I'm very proud of you. This is an amazing night. And you know I love the country. I love the country. [Man shouted [We love you Trump] We're going -- we're going in the wrong direction. We're going to keep, as you know, get by we're keeping that open.
And we're going to load it up with bad dudes. We're going to load it up with a lot of bad dudes out there. We're going to have our borders nice and strong. We're going to build the wall, you know that. We're going to build the wall. And I have a lot of respect for Mexico and you just heard, we won Hispanics.
But let me tell, you Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Right? [Crowd cheering] Going to happen, going to happen. They know it. I know it. We all know it. We have a tremendous deficit. We have a trade deficit with Mexico. They'll pay for the well, they'll be very happy about it. Believe me. I'll talk to them.
