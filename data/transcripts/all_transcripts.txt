Oh, that is something. That's a lot of people. That's a lot of people. Well, one thing we know: we get the biggest crowds, by far. There's no -- if crowds mean anything, we're going to have a great Tuesday, that's for sure. Hello, Montana. I said I was coming back, and I'm back. You know, good -- back for a lot of good reasons, but two good reasons in particular -- we'll get into that.
But I am thrilled to be with you in this great state. I love this state, and you like me, based on those numbers. Those were wonderful numbers. 2016, we had one of the all-time exciting days ever. It was something -- greatest movement, greatest political movement in our history. Thank you, and I want to thank Montana.
Believe me, you were a big part of it -- big part of it. Big, big part. In just three days, the people of Montana are going to send a great man, Matt Rosendale... to the United States Senate to protect your jobs, defend your borders, and continue with what we're doing, and we're getting there fast. Make America great again, right?
See all those hats? All those hats. Look at those hats. This is one of the most important elections of our entire lives. This election will decide whether we build on the extraordinary prosperity that we've achieved, or whether we let the radical Democrats take control of Congress, and take a giant wrecking ball... to our economy, and to the future of our nation.
America now has the best economy in the history of our country. Can you believe this? Right? I said it was going to happen; I just didn't know it was going to happen this fast. It's happened fast. You saw those numbers yesterday. In the last month alone, we added another 250,000 jobs, and nearly a half a million Americans -- it's now going to be almost 600,000 Americans returned to the workforce.
Since Election Day, we've created 4.5 million new jobs. Think of that. If I ever said that during the campaign, they would not have allowed that to happen. They would have cut it. You know the way they cut the good stuff. They cut all the good stuff out. They would have cut that out. The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in more than 50 years.
More Americans are working today than ever before, nearly 157 million Americans now have jobs. We've never been there before, not even very close. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment has reached the lowest levels in the history of our country. That's not a bad sound bite. Is that a good sound bite?
OK. How do you lose the debate? Let's say we're debating the radical, liberal Democrat over here, and they go, "Oh, they're going to help jobs." I say, "Well, we had the highest jobs, the best jobs, the best employment number ever, the best unemployment numbers ever." What do they say? How do they counteract that?
They'll figure something. They'll figure something. They'll think of something like Russia. "Let's see, Russia. Let's blame Russia. We won't say that she was a lousy candidate, and we won't say, certainly, that he was a very good candidate. We would never say that." Veterans' unemployment recently hit its lowest rate in nearly 20 years.
Wages, wages, beautiful wages for the first time in years, wages are rising. Confidence is soaring. You saw the confidence level. Business confidence, consumer confidence, every form of confidence is at an all-time high, or very close, and America is booming. Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.
And we then did the war on clean, beautiful coal, and we are putting -- and you see it better than almost anybody -- our coal miners. They're all back to work, and they're going back to work. Clean coal, clean coal. Nobody thought that was going to happen so fast, either. You know, I was in West Virginia yesterday -- great people.
They like the mines, also. You know that, right? Who makes better coal? Who's got better coal? Huh? Well, they say they do. You both do. But I talk to the leaders of foreign countries. They love our coal, and we're 65 -- either 55 -- I've heard two numbers. I've heard 55 percent and 65 -- either one is OK -- increase in the export of coal to foreign countries this year.
And by the way, it's going much -- they've just gotten started, because I make them buy it. You know, we have these crazy deficits, and we have these horrible trade deals. So I go in, and I say, "You've got to buy our stuff. You've got to buy our coal. You're going to buy our oil. You're going to buy our equipment, and our planes, and our tractors.
You're going to buy our tractors. You've got to buy everything, because we're not going to stand for this imbalance." And they're buying like crazy. They're buying so much, they don't -- they don't even need it. They just want to have me be happy. They want me to be happy, so they're buying your coal, and they're buying everything.
They're buying it. And if they don't buy it, they've got problems, right? They've got problems. And we're strongly protecting Montana farmers, ranchers and loggers. We have not forgotten you people, that I can tell you. And don't forget, for the ranchers and for the small farmers, and some pretty big ones, too, you don't have estate taxes anymore to worry about.
When you leave your farm, you leave your ranch, you leave your things to your children, your children don't have to go out and -- remember, they used to have the expression, "mortgage the farm"? That was for a reason. They'd mortgage the farm to pay the estate taxes. You don't have any death tax, estate tax -- same thing.
You don't have the death tax anymore. Got rid of that. Steve Daines helped a lot. They all helped. Steve Daines -- good guy. Saw him speaking up here before. I saw him speaking. That guy is terrific. Hello, folks. So you don't have -- think of that. Think -- think of what that means, though, seriously. Now, if you love your children, you can leave that farm, or the ranch, or your logging equipment, your logging stuff, your trees -- you can leave whatever the hell you want, if you like them.
If you don't like them, then you don't care too much about this particular tax. But if you love them, you can leave them, and they won't have to mortgage the farm or mortgage whatever it is you're leaving, because they don't have to pay estate tax anymore. Nice, right? It's nice. That's a big one. A lot of people don't talk about these things, like that.
Under Republican leadership, America is respected again... And America is winning again, because we are finally putting America first. It's been a long time. Weeks ago, we achieved another incredible victory for our nation. We proudly confirmed the newest member of the United States Supreme Court... Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
And Senator Tester... voted against, voted against. And I don't know if you just heard -- did you hear? One of his accusers, false accusations, just came out a little while ago and said it was all a lie; that she never met now-Justice Kavanaugh. She never met -- it was a made-up story. She made up the story.
It was a lie. It was a total lie. It was fake. You know what fake means? It was fake. Now think of that. She lied about the story, about rape -- about rape. She lied. And we're supposed to sit back and take it. And supposing he didn't get to be -- and he's a tremendous man. And by the way, what about the others?
What about the others? When are they going to say what happened? And supposing he didn't get -- supposing we didn't stick? A lot of people said, "You know, you stuck with him, sir. It was great." Supposing I didn't? Supposing I was like most other politicians, and I said, "Oh, let's -- let's cut, and let's pick somebody else." We don't do that stuff, because I always knew.
But she just came out and she said it was a lie. It's a damn disgrace. And supposing he was forced -- supposing he was forced to drop out and not become -- this is a great intellect, a great scholar, Yale, one of the top -- for years, they've been saying he should be on the Supreme Court. Supposing because of these lies and this lie -- these lies, by the way, these lies.
But this lie -- supposing he dropped out? A lot of guys would have. I gave him credit, also, for sticking it out. That was brutal. So supposing he dropped out, we picked somebody else, and go through the process. Somebody else goes to the United States Supreme Court, but he drops out, and he dropped out because of a filthy, dirty lie?
Think about that. How about that, right? But you people knew what was going on. But you know what? Your senator, Tester... what he did -- what he did -- what he did was terrible. What he did to Justice -- now-Justice Kavanaugh -- Judge Kavanaugh at that time -- was terrible. It was terrible. And what the Democrats did to him was terrible.
It was a disgrace, OK? And I have to say it. Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters... if they gain the majority, they will try to plunge our country -- and it's not even a question of trying; it's what's going to happen, because their policy is so bad. You know, they're lousy politicians, and they have lousy policy, but they stick together.
One thing I'll say: they stick together. They really do, the Democrats. They -- it doesn't matter what, even a hoax like they tried to pull off with Judge Kavanaugh, they stick together -- or the Russian hoax with the election. They use that as an excuse, because Hillary Clinton lost. Next time, they'll learn.
You've got to go, and you've got to campaign in Wisconsin. You've got to campaign harder in Pennsylvania. You've got to campaign in Michigan. You've got to campaign harder in North Carolina, you know? Not Russia. So they use that -- it's a -- I call it "the Russian hoax." It's a hoax, and they use that in a -- as an excuse for losing the Electoral College that is set up that they should win the Electoral.
I mean, you'd have to run the whole East Coast. You have to win so much, and it's set up. The Democrats should easily win, but you know what? Hopefully, 2020's going to come along. We're going to do even better, even better. And Montana was with me right from the beginning, but you remember? These people back there, some of them, I see.
That's a big -- that's a big crowd of people on a Saturday afternoon. The media. The media -- do you remember? "There is no path to 270." You need 270. "There is no path to 270 -- for me. But we got 306, 306. We got states that they didn't think about. They got -- we got states that haven't been won by a Republican in a long time, and they're great states, and they're very happy right now because they're doing very well, just like Montana is doing very well.
The Democrats want to raise your taxes, restore job-killing regulations. It will kill it. It will -- those regulations, don't underestimate that. The tax cuts were important, but those regulations would have plunged this country -- you would have gone down -- 4.2 percent GDP? You would have gone way down.
You would have had -- you would have started at zero, and you would have gone down a lot. They want to shut down your coal mines; that, you know. They want to shut down the timber mills; that, you know. But you know they're going to shut down the coal. Oh, they're going crazy over the nice, beautiful, clean coal.
And the beautiful thing is, if we have a national emergency, if we have a problem, big problem, there's nothing like coal. You'll truck that stuff around. If the roads aren't there, you'll turn it around and go through a tree. Those windmills -- number one, when the wind doesn't blow, they tend not to do too well.
Right? They tend not to do too well, and they're extremely costly, and they need subsidy. We're paying massive subsidy. And of course, they kill all the birds, you know. Other than that, they're wonderful. No, they don't work too well in times of national emergency. We say, "We need more energy, but the wind isn't blowing." One thing with coal: that sucker, you just keep piling it in there, right?
Right? Those miners. The miners knew what they were doing. And I don't want to speak badly about natural gas, because I know it. But they drop a little something in one of those pipelines -- that's the end of the natural gas, right? But the coal just keeps coming. So just hang in there, folks. You're doing fantastically well, and I'm with you 100 percent.
But they would have killed -- they would have killed the coal industry. It was gone. It was another year or two. The regulations -- people that are in the industry, they came up to me. They said, "It's one of the greatest miracles we've ever seen, because we had another year to live -- it was gone." Most of them were closed up, anyway.
And now, West Virginia, you have to see what's happened there, what's happened here, what's happened in other places. It's really incredible. And if you look at iron ore, where you need the miners, also, what's going on there -- we've revived the steel business. And now we're taking in Minnesota, we opened it up. The finest in the world -- finest in the world -- the iron ore, and it's coming in. Instead of dumping crap all over our country, they dump steel in order to put our steel plants out of business.
And then what they'll do is after they're totally out -- and by the way, you talk about the coal industry; the steel industry was dead. It was going to be dead within a couple of years. It was on its last legs, and now it's one of the hottest industries in our country. You have to see, U.S. Steel, what they're doing... Nucor, building new plants, expanding old plants.
And we're doing good steel, quality steel. We're not taking the junk that gets dumped on our borders. I know a lot about steel. When you have good structural steel for buildings, and for things like airplanes, jet fighters, commercial planes, you want the finest steel in the world. You don't want stuff that was dumped on your shore.
You have no idea what the hell is in there. So it's a whole different world, but our steel industry is booming. They'll end up taking away your healthcare. You know what's going on with that. It's such a disaster. You'll end up tripling your tax. Your tax is going to go through the roof, and it still won't pay for it. They basically want to impose socialism in the United States.
They want to... they want to erase your borders. Your socialism hasn't done very well for Venezuela. Would you say that's not too good? You know, Venezuela, 20 years ago -- less -- was the wealthiest country in that part of the world, by far. Today, they can't buy a loaf of bread. That's socialism. That's socialism.
The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to flood into your communities... depleting our resources and overwhelming our nation. We don't want that. And did you see where Homeland Security -- you know, they were saying, "How do you know? How do you know?" There's some bad people, as I said the other -- bad hombres.
There's some bad hombres in that group. So they came out with a list of 300 really bad ones, really bad ones. They're in there, and now they have worse caravans, actually, worse caravans being formed. It's terrible. The Democrats only believe in defending the borders of foreign countries. They don't want to defend our border, but of foreign countries?
That's fine. And we're straightening that whole mess out, too. It's happening fast. Republicans believe we must defend our borders. We have to defend the borders of our country, and that country is a country that we love, the United States of America. The choice in this election could not be more simple.
A Republican Congress means more jobs and less crime; a Democrat Congress means more crime and less jobs -- very simple, right? I like that. Nothing like simplicity. So this Tuesday, you have to get out and vote. Just make sure. Do it sooner. I guess you can't do it later -- unless you're a Democrat. Then you can do it later.
Then you can. I'm sure they'll -- they'll have no problem. Joining us this afternoon is your terrific Republican senator who's a real friend of mine, Steve Daines. Where is Steve, by the way? Where is he? Where is he? Come here. I've got him. Come here, Steve. I know he just spoke. I saw him on the plane.
Unfortunately, they didn't -- you couldn't hear him. They didn't -- you couldn't listen to the beautiful words, but... So Steve had a little family problem, because during our big vote, as you know, he was here. I said, "Steve, why don't you bring the beautiful couple?" And it is -- "Bring them to Washington.
We'll make it a historic marriage." But I'll tell you one thing: If we needed his vote, he was on the line. He was ready to take off, weren't you, huh? He's been my friend. He's been our friend, and he loves you folks. Thanks, Steve. Fantastic guy. Thank you. On Tuesday, the people of Montana are going to head to the polls to elect a great, new senator to serve alongside of Steve, and to represent your state, and they will represent your state very well, the both -- the people that I'm talking about.
Remember this: a vote for Matt Rosendale, who is a worker... is a vote for low taxes, low unemployment, strong borders and Montana values, real Montana values. A vote for Matt's opponent, far-left Democrat Jon Tester... and by the way, who will never vote for us, just so you understand. I know he's saying wonderful things now about me, and he might be a nice guy, except he tried to destroy Admiral Ronny Jackson... who didn't do -- who's the most clean-cut, wonderful person that you've ever met.
He tried to destroy him, and I've never forgotten it, and it's honestly one of the reasons that I've been here so much. It really is. It really is. It really is. It's a disgrace. What he did to that man... He was President Obama's doctor, President Bush's doctor. He was an admiral and a doctor. His son graduated last year, high in his class from Annapolis.
His son is this beautiful, great son, this incredible family and wife. He tried to destroy that man, all because I said, "Ronny, what do you think about heading up the V.A.?" And he didn't want -- he -- he said, "Sir, I'll do whatever your -- your order is." I said, "Well, I don't want to make it an order.
Would you do it?" "Only if you want me to." So he would -- didn't want it. It's called "Welcome to the world of politics." So he said, "Sir, if you want," and I said, "I'd like to have you do it. You're an admiral. You're a great leader. You're a doctor, incredible family, zero problem in your past -- zero." I said it about two people.
I said that to Admiral/Dr. Ronny Jackson, and I said it to Brett Kavanaugh. I said, "Brett, congratulations. I'm choosing you, and you're going to go so fast. This is going to be so easy. You're perfect -- the best education, the best marks, best grades. You're a great intellect. You're a great scholar.
You have an incredible family. You have nothing in your past. Brett, congrat -- " He said, "This is the greatest day of my life. Thank you, sir." I said, "This will go so quickly in the Senate." And they tried to destroy him. And it was false stuff. I'm being nice, because it's Montana. It was false. And the same thing with Ronny Jackson, but with Ronny Jackson, it was one man who I don't even know.
I never met. He's never called me, because he listens to Schumer. He has nothing to call me about. He will take a -- he will listen to whatever Crying Chuck tells him to do. But he doesn't call me. So I don't really -- I don't really know him. He might be a nice guy, but he tried to ruin an admiral that's as clean cut -- because you have a lot of clean-cut people here.
I can see it. But as -- you take the best person in this group; that's the equivalent of what this man is, and his family. And Jon Tester tried to ruin him in order to -- in order, what? In order, so I'd pick somebody else to run the V.A.? What was the purpose of it? Really, what was the purpose? It wasn't a political threat.
Ronny didn't even really want to do it, in retrospect. I feel guilty, because I'm the one that said, "You should do it," because I thought he'd do a great job. And that's why I'm here, and I'm here also for two -- these two great people. So it's a vote, really, to make Chuck Schumer the majority leader.
I don't think you can do that, and to put extreme liberals in charge of every single Senate committee. Jon Tester says one thing in Montana, but he goes outside and he says the exact opposite in Washington. I mean, let's face it: he's been saying great things about me now. The border, the military -- everything's great.
But you know what? On Wednesday, the day after the election, he'll be saying the opposite. He won't even be saying it; he'll just raise his hand: "No, no, no." And there's nothing we can do about it. There's nothing we can do about it. I said that about Joe Manchin in West Virginia. I like Joe a lot. The problem is, he'll never vote for us. And he did vote for Justice Kavanaugh, but he voted as soon as Susan Collins made her decision, which we very much appreciate.
But as soon as she made that decision -- and now, we had the votes, and then he -- like a quarter of a second later. It was a quarter of a second. She said, "And therefore -- " and I was waiting, because I said, "Joe, vote before. Don't vote after. Vote when we need your vote, not just because it's good for you in West Virginia." And I don't think it's going to help him in West Virginia.
In fact, I think he might have lost his Democrat base by doing it. That's something nobody thought of. But when Joe voted after the vote by literally seconds, it was like, she said, "I am going to support -- " and then, boom! Manchin did... But with Tester, it's an even worse situation. So I'm here for that reason, and we don't want to have somebody that's lockstep with Nancy Pelosi, with Maxine Waters -- Maxine Waters... and Crying Chuck Schumer.
Remember this: Tester voted against your tax cuts. Tester voted against Kate's Law... which is great stuff. Legislation named after Kate Steinle, who was gunned down by a five-time deported illegal alien who should have never been here -- who would have never been here, if I had my way. But we need more votes.
We need Democrat votes, because we don't have -- we have majorities that are like razor-thin. We need more votes. Like, in the Senate, we need 10 votes. We need 10 -- so we have to get 10 Democrat votes. They're not going to do that. There's nothing we can do. We need 60, and we have 51, and out of the 51, we will, on occasion, lose one -- not often.
But Tester voted in favor of sanctuary cities. Tester joined... Tester joined every other Senate Democrat in supporting open-border legislation from the now-legendary Dianne Feinstein. So look, we -- we have a choice. We need the vote. You'll never get John's vote. You'll never get Tester's vote. No matter what you do, he's always going to vote the way he's told, and you need a man that's going to vote for your agenda.
Your agenda is Make America Great Again. That's what your agenda is. It's very... It's a simple agenda. It's a very simple, very straightforward agenda. You know, the new campaign, it's going to be "Keep America Great", right? I don't think -- as much as I love "Make America Great Again," I don't know that we can carry it forward, because people will say, "Well, what did we do for the last four years?
Are we still trying to do that?" No. We've done so well, and we are ahead of schedule, and fairly soon -- I wouldn't sell the caps yet. Keep them for old time's sake. They'll be very valuable someday. But our new slogan will be "Keep America Great," because that's what we're doing. If you want to stop the radical Democrats, you need to retire Jon Tester and support Matt Rosendale.
Matt, come on up. Matt. [Audience chants USA]
Hello Gallatin County! Wow! Thank you, Mr. President. It is no secret that Montana loves our great president, huh? Thank you again for another record-breaking trip to Montana. Mr. President, you kept your promises that you made during your campaign, and for that, we are incredibly grateful. Promises kept.
I applaud your commitment to fighting for our veterans, and as a proud son and brother of a U.S. Marines, I understand the tremendous sacrifices our veterans have made to this nation. Many veterans are here with us today, and I thank you for your service, and I think we all should give them a tremendous round of applause.
You folks know, Jon Tester's had 12 years to fix the problems for the Veterans Administration, and he has failed us. We do not have proper staffing at our facilities. Veterans face long wait times. They can't see the doctors. Many are forced to go out of state to receive their healthcare. That is unacceptable.
I'm tired of the politics and the excuses that have plagued the V.A. for years now. It absolutely has to stop. Our veterans kept their promises to this nation, and it's about time our nation kept its promises to our veterans. To all the veterans, you can rest assured, when I'm in the United States Senate, President Trump and I will keep our promises to the veterans.
You know, folks, Jon Tester must think we're a bunch of fools. He pretends that he works with President Trump, when it's all talk. He doesn't work with the president at all, as the president just explained to you. On every major issue -- tax cuts, building the wall, Supreme Court justices -- Jon Tester stood in the way and voted no. Tester's last rally was with the former president of Planned Parenthood.
I am proud to defend life, and proud to have our president standing here with me. Tester has been too wrong for too long. On Tuesday, we can send Jon Tester and his lobbyist supporters a strong message: Montana is Trump Country... not Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi Country. We have three days until the election, and we need you to get out and vote.
Look at all the incredible work that President Trump has done. He may not be on the ballot this year, but I will tell you, his policies are. President Trump needs our help right now to win this race. I need your help right now to win this race. So please, go tell your friends, your family and your neighbors, "Go vote." Let's win this race and send Jon Tester back to Big Sandy.
Are you with me? Are you with me? All right. Mr. President, thank you for being here today. Thank you all so much for coming out today. May God bless each and every one of you, and these great United States. [Audience chants USA]
Thank you, Matt. You know, Matt was a very successful guy. He didn't need to do this. OK -- no, I didn't either, of course. We both did. But you know, we're having fun. I'm having fun, because we are winning. We're winning so much. We're winning, and that's what we want. We're all winning together. It's not me. We're all -- we're all in this together.
We're winning together. But he was a very successful man. He wanted to do this, and I said, "Go ahead." Then he did fantastically, really, coming out of nowhere. Did incredibly in the primaries, and he's a great, great candidate, and he'll be a fantastic senator. He'll represent you well, so I hope you can get out there and vote for Matt Rosendale, OK? Another man who is incredible, actually, and so supportive, and he's been -- from day one, he's been just a fantastic representative of Montana.
Member of Congress, Congressman Greg Gianforte. He is fantastic. Greg, come up, please. Please. Greg is great on jobs. He's tough on crime, and he will always support our veterans, our military, our police and our Second Amendment, and Greg's opponent, Kathleen Williams, is a left-wing radical. I don't get it. What's going on in Montana?
What's happening here? But truly, a left-wing radical who wants to massively raise your taxes and eliminate your borders. Williams supports Nancy Pelosi's and of course, Maxine Waters' Cap and Trade Bill -- that's another beauty, right? -- and would kill the Montana coal industry immediately -- I mean, immediately if they get in. If she wins, your Second Amendment -- and I know this is not something that's very popular around here -- your Second Amendment would be in big trouble.
That's not a good... that's not a good talking point for them. So if you don't want to say the words "Speaker Pelosi" for the next two years, hopefully you can elect and extend, for a long time, my friend Greg. He's a tremendous guy. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. President. Two quick things: I want to thank you for giving me the great honor to be your lone voice back in the U.S. House. Thank you. And to this great president, Mr. President, on behalf of every person here in Montana, thank you for giving us hope again.
Thank you, Greg. Thank you. Doing a fantastic job, and he's very respected in Washington. I can tell you, some are respected, and some aren't. I can tell you the ones that are, and the ones that aren't, and he is. And Matt will be, when he gets there, there's no doubt about that. If Democrats get the majority, one of their first projects will be a socialist takeover of American healthcare -- you've been seeing it -- meaning taxes like you've never seen before.
The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than 40,000 Montana seniors. You know, the Montana seniors are a lot of them here -- incredible people. They depend on it. It would be obliterated. Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it, and who, by the way, paid for it, right?
They paid for it. And Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. I wish people would get that into their heads, because the other side is fighting pre- -- it's the only thing they have. They have nothing else. We're going to protect pre-existing conditions. You heard it here. You've been hearing it from me for a long time.
Remember Social Security, what I said during the debates, and everybody disagreed with me? We haven't touched your Social Security, right? We haven't touched it. Democrats' plan to destroy healthcare also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants. I know the people of Montana do not mind that at all.
As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to violate our laws, disrespect our rules and overrun our borders. They don't mind. They don't mind. They want them to come in. Look at what's going on in California with your gubernatorial candidate. "Come on in. We're going to pay for your school, your education..." You know, I jokingly said a couple of weeks ago, "And then everybody's going to get a Rolls Royce." And the fake news -- one particular person -- said, "He said that they're going to get Rolls Royces, and that is not true."
Do you believe it? You can't tell a joke with these people. You can't be sarcastic with these people. I'm only kidding. They are not giving out Rolls Royces, please, OK? Fake news. The Democrat Party -- not the Democratic Party, but the Democrat Party wants to sign illegal aliens up for free healthcare, free welfare, free education... and what do they really want?
The right to vote, because they figure that's the way they stay in office forever. Remember that. That's a big move. Illegal immigration costs American taxpayers more than $100 billion every single year, roughly 10 times the entire state budget of Montana. We need to use our precious resources to help Americans who follow our laws, not to reward illegal aliens who break into our country and break our laws.
Democrat immigration policies also enable drug smuggling, human trafficking and criminal cartels. Think of it: human trafficking. Do you know how bad? That's the lowest form of human being that does that. They kidnap people, many, many women. They kidnap, and they human traffic, and they're doing it in the world, worldwide.
The number one -- it's -- it's never been worse than it is right now because of the computer, because of the Internet. It's never been like it is. Human -- think of what human trafficking is. You would have thought that died out 300 years ago. It's at the highest level it's ever been now, because of the Internet, and we are fighting it hard.
We're doing very well. It's horrible. Nearly 100 percent of heroin in the United States enters through the southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, the majority of meth and a substantial portion of the ultra-lethal fentanyl, which is killing our youth. These drugs kill 70,000-plus Americans every single year -- that's 70,000 that we know of -- destroy the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
Last year alone, our brave -- and you have to listen to this, because this number is unbelievable. Our ICE officers arrested more than 127,000 criminal aliens. Can you imagine? These are criminal aliens. These aren't like -- and they want to get rid of ICE. Even you in Montana, you're not going to be able to walk around.
You'll be locking those doors. You'll be locking those windows. You'll be saying, "Oh, I wish we had Matt. I wish we had Matt representing us in the Senate." Including those charged or convicted are 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes, and 1,800 homicides. You know, you don't hear that. I'm the only one that tells you the facts.
You don't hear that. Yet instead of applauding ICE as great nationally -- these are strong people. We're not going to send weak people to take care of MS-13. These are strong people, but they're great patriots. They love our country. The Democrats want to abolish ICE. They want to turn America into a giant sanctuary city for gang members and MS-13 killers if they had their choice, but we're stopping them.
They never thought they'd have a force like this. This was supposed to be a clear path. Guess what? This movement got in their way. This movement got in their way. And now, not only in their way, but now we're pushing it way back where it came from. Came from hell. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens, and Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and your great law enforcement.
And border security is also very much a woman's issue. You know, two years ago the fake news media was saying, "I don't know if this Trump is going to do well with the women." And they said it... I love you, too. I love you. No, they said -- you remember. "Will he do -- " I used to say to people, I said, "What's wrong with going in here?" Except a thing called an election took place, and after the election, in between their tears, as they were crying, they were saying, "Man, did he do well with women." Did he do well.
You saw the numbers. The numbers are the numbers. But women want security. They want financial security, but they want security. They don't want to see -- you saw these caravans. They don't want that caravan, and, by the way, four others that are forming, okay, in countries -- in countries that we give tremendous amounts, hundreds of millions of dollars a year to in aid.
Right? Not anymore. They don't do anything for us. They talk. They talk. They don't do for us, and that's about it for them, because I tell you what: I've had it. They call up: "Oh, we're working so hard." In the meantime, Honduras and El Salvador and all these places, it's horrible, what they're doing to us. It's horrible.
And Mexico's trying, but I think maybe they can try a little bit harder. [Inaudible] Do you think? But I will say, these people were vicious, and they broke through into Mexico, throwing rocks. And so this is the second caravan, which is made up of some very tough young people -- very tough -- criminals in some cases, in many cases.
They'll say, "Do you have proof?" Yeah, I have proof. They threw stones in the police's face. They hurt Mexican police. They hurt Mexican military very badly. They broke through. You saw it. It was on television. It was terrible. And so Mexico is trying. They are trying, but we're different. We more than try.
We have our military now on the border. And I noticed all that beautiful barbed wire going up today. It was some -- barbed wire used properly can be a beautiful sight. Women want safe neighborhoods for their families, great schools for their children, and they want violent predators like we're talking about to be thrown in jail or thrown the hell out of our country, and that's what we're doing.
That's what we're doing. And you know, I've been badly criticized over the last three or four days, because we built the greatest economy in the history of our nation. Jobs -- you people are big beneficiaries -- every state. I mean, look at Alaska. We've got ANWR approved. Look at -- look at what we're doing for every place, every state.
Oh, we have some Alaskans. Are you from Alaska? Wow, look at them. They're going crazy. You should. I handed you about $5 trillion, right? It's one of the largest oil reserves in the world. I got it approved. Started with Ronald Reagan -- they couldn't get it approved. Nobody could get it approved all the way back, and we got it approved, so that's good.
Oh, they -- I -- they're from Alaska. That's great. Give my warmest regards. They need warm regards. Give my warmest regards. Thank you, fellas. That's very nice. But we do a job, and I get criticized because they say, "You know -- " By the way, if I did it the other way, they'd criticize me in this. But they say, "Why is he talking about the border?" Like they're doing me favors, right?
CNN doing me a favor, telling me what to say. Right? CNN is telling me how to run the campaign, but in the meantime, I'm president, and they're not. And their ratings aren't very good either, by the way. You know what? If they'd break it up a little bit. Give me, like, one out of 10, one out of 20 good stories, you know, like North Korea.
Like, give me a decent story on North Korea. Give me a -- give me anything. The economy, give me a good story, OK? You know, if the other administration had continued, our economy would have crashed, our country would have crashed. We would have been in a depression, because the regulations made it impossible.
It was heading down when I took over. And they like to say, "Well, Obama helped." He didn't help. We were going down, folks. We were going down. We were going down. We were going down. But they were telling, you know, giving me advice, a lot of them, oh, just so bad, so pathetic. MSNBC -- you ever watch this garbage?
MSNBC, telling me what to do. They've been hitting me for years now. It's actually hard to believe you can get elected. You turn on, and it's nothing but fake news, horrible news, only -- I don't mind a bad story if it's deserved. But when you do something great and they make it sound fair, just like, OK, you know, you can't make it sound -- they try to make it horrible, but you do good stuff, and they try and make it sound as bad -- MSNBC is probably worse than CNN, all right?
It's probably worse than CNN. But when you do this -- and then they tell you, "He's got the greatest economy. Why is he talking about the border?" Well, you can only say so many times that we just created 250,000 jobs last month, right? Now, I could say it over and over and over again and you'd appreciate it. But instead of this massive crowd that's totally filling up this big hangar -- that is a big hangar -- so much so that we have to go outside.
You know, we're only outside because we picked up more space, and I assume the outside space is cheaper. I hope you didn't pay for the outside space. But once I say 250-, and then I say again, 250-, and again, and I tell you about -- I can only go for four or five minutes with that stuff. And then the crowd says, "We love you," and they start dwindling off.
But what I do is talk about some of the problems that we have. Our economy is doing great, OK? They think I should do it. Even some of the Republicans, they said to me -- except Steve Daines doesn't think that. He thinks I should talk about problems that we want to straighten out, because when we're fixing a problem -- or fixed a problem, there's no reason to go on about it for 45 minutes.
But we have a problem at the border. We have a problem with illegal immigration, and the problem is that the Democrats will not allow us to change the dumbest laws in the history of the world on immigration, because we need their votes, and we don't have their votes -- or we can get more Republicans, which I'd like even better.
But unless we get more Republicans, they have to change the laws, and if they don't change the laws, we're going to have the problem. But now, we're just going to toughen up with the existing laws, and that's what we're doing. We're basically stuck with these horrible laws, and we're toughening up our border like never before, and that's the way it is. But we have to talk about it. So the networks, they criticize me by saying, "Why doesn't he talk about the great economy?" And I just did.
But now we talk about problems that we want to fix. So we're stuck with rotten laws, but we have some very good people, and there's nobody like our great military, especially since we're fixed it -- we fixed it. And this election is about security, and this election is about jobs. For years, you watched as we let foreign countries plunder our wealth, steal our jobs -- you saw it. You were victims of it. But those days are over.
We've added nearly half a million manufacturing jobs. That number's gone up rapidly, too, by the way. Remember, you'd need a magic wand. You're never going to bring -- we're not going to manufacture, right? I never understood that one: We're not going to manufacture anymore. Previous administrations. You'd need a magic wand to bring... Well, we did -- 32,000 last month, we got manufacturing jobs alone.
Very shortly, we're going to be up to 600,000 new, beautiful manufacturing jobs. You know why? Because companies are pouring back into our country. They're coming back to Michigan, car companies, and Ohio, and North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida. They're coming back like you wouldn't believe. They're coming here.
They're coming all over. Now, we made a great new deal with Canada so you don't get ripped off anymore, because you've been hurt by Canada. And we love Canada. We love their national anthem, too, right? Do we love it? "Oh, Canada." Would anybody like to sing "Oh, Canada"? But they were not treating us well.
They weren't treating us fairly. Now, we have a wonderful new deal with Canada, a wonderful new deal with Mexico. It's great. But we're now taking in 1,000 jobs a day, and these are industrial, beautiful manufacturing jobs. It's the most in over 20 years. Nobody thought that could happen again. I recently announced that we're replacing that horrible NAFTA deal, one of the worst trade deals ever made in history.
Nobody talks about that. You look all over this country -- you still have steel mills. You still have factories that are empty, that are dead for years because they moved to Mexico and Canada, and we're replacing it with the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, called the USMCA, which I like -- YMCA. If you have a problem with it, just think of YMCA.
Think of the song, and every time you say, "the USMCA," just think of the song and start dancing, because that's how good the agreement is. The USMCA is a great victory for Montana farmers and ranchers and dairy producers. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's very abusive trade practices, and now they're paying big tariffs on $250 billion, and that could rise very sharply, or we might make a deal, and if we don't, that's OK, and if we do, that's OK. I'm happy either way.
I'm a happy person. I'm a very happy person. I'm a much happier person than you would believe. But America is respected again. Every day, it's promises made, promises kept. That's what we're doing. We've made promises, but we've delivered on much more than the promises that we stated during the campaign.
We've taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs, and you see that. Last week, I signed the initial document. You're going to see drug prices come down substantially. And a month ago, I called up Pfizer and Novartis. I called up these great drug companies. They're great companies, and I said -- they raised the price.
You saw that. They announced a big price increase -- big. I called up the head, I said, "What are you doing? You can't do that. I'm reducing the price of drugs." And you know, the following afternoon, I got a callback. "Sir, we've decided to roll back. We are not going to increase the price of drugs." And then I realized how powerful it is to be the president of the United States.
It's the first time they've ever done that. They rolled them back. And I thanked Pfizer, and I thanked Novartis, and I thanked all the other companies that did. They rolled them back. But we're going to be reducing to help critically-ill patients get life-saving treatments, we just passed -- they've been trying to get this for decades and decades -- Right To Try.
Nobody in this group, hopefully, ever has to use it, but you now have the right to go and get drugs that are in the pipeline if you're terminally ill or very sick, and you can get drugs that you weren't allowed. You know why you weren't allowed? Because they didn't want to hurt you. I said, "The person's very sick.
They're not going to be around. They're OK. They wanted to -- " And they said, "We can't do it legal." I said, "Well, you sign a document where you're exculpated from liability as a nation for allowing them to do this." They said, "That's a good idea." It's -- it's actually incredible. But it's more complicated than that.
It wasn't easy. It was for 40-some-odd years, and we had a lot of help. Greg helped a lot. Greg helped a lot. Greg helped a lot on that one, and I appreciate it, and so did Steve. The combination of those two. But in the -- in the House -- Steve, wouldn't you say Greg was one of our big pushers of that one, right?
That was really something. Steve, thank you. Those two guys were great. But it's very -- it's -- it's wonderful. You know, people used to be terminally ill. They'd go and travel all over the world. They'd go to Asia. They'd go to Europe. They'd go to Africa. They'd -- there'd be some kind of a thing that they heard of. We have a pipeline that's got some of the greatest potential for getting better ever in our history, and you weren't allowed, through criminal procedures, to even think about using it. Now, you can use it, and we've had some phenomenal results, by the way.
So that was three months ago. And last month, I proudly signed the largest bill to fight the opioid epidemic in American history -- fighting hard. We passed Veteran's Choice, and it's such a big thing for Matt. You heard the way he talked. And -- but we got it passed, and now it's being perfected. But having Matt in the Senate will be phenomenal.
But we've done a lot, and Doc Ronny, Admiral Ronny got badly hurt, but I will tell you, we have a great new secretary of the V.A. He's doing a phenomenal job, phenomenal job. You know? Doing a great job. He's doing a great job. But we're giving Montana's great veterans now the right to see a doctor, a private doctor if they have to wait on line.
If that line is long, with -- I mean, people were waiting on line for 10 days, 30 days, 40, 50 days. I mean, Steve will tell you, we -- we had stories. And I kept saying, "Why don't you let them go see a doctor?" Number one, by far, it's more important, but number one, they get better fast. Number two, we actually save a lot of money because they get sicker and sicker.
They can't get to a doctor. We have people that were sick, but not badly, and by the time they see the doctor they're terminally ill, and that's no more. They have choice. They can go. They can see a private doctor, and we pay the bill. And we also passed the V.A. Accountability Law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans -- this has been going on for a long time -- is accountable.
So we say, "You've mistreated our veteran, Jim. Jim, you're fired. You're fired. Get him out. Get him out. Get him out of here." No, we had people that were sadists, I mean, stuff -- stories you wouldn't even believe. You don't -- you don't want to hear about this. Too many young people here. Too many young innocent -- they're probably not so innocent, especially coming from Montana.
But they're young, innocent people. But things that you wouldn't believe were happening, and you couldn't do anything. You couldn't do anything. Now, you can fire them immediately. You get them out. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military, which it needed. It was very depleted.
It was tired. It was exhausted from fighting, fighting all over the place. We're fighting. We're defending all these rich nations. They're not giving us anything. Those days are soon changing. You see what's going on. I'd say, "Why are we defending this nation when they're so wealthy?" "Well, sir, they're a great ally." They're not a great ally.
We're -- we're taking care of their military. It's a very unfair thing. That's all changing. Oh, I thought it was a fighter jet. It didn't sound that good though. The fighter jets, the new F-35s sound slightly better than that plane. And we're purchasing the finest planes in the world. We make the finest equipment in the world.
By the way, much less importantly, in this case, but it's all made in the USA, everything. Tanks, missiles -- we're purchasing all of that great equipment. We make the best missiles. We make the best tanks. We make the best rockets. We make the best of everything -- all made in the USA, all brand new, all perfect stuff.
Our military will very shortly be, far and away, the strongest it's ever been in the history of our nation, and hopefully, we'll have... hopefully, we will never have to use it. And you know the way you don't have to use it? By doing exactly what I'm doing, OK? You go the other way, you'll end up having to use it, and it won't be pretty.
At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, the Space Force. That's good. That's good. Space Force. That's where it's at, you know? It's like, sounds a little bit out there, but it's -- and it is out there. Oh, that's beautiful. Hold that up. Look.
That's beautiful. That's beautiful. It's happening. Everyone wants it. But that's where it's at. That's where the future of the military, big portions of the military is at. So we're going to be the Space Force, and that'll go pretty quickly. It's already started. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal.
And we just announced that we are putting in place the biggest sanctions that we've ever placed on any country. The Iranian regime, what a deal they made -- $150 billion -- $1.8 billion in cash. You know, anybody know what $1.8 billion in -- in cash looks like? I don't even know. I don't know. No -- who knows?
Plane loads -- ridiculous. We've recognized the capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Together, we've made extraordinary progress, and we're just getting started. But the Democrats want to turn back the clock, put America in reverse, and give power back to a corrupt, selfish ruling class that only looks for power and for themselves.
But we are not going back. We are only going forward. We need you to vote for a Republican House and a Republican Senate so we can continue this incredible movement, the greatest movement in political history, the greatest movement our country has ever seen. And with your votes, we will keep on cutting your taxes, reducing your regulations and raising your incomes, and that's what's been happening.
Your incomes have been going up. We will protect Medicare, and we will protect your Social Security, which they cannot do. We will defend your right to free speech, religious liberty and we will continue to confirm judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border. We will pass Kate's Law.
We will stop sanctuary cities, stop catch-and-release, end the visa lottery, end chain migration -- you know how bad that is -- and we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, terrorists the hell out of our country. We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity.
For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. You saw that. They apologized for our country. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Montana, and we are proudly standing up for our National Anthem. I am asking every citizen from every party, every background and every race, color and creed to reject Democrat politics of anger and division, and reclaim our proud and righteous destiny as Americans.
We need you to get your family, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and go out and vote Republican. This Tuesday, I need the people of Montana to send Crying Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and the radical Democrats a message by -- and this is such a great message -- by voting for Greg Gianforte and Matt Rosendale.
So important. Loyal citizens like you help build this country, and together, we are taking back our country, and we are returning power to where it belongs: with you, the American people. That's what's happening again. That's what's happening. This great state was built by tough frontiermen and strong pioneer women who braved the wilderness to build a life and a home under the big, bright, beautiful Montana sky that the whole world talks about, the whole world.
The whole world talks about it, and I know why: it is big and beautiful. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. These incredible, courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy, tear down our history and destroy our proud American heritage.
They didn't do it for that. They don't want to sit back and watch. They're not going to. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down.
We will never surrender, and we will always fight on to victory, always. Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together, Montana, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Montana. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Hello, Montana. This is going to be a lot of fun. Thank you.
There's no place like a Rosendale rally, forget Trump. Rosendale. But there is no place like a Trump rally, right? We have a good time. We have a good time.
And in the election, we won this state by a lot. That was not close. But I am thrilled to be back in Big Sky Country with so many of my great friends and true American patriots. Thank you.
Thank you. From the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, the people of Montana love our country, love our country so much. They honor our values, and you always respect our great American flag. You see what's happening.
This is an incredible time for our nation. We have the best economy in history. The stock market is at record highs. Unemployment is at historic lows. And more Americans are working today than ever, ever, ever before.
That's a great stat, isn't it? Think of it. More Americans today. And it grows every week. Every week, it gets higher, higher. But more Americans are working today than have ever worked before in our country. A great stat. That's a big stat. Our coal miners are back to work.
And we are fighting every day for our great ranchers and loggers and farmers, and we're winning that fight and we're winning it quickly. We're rebuilding our military, crushing the terrorists, and taking care of our veterans.
America is winning again, and America is being respected again. As you all saw this week, the Senate is now considering a truly exceptional nominee for the United States Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. And he's doing really well. But do you believe the anger and the meanness on the other side? [Audience Boos]
Sick. It's sick! The whole country is now seeing his amazing intellect and his brilliant legal mind. Judge Kavanaugh deserves overwhelming bipartisan support. And I think he's going to be one of our truly great Supreme Court justices.
So tonight we're joined by truly terrific Republican leaders from the great state of Montana, including a friend of mine, an incredible senator, somebody that works so hard, and I can tell you -- I don't want to embarrass him -- but I'm going to tell you, he loves you, Senator Steve Daines. Where is Steve? Thank you, Steve. Great job. Steve is a worker and he does an incredible job.
You also have a great attorney general, who I've gotten to know over the years, Tim Fox, doing a fantastic job. Thank you, Tim. Thanks, Tim.
Your secretary of state, Corey Stapleton. Corey? Thanks, Corey. State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and he's just -- I mean, this is a fantastic person, Elsie Arntzen. Elsie, thank you. Thank you, Elsie. Great job. Been fantastic. You are really -- she has done some job. I've heard all about you, your reputation. Thank you very much. And your outstanding Montana GOP Chairwoman Debra Lamb.
So, Debra, how are we doing now compared to Election Day almost three years ago? Could you believe it? How are we doing? Better? Even better? Good. That's what we're doing in most states. And the states that we won, we're doing better. Thank you. Thanks. Great job. Great job, Debra.
I'm also thrilled to be joined by Montana's terrific member of Congress, a true champion for Montana, and I'll tell you what, this man has fought in more ways than one for your state. He has fought for your state. Greg Gianforte. He is a fighter and a winner. He's a winner. Great.
He loves your state. Thank you very much, Greg. Great job.
Everybody has to get out and vote for Greg and vote for people that are going to vote for us, because without that, you're going to lose a lot of the things that we've won over the last two years. You're going to lose them, and you're going to lose them fast. Can't let that happen. But I'm here for a very specific reason. Please welcome the person that we have such respect for, he's now leading in the polls.
But I don't want to say that. I want to say he's just a little bit, like, one or two points behind. Is that OK, Matt, for me to say that? But he is somebody who is going to be a phenomenal United States senator from Montana, Matt Rosendale. Matt, come on up. Matt? Where is Matt? Come on up, Matt. Come on up, Matt.
Welcome back to Montana, Mr. President. This crowd is all here for you. And what a crowd it is. Thank you for fighting for us and for always putting America first. Montana is going to write a wrong this November, and we're going to send you the conservative reinforcements that you need to continue your good work.
My promise to each and every one of you is that I will always put Montana first and stick with President Trump to make sure we advance his agenda.
We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare and give you options on health care that you can actually afford. We're going to protect your public lands and fight against the liberals that are trying to grab your guns.
We're going to confirm more justices like Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, people that will uphold the Constitution and defend your Second Amendment rights. Speaking of the Second Amendment, we have some breaking news tonight. We were informed and learned last night that the NRA has endorsed my campaign.
We're going to secure our border, enforce our laws, and build that wall.
Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!
We're going to keep this economy growing, your taxes low, and keep government off of your back and out of your wallet.
We've all seen the problems with big government, politicians representing themselves and not us, intoxicated with privilege and power. They start worrying about the next election instead of the next generation. President Trump, I agree with you: We need term limits.
That's why, if you elect me, I promise to serve no more than two terms. The people of Montana support term limits. They believe in doing your job and returning home, and so do I.
President Trump, thank you for your support. We need everyone in this room and across this state to step up, and we can win this race. President Trump and I are counting on you to help us here. So tonight, I humbly stand before each and every one of you and ask for your vote this November.
Together, we will win this race, and we will send President Trump the support and help that he needs back in Washington. Thank you, Montana. Thank you, President Trump. May God bless each and every one of you and the United States of America. Thank you.
Thank you, Matt, very much. Thank you.
Matt Rosendale. Very, very important, very, very important that we elect Matt and, frankly, other Republicans. We have to get the Republicans -- we'll get things we want. We've started the wall. Everybody wants the wall. We've spent $3.2 billion on the wall. We've got to get the rest of the funding. We're going to get.
The Democrats want to obstruct that. They want to obstruct our great justices. And by the way, you obstruct these justices, you're going to lose your Second Amendment. You're going to lose your right to those guns. You're going to lose your Second Amendment. So be careful. Be careful. Be careful. [Audience Boos]
And don't forget, Tester is going to vote with the Waters and the Pelosi. Can you imagine? Maxine Waters is your new leader in the party. [Audience Boos]
Can you believe it? Maxine Waters. She's sure something. But he's going to vote for Schumer. They're going to do whatever they say. They -- I will say this. I will say this. The one thing, their policies are horrible. They're for open borders, meaning let all the crime come in. They're against so many things that you want.
You know, I've been saying and I've been saying it strongly, they're going to take away -- they're going to hurt your Social Security so badly, and they're killing you on Medicare. Just remember that. I'm going to protect your Social Security. We're going to take care of your Social Security. Matt Rosendale is going to make sure we're not touching your Social Security and your Medicare is only going one way. That's stronger. They're going to end up taking it away from you, and you won't even know what happened.
And on top of that, you're going to pay more taxes. It's crazy. Jon Tester will never drain the swamp, because he happens to live in the swamp and he loves the swamp. [Audience Boos]
Jon Tester -- I feel a little guilty, because, you know, he did run the most beautiful commercial. I heard yesterday it started, and he's like my best friend, President Trump this, President Trump that. It's amazing when you win a state by a lot of points how even Democrats can like you. Isn't that crazy?
But the problem is, he's never going to vote for me. He's not going to vote. But he's taken more cash from lobbyists than almost anyone in the entire Senate. He's controlled by his donors. One of the saddest things I've seen is when Jon Tester and what he did to a great, great man, Admiral Ronny Jackson. [Audience Boos]
Admiral Jackson was subjected to horrible lies and smears. Now, I'm, you know, a victim of that, too, but I'm sort of getting used to it. [Laughter]
At least it's my job. You know, I was going to say I'm a politician. I never thought I was going to say I'm a politician. Can you believe -- I guess I'm a politician, you know? I guess I'm a politician. Think of it. I didn't want to say that. One of the few times I've said it. Yeah, I'm a politician.
But, you know, I've only run once, and that was for president, and I won. How did that happen? Right? Wasn't that nice? I run once and I won. A lot of people have spent their lives trying to be president. We know them all. Some we respect, and some we don't respect too much.
But Ronny Jackson, he's a doctor, he's an admiral. He's actually the doctor that gave me my physical. And he said that I'm in great shape.
And the Democrats and liberals, and deep state, they were very upset to hear that. So they got tougher and tougher, and they lied more, and they write more books now. I never saw -- I have books that are stacked up this high. Actually, the ones that are really good are number one, two, and three on the bestsellers list, right? The ones -- the really good ones by Justice, you know -- I call her Justice, but she's judge, but she's Justice to me -- Jeanine, we love her. Judge Jeanine. By Gregg Jarrett. How about Bongino? He's got a very successful book. How about Bongino?
So many. And they're all doing great. And that's what makes me happy. But the media doesn't talk about those books. No, they talk about the bad ones, of which there are plenty. They're lies, but they're plenty.
But Admiral Jackson, his reputation was attacked. And all of those horrible things that were said about him turned out to be lies and they turned out to be false. Remember? People don't want to say that.
In the last election, Washington Democrats put Jon Tester in charge of electing extreme liberals. I mean, I'm talking about serious liberals, many of whom you're watching attacking Judge Kavanaugh and looking like fools, frankly. Looking like fools. And one of them will most likely be a candidate to run against your favorite of all time president, me. Me.
But when I see the anger in their eyes, when I see the anger of what they say, to an intellect far greater than theirs, not even a contest, but I see the anger and the hatred, what's -- what are they doing? What are they doing? They're losing by doing it. They're losing by doing it.
I just want to finish off, though. What Tester did to Admiral Jackson should never, ever be allowed. Ronny Jackson is a great man. Ronny Jackson has led a great and beautiful life. And to have lies told about him, I would never repeat what they are. See, in my case, they repeat them. I say don't repeat them, they're terrible. They say, no, we're going to deny them. Do we love Sean Hannity, by the way? Right?
I love him. But here's the only thing. He puts up all these losers that say horrible things. I've got to talk to him. One after another. Donald Trump, he's lost it up here. And it's pretty tough. I stand up here giving speeches for an hour-and-a-half, many times without notes. And then they say he's lost it. And yet we have 25,000 people showing up to speeches. And by the way, look at all the fake news back there. [Audience Boos]
Donald Trump. They go Donald trump. You know, it's really funny. Donald Trump's lost it.
So I beat 17 great Republicans, I beat senators, I beat governors, a couple of people, great people, like Ben Carson. I beat a lot of great people. Ben Carson was tough. But I beat 17 great people. And I respectfully say, I beat the Bush dynasty. OK? That felt good. Pretty recently. OK. Now I have the privilege of going against crooked Hillary Clinton. [Audience Boos]
So I beat -- I beat crooked Hillary.
I beat crooked Hillary. And the Electoral College is hard. It's, frankly, if we didn't know better, and maybe we're starting to find things out that we didn't know, it's hard and harder to win than popular vote. Popular vote, you go to three, four states, and boom, boom, boom, you win the -- it's like the hundred yard dash versus running the mile. You practice differently.
She forgot that. She forgot to go to a couple of very important states. Gee, I don't think I'm going to go to Michigan too much. I don't think I'm going to go, she said, to Wisconsin. I do hear her husband said, you know, you better go to Michigan, you better start going to Wisconsin. Well, fortunately, she didn't listen to that.
But -- but think of it. So I beat the Republicans, governors, senators. I beat the Bush dynasty. Respectfully. I beat Hillary, who stole it from Bernie. Bernie should have won, but that's OK. They stole it. Superdelegates. How do you like superdelegates? But she's got superdelegates that were handed to her.
Bernie should be angry. Why isn't he angry? Crazy Bernie. He is so crazy. But, you know what, I saw him the other day on television. And he's ranting and raving. He's sitting behind a microphone, "I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this, blah, blah, blah," the hair's flying, he's going crazy. He's going crazy.
And I said to my wife, "Honey, look at that guy. You got to hand it to him." No, you've got to hand it to him. He doesn't quit. He doesn't give up. I just don't understand why he allowed that to happen, and he goes back into being an independent. But now he's coming back in, and I guess he's going to run. He's going to run. But think of it. So you beat two dynasties, you beat all these politicians. Charles Krauthammer, when I announced that I was going to run...
...he said, why would he run? This is the -- well, he didn't know me, so I'm not insulted. He said, this is the finest field of Republicans ever assembled. I actually did -- I looked at my wife, I said, you know, that's his business. He just said these are the finest ever assembled. Why am I doing this? And then I said, ah, that's OK, I'll do it anyway. Let's see what happens. Let's see what happens.
So I beat all these senators, all these governors, all these brilliant political minds. Then I beat the other side. And then I listened. Is he competent? I think I'm pretty competent, right? Don't you think so?
Is he competent? And their ratings are down the tubes. You know why? Because people get it. They really get it. But it is funny to hear that you have all these victories -- and, you know what, more important than those victories, we're winning in the United States now. We're winning on trade. We're winning with our military. We're knocking the hell out of the terrorists. We're winning now in the United States.
You look at what's going on. We have new deals being made. We have a deal we just made with Mexico. That's a fair deal. It's not that horrendous deal that was made years ago that should have been changed years ago.
We're negotiating with Canada. We'll see what happens. We're in a little bit of a skirmish, but doing really well with China. You see what's going on. Really well.
I have great respect for President Xi of China. But honestly, we have to be treated fairly. Last year, we had a trade deficit of anywhere from $375 billion -- with a B dollars -- to, I say, $504 billion. Either one is not acceptable.
So we're doing that. And it's working out very well. I just came on stage, and I was told that Kim Jong Un said some terrific things about me. He said I have faith in President Trump.
Think of this. You don't hear that from them. And just moments ago, they put on -- they put on that he said very strongly that we want to denuclearize North Korea during President Trump's tenure. That's a nice -- he just said it. Just said it.
But in the meantime, even if he didn't, even if he didn't, we got our hostages back. There's been no more missile testing. There's been no more rockets flying over Japan. There's been no more nuclear testing. And we have a good feeling. He likes me, I like him. Who knows what's going to happen?
But I can tell you what, the day before I took office -- and even, I must say, because as you know, the rhetoric was fairly tough -- it's interesting. With him, I had very tough rhetoric. And the fake news was saying it's too tough, he's going to get us into the war. It's terrible, he's being too tough. It's horrible. What does he know about this? He knows nothing. I watched all of these guys who have been losing for 30 years explaining why my method of negotiation wasn't working. Right?
And I'll tell you what, I respect him, and he respects me. And I think something is going to happen. Take your time. I say, we -- take your time. Sanctions are on. But think of it. We got back our hostages. I didn't pay $1.8 billion. We got back our hostages. Paid nothing. We paid nothing.
But it's funny, you know, because other than NATO, because I got them to pay billions and billions of dollars more, because we're paying for NATO. We're paying this massive percentage of cost. We're protecting Europe. But I got them to pay billions of dollars more, and the fake news said he wasn't respectful to the leaders of other countries. And they're right, in a way, because I said, listen, folks, I'm sorry, you're going to have to pay up. You got to pay up. You're delinquent. You know, in real estate, we say you're delinquent.
And somebody asked me, it's really amazing they never covered this, because if they do, they would have said this is terrible. One of the leaders in front of the other 28 nations, one of the leaders -- who I get along with -- they respect us now, because they couldn't believe -- for years, NATO spending was going like this. By the way, this is spending to protect them against Russia. You know, they keep talking about Russia. We're protecting -- I got them to pay billions of dollars more. OK?
But they said, sir, could we ask you one question? It's always nice when a president or a prime minister calls me sir. That means he has a certain respect. He said, if you don't walk away from these meetings with us paying what we're supposed to be paying or much more, will you leave us? I said yes, I will. And they all said...
And they all said we'll pay. We'll pay. Now, the mainstream media doesn't want me to say that. They want me to say no, no, sir, we'll never leave you. But then there's no reason for them to pay, right? Why would they pay?
Supposing they asked me the same question. Sir -- and we're talking about billions -- and last year, Secretary Stoltenberg, Secretary General, head of NATO, he goes -- he's like my biggest fan. And I like him, too. But he goes around saying, last year -- that was when I just did a -- because, you know, I was only in office for about 14 seconds, so I couldn't -- you know, I didn't want to use too much bravado. You know much they paid extra? Forty-four billion dollars. That was last year.
This year, it's much higher, because now I feel comfortable. I asked him in a more firm manner. And they're paying, and they should pay. But they were saying that I didn't treat them well. If I would've done what they said, or if I would have done what these consultants and these people that I watch on television, we used to do this stuff, they all failed. They failed miserably.
So we have our own way. It's a great way. But it's really interesting, because when I was dealing with North Korea, and they were saying, "He's too tough, he's too tough." One of my best meetings ever was with Vladimir Putin. And they said, "He was too nice. He was too nice." They wanted me to have a boxing match on this stage.
We had a great meeting. We talked about Ukraine. We talked about Syria. We talked about the protection of Israel. We talked about so many great things. But they came back, and they said, "It was terrible." I said, what was terrible? We had a great meeting.
And, you know, when I came off stage, they all said that was a great meeting. Thank you, that was a great news -- then I got onto the plane and they said, sir, I don't think they liked it. I said they liked it, they're just fake. They're fake news. We had a great meeting. It was a great meeting. [Audience Boos]
And, you know, the funny thing? If I was tough, if I were to say you're never going to do this again, there will be no more of this and no more of that, and stood him in the face and then started boxing, you know what would've happened? They would have said, he's too tough, that was a disgrace to our nation. The truth is, with these people, you can't win, but we're winning. I'm president. You're president. We're winning.
So everybody knows Jon Tester's game. He says one thing in Montana, but does the exact opposite in Washington. That's what happens. He will come home and tell you about your Second Amendment, then he'll vote for something where you knock the hell out of it. Jon Tester talks like he's from Montana, but he votes like he's Nancy Pelosi. That's what he does. He's a Nancy... [Audience Boos]
No, look at his -- look at his voting. It's the same voting as Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and the legendary Maxine. Jon Tester voted no on tax cuts. And he voted for the Obamacare disaster, which we almost repealed and replaced, but we'll get it done. And remember this. Remember this. We got rid of the most unpopular element of Obamacare, right? The individual mandate.
We got rid of the individual mandate. That was the most unpopular single -- that is where you have the right to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay a fortune for bad health care. Right? It's incredible.
But we got rid of it. We'll get rid of all of it. And, you know, one thing I have to say, also, Obamacare was going up 115 percent, 125 percent, 80 percent, 60 percent, 53 percent, all different places. It was going up massively. You know, we want to repeal and replace it, and if we get enough Republicans, we will, and we'll have a much better health care -- we've already come up with some of them, association care, et cetera.
But -- but to do it, and we will do it, we had it, we had it done, we had it done. But remember, Tester voted no. He voted no on Kate's Law. Kate's Law. What could be better than Kate's Law? [Audience Boos]
He voted no on enhanced vetting for refugees. Let's not vet them. Let's just let them pour right into Montana. And you see what's going on. [Audience Boos] And Jon Tester voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities. Tell me that. [Audience Boos]
So that's not a person from Montana. I have a lot of friends in Montana. I don't get -- I mean, I don't get it. How did he get elected? How did he get elected? Jon Tester voted for very liberal Obama judges 99 percent of the time. And yet he would make it impossible for an incredible, distinguished admiral, doctor not to get in. Figure that one.
And yet super liberal judges, many of whom are mocked and scorned, and Jon Tester voted against our incredible Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. How do you do that? [Audience Boos]
How do you do that? First in his class at Harvard. First in his class at Oxford. And he decides, I think I'll vote no. And by the way, Justice Gorsuch is great and he's doing a fantastic job. And Justin Kavanaugh will do the same job.
It's embarrassing to watch those people make fools of themselves as they scream and shout at this great gentleman. This election, you aren't just voting for a candidate. You're voting for which party controls Congress, very important thing. Very important thing.
I don't even bring it up, because I view it as something that, you know, they like to use the impeach word. Impeach Trump. Maxine Waters, "We will impeach him." But he didn't do anything wrong. It doesn't matter, we will impeach him. We will impeach. But I say, how do you impeach somebody that's doing a great job that hasn't done anything wrong? Our economy is good. How do you do it? How do you do it? How do you do it? We will impeach him. But he's doing a great job. Doesn't matter. Remember that line. He's doing a great job. That doesn't matter, we'll impeach him.
It is a hell of a place in Washington. You know, I was thinking, if that happened, every time a Republican or a Democrat opposite got elected president, so let's say a Democrat gets elected someday -- hopefully it's a long time. [Audience Boos]
But let's say a Democrat gets elected. And let's say we have a Republican House. We will impeach that Democrat, right? And then a Republican. We won by a lot. We won by a hell of a margin. That's a lot of -- that's a lot. That Electoral College, we won by a lot.
OK, so we're in there. We've got the best employment numbers in our history. We've got the best economy in our history. You look at the numbers in every category, it's great. We're doing a great job. We're putting on phenomenal judges. And you take that, and you do, then what? You're going to have -- you'll have a country that's going to turn into a third world country.
Because if the opposite party becomes president, every time before it even starts, before you've even found out whether or not he or she is going to do a great job, they'll say, "We want to impeach him," and you'll impeach him. It's so ridiculous.
But we'll worry about that if it ever happens. But if it does happen, it's your fault, because you didn't go out to vote. OK? You didn't go out to vote. You didn't go out to vote. That's the only way it could happen. I'll be the only president in history -- they'll say what a job he's done. By the way, we're impeaching him.
Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by haters, absolute haters, left-wing haters, angry mobs, deep state radicals, and their fake news allies. Those people are the best. They're the best allies. [Audience Boos]
I mean, you look at the Washington Post or the New York Times, I can never get a good story. I mean, you look at this horrible thing that took place today, it's really -- is it subversion? Is it treason? It's a horrible thing. Even -- you know the good thing about that? Even liberals that hate me say that's terrible what they did. And it is really terrible.
You know, when I won the election, the New York Times, all their subscribers were leaving, and when I'm ultimately no longer president, and hopefully about six-and-a-half years from now...
...the New York Times will go out of business. All of them will be out of business. CNN will be out of business. They're almost out of business now, if you look at their ratings [Inaudible] out of business.
But they'll be out of business. But the New York Times, you remember, it's very famous. Nobody's ever seen it before, maybe never done before. They apologized for their bad coverage of me. They apologized to their subscribers, because after I won, everybody said, what the hell happened? What happened? We're reading this piece of garbage and the guy that they kill every day, he won.
So they wrote -- does anybody remember -- there was a very big story -- they wrote an apology to their subscribers to stop the flow of people leaving and giving up their subscription to the New York Times. And it was quite amazing to watch. And, you know, honestly, for two weeks, they really covered me well.
And then it began. And then it got worse and worse and worse. And now we've reached an all-time level. The level of hatred is quite creepy, but that's OK.
On the way over here, I saw a liberal pundit. He was filled with anger. And he was attacking me and our great administration. We have great people. I'll tell you, the White House is really working good. They had -- my wife put out a tweet today. Did you see that she put -- she used to do this. She put out a tweet.
They had me stomping around screaming with anger up in my area of the White House where I live with my wife and son, Barron. They had me screaming, shouting like a lunatic. And I had a television. I said, what are they saying? I had six people in my office. I was in the Oval Office. We're having a talk on trade. Actually, it happened to be trade with Canada. They were telling me what's happening. And they said, sir, you're not up there screaming and ranting and raving. You're here talking. That's how dishonest it's become.
But I asked a young, bright staffer of mine, why are they so filled with this much hatred? Why? Our country is thriving. Jobs are booming. Prosperity is strong. And the future has never looked brighter for the USA. And the young aide looked at me and he said, Mr. President, these liberal pundits, the haters, but they're so angry because you've upset their entire way of life. It's true.
But I said, but -- but let's get this straight. So the country is really doing well. And he looked at me and he said something that maybe is true. I find it hard to believe. He said, sir, they just don't care. It's really pretty sad, right?
You know, when you look at what's happening, with all of it, including our military rebuilding, we're rebuilding, and everything that we're building is being made right here, the best missiles in the world, the best planes in the world, the best ships in the world.
It's all being made right here in the United States. The so-called resistance is angry because their horrible ideas have been rejected by the American people, and it's driving them crazy. Crazy. They're the ones, honestly, that have been driven crazy.
The latest act of resistance is the op-ed published in the failing New York Times by an anonymous -- really an anonymous, gutless coward. You just look. He was -- nobody knows who the hell he is, or she, although they put he, but probably that's a little disguise. That means it's she.
But for the sake of our national security, the New York Times should publish his name at once. I think their reporters should go and investigate who it is. That would actually be a good scoop.
That would be a good scoop. Unelected deep state operatives who defy the voters to push their own secret agendas are truly a threat to democracy itself. And I was so heartened when I looked -- I think it's backfired. Seriously. People that don't exactly dig us and they don't exactly like me, they're fighting for us. It's an incredible -- it's actually a beautiful thing. We picked up a lot of support, because at some point this whole thing is going to be exposed. And it's really bad, and it's really dangerous, and it's really sad for the media and the mainstream media. It really is sad.
When I told you about the good news coming out of Korea today, they will hardly even report it. If this were President Obama, that would be the biggest story in the history of our country. But it's going to be sooner or later -- it will be exposed. The policies of our political opponents have brought about only failure, destruction, and humiliation to our country. Look at what happened. Look at where we were, and look at where we are.
And we have tremendous potential upward -- and other countries, by the way, are not doing well at all. And had I not won, we would have been in negative -- we wouldn't be at 4.2%. We would have been in negative numbers. We were going down. We were low, and we were headed down. We freed up this country with the regulations and the tax cuts. We freed up our country, and it's great to watch.
But if you don't elect Matt, I will tell you, they can change it very quickly. They said -- Nancy Pelosi said yesterday she wants to raise your taxes. [Audience Boos]
I mean, OK, tell me, is raising your taxes like supposed to be a popular thing to do? Because what's going on, they have been driven so far left, I don't know why they don't talk about red waves. I mean, historically, the person that's president, when you have the party having the president, they don't do well in midterms, but nobody's ever had, ever, an economy like we have. Nobody's ever had this economy. So hopefully you're going to remember it.
They robbed our middle class while spending trillions of dollars on adventures overseas. And we're pulling way back, but we still -- we're so respected now. You can pull back a little bit, but we're so respected. They're not playing games with us anymore, folks. They're not playing games.
I don't -- I don't want to tempt them too much by telling you things that don't happen anymore to us, because there's no reason for me to tell you, but when you see some of the things that happened four years ago and six years ago and eight years ago, you take a look at what happened and you take a look at what happens now, where we took that horrible Iran deal and we terminated it, and you look at what's going on.
We're respected again as a nation. We're respected again as a nation. But these people enriched themselves while shipping our jobs to other countries. And they oversaw the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. It's true. This is the greatest treasure.
NAFTA was such a bad deal. Some people said, oh, please, would you extend NAFTA? I said we have to renegotiate it. It's such a bad deal. And when I was campaigning, I said we'll either terminate it or renegotiate it. I don't care. But so far, it looks like it could happen where we'll renegotiate it.
But these disastrous policies were on the ballot box in 2016, and they lost, and they lost big. That's why we're here. In 2016, the American people voted to reject this corrupt globalism. They voted to reclaim their independence and their pride. And they voted most importantly to make America great again. It's very simple.
Soon we'll be changing it to keep America great. Keep America great. Soon. When should we do that, by the way? OK, wait a minute. Soon we're going to have to change, because we are doing well. So when do we change make America great again to keep America great? I don't know.
Soon. Soon. We're draining the swamp. And the swamp is fighting back. But don't worry. We will win. We will win. We always win. We always win. This November, you need to vote Republican. Vote for Matt Rosendale and vote to put America first. Have to do it. Have to do that.
Republicans stand for stopping illegal immigration, fixing horrible trade deals, cutting your taxes in a major, major way, biggest tax cut in the history of our country. And in addition to that, we've got ANWR. You know what that is, right, in Alaska? They've been trying to get that approved for 50 years. We got it approved. It's part of that plan.
We'll be defending your Social Security, which the Democrats will destroy, and we're going to be defending your Medicare and protecting the safety net for truly needy Americans, people that need help, that are Americans, not for people that come into our country illegally.
Democrats want to raise your taxes. They want to raise them. I don't get it. I don't think I could win if I said I'm going to raise your -- ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to raise your taxes. Oh, good. Alice, I don't we're voting for that guy. They want to raise your taxes. I don't know. Maybe they know something I don't know. Blue wave? We're going to raise your taxes. We're going to let crime go all throughout our country. We're going to get rid of ICE, so that as the crime comes in, we're going to have none of our people that are so tough -- these are great people, but these are tough, strong -- these are -- these are warriors. These are warriors.
I don't want to do it, you don't want to do it. I'm looking at these people in the front row, two of whom I know. They don't want to do it. ICE doesn't, like, hey, let's like -- let's go out to dinner. They have done an incredible job.
So they want to raise your taxes, they want to open your borders, they want crime to pour in, because that's what's going to happen when you open your borders. How about the governor, the governorship of California? He just announced that he wants to open borders and he wants to let anybody come in that wants to. And then he wants to pay for all medical, for all school.
What happens, I said, if the entire world decides to go to California, because they get free health care, free medical care, and free education? California has just increased in size to 500 million people. California has just become one really large person. California -- think of it. He says, I want to open the border, I want everyone to come in, at the same time for illegal aliens and illegal immigrants. Lot of different names. He wants to get rid of us.
He wants to cut down on law enforcement. And he wants to pay for their medical, their health care, and their education. But I really asked -- look, it's all about common sense, right? I think I won because of common sense. And because...
...like you, like you, you, me, we're smart, we're really smart. But I said to myself, just common sense, everyone is going to come in. I may even move to California to get free health care. [Laughter]
I may move there. The last time Democrats were in power, they cut Medicare by more than $700 billion to pay for the scandalous Obamacare. Now Democrats want to steal trillions of dollars from Medicare. They're going to ruin your Medicare. Watch. They want to turn America into Venezuela. I don't think so. [Audience Boos]
Democrats would destroy Medicare with Medicare for all -- you heard that -- Medicare for all, until they run out of money, which would be like in the third day. [Laughter]
And then it would be Medicare for none, or it will be one-tenth Medicare what you used to get. They want to rob our seniors of their Medicare benefits, and they want to raid your Social Security. They will destroy your Social Security. And I'm going to save your Social Security. We're not touching your Social Security. Do you remember when I ran?
Do you remember when I ran? I said I'm not touching Social Security. Everybody said -- well -- and everybody else wanted to do things with Social Security. I said, we're not touching your Social Security. All right? I didn't touch your Social Security. Remember what I said? Growth. Growth will take care of it. Growth. And that's what's happening.
We are growing beyond what anybody expected, beyond what those people thought was possible. We're growing. It's called growth. A lot of money is coming in.
Democrats also want open borders. And all of that equals massive costs. Massive. And massive crime and massive tears. Tears. You look at the families that have been so badly hurt. Republicans want strong borders. We want to finish the wall. We're up to $3.2 billion. We've done a lot of work on the wall. A lot of people don't understand that. But that's OK. Got to finish the wall.
We'll get that approved. We're going to get it approved. Just move it along. I'd like to do it. I could do that whole thing in one year, but these guys are holding back. The only thing Democrats are good for is obstruction and resisting. Their whole campaign is resist, resist. I don't get it.
We're going to have no crime. We want to protect America's great people and its great citizens. We want to protect American benefits, and we're doing that, and I've done it. In Maryland, the Democrat candidate for governor wants to give illegal aliens free college tuition, courtesy of the American taxpayer. [Audience Boos]
Come on in, free college. In Florida, the Democrat nominee for governor wants to abolish ICE and release hundreds of criminals onto our streets. He wants to also take care of their Medicare and every other thing you can take care of. You name it, he wants to take care of it. And Florida will be a disaster. Florida is one of the most successful states in our union. It will be a disaster.
You have a great candidate in Florida. It's called the Republican candidate, Ron DeSantis. Ron for governor. This election is a choice between Democrats who want to abolish ICE and Republicans who want to abolish MS-13. It's very simple.
People have no idea how bad they are. Nancy Pelosi got extremely angry at me when she started yelling. "They're human beings, don't talk to them like that. Don't call them animals."
Remember, she said don't call them animals. Then you see what they do and how they do it and the viciousness of it. No, I'm sorry, Nancy. I'm very sorry. Hate to tell you, Nancy. You're going up the wrong tree, Nancy. Republicans stand proudly with the brave men and women of ICE, with Border Patrol, and with our law enforcement.
Every single day, ICE is tracking down drug dealers, child predators, gang members, and vicious killers, and we're either throwing them the hell in jail or getting them the hell out of our country, and we're doing it fast.
This election is about safety. This election is about jobs. It's safety and it's jobs. Thanks to Republican leadership, our economy is booming like never before in our history. Think of it, in our history. Nobody knew this was going to happen.
If I would have said this on the campaign trail, if I would have used 4.2%, you saw it was adjusted upward from 4.1%, 4.2% GDP, the press would have gone after me, they would have said impossible. Jobless claims just fell to a 50-year low. Fifty years. We've created over 4 million new jobs since the election and lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Think of that.
Not only is it good for them, our country saves a tremendous amount of money. But it's good for them. They have jobs.
We've added over 400,000 new manufacturing jobs that the Democrats say are gone and that number is going to very shortly, with what's happening in certain areas, be well over 600,000 manufacturing jobs.
Something that makes me very happy, it makes a lot of my friends very happy, African-American unemployment recently achieved the lowest -- think of this -- the lowest -- lowest ever recorded in the history of our country.
Remember I said, what do you have to lose? Go with me. What do you have to lose? So good. We're going to have a tremendous African-American support, because they say and they see -- you know, before I said what do you have to lose, now I say, see? Look what's going on. The lowest unemployment in the history of our country. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have also reached their lowest rates in the history of our country. History.
Youth unemployment has just reached its lowest rate in nearly half a century. Unemployment for Americans -- this is so important -- without a high school diploma has reached the lowest level ever recorded. Think of that. Women's unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in nearly 65 years. We've added 100,000 jobs building pipelines and supporting the production of oil and natural gas. We've added something great to our portfolio by increasing exports of clean, beautiful coal by over 60 percent. Sixty percent.
And Montana knows something about coal. Think of that. Over 60 percent. We've freed it up. It's a great natural resource for us. Clean -- I call it clean, beautiful coal. What they can do with coal today. In the first eight months of 2018, Montana coal production increased by 2.5 million tons. That's a lot. That's a lot.
Right? To continue this incredible momentum, we need to elect more Republicans like Matt Rosendale. You've got to do it. Because it can be turned off -- it can be turned off so quickly.
Last week, we made another truly historic announcement. We're replacing NAFTA with a beautiful new brand, because it's a much different deal. It will be called the U.S.-Mexico trade deal.
One on one. And hopefully Canada will come into that deal, and if they don't, that will be fine, and if they do, that will be fine. Either way, we can live. We'll be very happy. I think they will, because we love Canada. We do love Canada. They've treated us pretty badly in trade for the last 40 years, but that's OK, it wasn't my fault. We're going to make a fair deal with Canada, just like we did with Mexico.
We're cracking down on unfair trade practices emanating from China. America is tired of getting ripped off. We're going to get a great deal for our farmers and ranchers and factory workers. We're giving our workers and businesses a level playing field. Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and, very importantly, tax reforms.
The average Montana family of four will take home $2,281 extra this year, and many will take home much more than that. And our tax cut saves family farms and ranchers and small businesses from unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax.
So now you leave -- ah, have a beautiful farm, husband, a wife, and you love your kids. By the way, if you don't love your kids, don't leave it to them. Don't worry about it. Then this won't help too much.
But you want to leave it to your kids. You'd like your kids to take over the farm. But you couldn't do it, because they had to borrow a fortune in order to work it out. We got rid of that tax. That's a big deal. It's a big, big deal.
So you can leave your small business or your farm or your ranch and they won't have to go into a big bank and say, gee, gee-whiz, wouldn't it be great if we could borrow some money? By the way, Dodd-Frank, little thing, I fixed it. Dodd-Frank has been changed.
We're canceling Obama's illegal anti-coal so-called clean power plan. Sounds so beautiful. Right? You know what that means. You know, when I did it, I said, man, this is a tough one. It sounds so nice, clean power plan. There's only one problem. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. It will put our country out of business. It took away our greatest natural resources. We couldn't do anything with them. It was such a pretty term. Clean power plan is out of business now. We're going to have clean power, but it's not going to be under the clean power plan. And we're strongly protecting our public lands for hunters and fishermen and everyone who loves the outdoors, like my son, Don, who comes here a lot.
My son comes here a lot. You know that. A lot of you know my son Don. He comes here. He loves hunting. We passed veterans choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor if he has to wait on line for the rest of his life.
And we also passed the landmark V.A. Accountability Act. They've been trying to pass both of them for more than 45 years. I got them both passed.
And with accountability now if a bad government worker abuses one of our great veterans, and we love our veterans, we turn to them and we say, you're fired, folks.
We secured a record $700 billion for our military this year and $716 billion next year for our military. And at my direction, the Pentagon is working hard to create a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force.
So important. So -- people don't know. I mean, we're not just talking about going up to the Moon, going up to Mars. We're talking about, you need it. Now you need it. You look at Russia. You look at China and you look at what's going on, what they're doing. We need -- we'll be the best in the world very shortly in space. I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran deal, and I also recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
Big deal. That was a big deal. And the embassy is already built. It's built about 20 years ahead of budget and schedule. I would say we're probably about 20 years -- you know that story, I'm not going to tell it -- but we built it real fast. We have the best location.
They're all looking for a location. And a friend of mine, the ambassador to Israel, said, oh, but we already have the best piece of land in all of Israel. Best piece of land in Jerusalem. And we have a building on it. Let's renovate it. So instead of spending $1.2 billion, we spent $400,000. That was a sale.
And instead of opening it in 10 to 20 or 30 years or maybe never, we opened it about four months later. It's been open for a long time already. A lot of people working there.
So we have the embassy already open. Do I get credit for saving a billion bucks? Not really. Someday. Someday. You know, when Abraham Lincoln made the Gettysburg Address speech, the great speech, do you know he was ridiculed? He was ridiculed.
He took the horse and carriage up from the White House, he wrote it partially in that carriage and partially at a desk in the Lincoln Bedroom, which is incredible, by the way, in the White House. And he went up to Gettysburg, and he delivered that speech, the Gettysburg Address. And he was excoriated by the fake news. They had fake news then. He was excoriated.
They said it was a terrible, terrible speech. They said it was far too short. It's not long. Many of us know it by memory. It was far too short, and it was far too flowery. It was too flowery, four score and seven years ago, right? Too flowery. And he died. Fifty years after his death, they said it may have been the greatest speech ever made in America.
Pretty good. Pretty good. I have a feeling that's going to happen with us. In different ways, that's going to happen with us.
For years, you watched as your leaders apologized to other countries for America. They apologized. We're so sorry. We're so sorry. So sorry. Now you have a president who's standing up for our country and standing up for you. Look at the size of that guy. Look. Look at this guy. Do I like him? Wow.
We're not going to mess with him tonight, I tell you. Thank you man. That's great. That's really great. Thank you very much. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Montana. And we're standing up for our national anthem and our flag.
But if Democrats get back into power, they will try to reverse all of our incredible gains, gains like nobody thought possible. So this November, you need to get your friends, get your family, get your coworkers, and get out and vote Republican. Get out and vote for Matt Rosendale. He's going to be a great senator, and he'll always vote for what we want. He will always vote for America first, to make America great again. Matt will always be voting for us. It won't just be talk.
Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. Sometimes not so easily, but it's happening, and it's happening fast. We're returning power back to where it belongs, back to the American people.
Our American ancestors braved the oceans, tamed the wilderness, won a revolution, and fought to victory in two world wars. We defeated fascism, triumphed over communism, and we delivered millions into freedom. Our ancestors built the railroads, linked the highways, and they proudly planted an American flag on the face of the moon, which is not shown in that movie.
They did not show that in the movie. See, what they're missing is that that movie would have been a much bigger success if they planted the flag like they were supposed to. We stand on the shoulders of generations of American patriots who knew how to work, knew how to fight, and knew how to win.
Just like them, we're going to keep on fighting, and we're going to keep on winning. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never, ever back down, and we will always fight on to victory. We're going to have victory. Got to keep it going. Because we are America. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue.
We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation, under God. And together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again -- it already happened -- we will make America safe again, and above all, we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Montana. Thank you.
Wow, this is great. Look, snow. I didn't know what was going on. This is -- I said, you sure this is indoor? That beautiful snow looks so real. That's the end of my suit. That's the end of the hair for tonight. That's OK. I love Mississippi, and I love being with you in Mississippi. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you. It's a beautiful place. This is a big -- this is a big, beautiful arena, and they have thousands of people outside, and this place is packed. There's nothing like a Trump rally. Do we agree? Nothing like a Trump rally. I'm thrilled to be here with the great people of Mississippi. You are the men and women that make America truly great, and thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Tomorrow we need the people of Mississippi to go to the polls and elect Cindy Hyde-Smith so that we can continue doing what we're doing, which is, frankly, unprecedented. What's happening is unprenticed. Look, what's the simple two words? It's called America first. America first. It's about time.
It's about time. Under Republican leadership, America is winning again, America is respected again. We are respected like at no time before. And I can tell you, I'm meeting constantly with foreign leaders, and they walk in, and they say, Mr. President, it's incredible what's happened with your country in such a short period of time.
America is respected again. We've unleashed the greatest economic comeback in American history. More Americans are working today than ever before. Think of that. Today, right now, more Americans are working in our country than at any time before. So that's a big thing. That's a big thing. We've created 4.5 million new jobs, and we've lifted 4.3 million Americans off of food stamps.
The unemployment rate just hit the lowest level in more than 50 years. And here in Mississippi, the unemployment rate has hit its lowest level of all time. Congratulations, Mississippi. African-American unemployment has reached the lowest rate ever recorded. African-American youth unemployment has reached the lowest rate ever recorded.
And African-American poverty is at an all-time low. Remember what I used to say, what the hell do you have to lose, right? Well, we produced. And we're going to continue to produce. Republicans passed a massive tax cut for Mississippi families. We eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And America is now the number-one producer of energy on the planet Earth.
Not even close. And that took place pretty quickly, didn't it? We are taking care of our veterans, and our military will soon be more powerful than it has ever been before. And because of that incredible power, hopefully we will never have to use it, right? But to protect these amazing achievements, Mississippi must defend our Senate Republican majority.
You know, we had a fantastic evening and day very recently, the midterms. We got very little credit from the fake news media. Very little credit. They talked about the House, but the people I campaigned for in the House, which was very few, I can't -- look, I'm one person. But the people I campaigned, like in Kentucky, Andy Barr, and so many others, they won.
But the people I campaigned for, generally governor of Georgia, governor of Florida, governor of Ohio, Tennessee, senator, great new senator from Tennessee. Indiana, North Dakota, Missouri, Florida, and many, many others. We got very little credit. But we actually -- if we win tomorrow, we go 53-47. And nobody can believe it. Fifty-three to forty-seven, they're not happy.
The fake news is not happy about those numbers. But that really does -- that gives us very much of a breather. And for those of you that study politics, when the sitting president picks up a seat, let alone like we've done, that's considered a big deal, for whatever reason. For whatever reason. But I used to say, I think that's going to happen.
And I have to tell you, we had three seats, even four seats that were so close, we almost won in areas that a lot of people say don't bother contesting. We almost won in four states that a lot of people said don't bother, you can't win. I said, let's give it a shot. And I'll tell you, a little -- a little tricky business going on. But let's give them the benefit of a doubt, right?
If you let Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, and Chuck Schumer... ... win the Mississippi Senate seat, they will try to erase all of our gains, reverse all of our progress, and impose -- you know this -- they want to impose their extreme job-killing agenda. And I just said, you just set your all-time record in Mississippi for jobs.
It can disappear quickly with the wrong leadership. We don't want that to happen. So if you want more jobs, less crime, strong borders -- how are we doing on the borders? Then you only have one choice tomorrow: You must vote Republican. We are honored tonight to be joined by several really terrific Mississippi Republican leaders.
And we'll start with a friend of mine, he has been so incredible. Seven months ago, he took me around to see things, and then he showed me something that he's maybe the most proud of all of, the African American Museum. Phil Bryant put his guts and his life and his blood into it. Number one, it's doing fantastically.
But number two, I loved it, and he did a fantastic job. He is a great governor, Governor Phil Bryant. Where is Phil? Come here, Phil. Come here, Phil. Come on up here, Phil. We have to get him up here, right? Great governor.
Thank you so much. Are we having a great night tonight? Are we proud to have Donald J. Trump in the house? You are here, he is here to help elect Cindy Hyde-Smith and make America great again. God bless you, Mississippi. Thank you, Mr. President.
Thanks, Phil. Thank you, Phil. Great job. Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves. Lieutenant Governor, where is our lieutenant governor? Where is he? Where is he? Thank you, Tate. A man who's been spectacular, the job he's done. Everyone's talking about it, U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst. Mike? Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike.
A very good friend of mine, he's always there, he's always available, and he is very smart. He loves the people of Mississippi. He loves the people of our country, Senator Roger Wicker. Roger? Thank you, Roger. Great job. And a man that did so well recently, it will go down for a long time, you're going to be seeing those words.
They were beautiful words. And they were needed very desperately at that time. Brett Kavanaugh was being treated very unfairly, very, very unfairly. And Lindsey Graham got up, and he hit a chord that you hit very rarely in the world of politics or anything else. He said things that were said not only so well, the meaning of what he said really changed the course of that event, and now we have a great, great Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Lindsey Graham.
Lindsey, thank you, Lindsey. Thank you. Thank you, Lindsey. He really did. That was very special. We're all here tonight to support an amazing leader and a tremendous champion for this great state, a woman who went to Washington. She's been there for now a short period of time as your senator, but she is respected by all.
And some long-term senators, they've been down there, they told me this is a woman that gets it. She's smart, she's tough, and she loves you. Cindy Hyde-Smith, we have to get her in. Cindy. Come up, Cindy. Come up. Cindy is working every day to rebuild our military, to fix our trade deals, and to deliver for our workers and our farmers and the families of Mississippi.
She produces like few produce. This is a very, very special person. Come, Cindy. Cindy defied the Democrat smear machine -- and that's what it was -- by proudly voting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And her vote was so important. And we just want to thank Cindy Hyde-Smith. You've got to go out tomorrow and vote.
We need her. We need her badly. Thank you, Cindy.
Thank you, Mr. President. I tell you, isn't it great to have the president of the United States here in Mississippi? What a great crowd we have tonight for you. I'll tell you, you know, in the beginning, I said, this campaign, this election, it's not about me. It's about the people of Mississippi. It's about what you believe in and what you care about: Lower taxes, less regulations, supporting our military, supporting our veterans, supporting our law enforcement, protecting the life of the unborn.
That's it. It is about standing firm on the Second Amendment rights all day long. You know, I think that I have given you one reason why I can ask for your vote tonight. That's because I have worked very hard for you, and you can count on me when it comes to your conservative values. You know, other than being the wife to Michael and the mother to Anna-Michael Smith, this is the highest honor of my earthly life, as serving as your U.S. senator.
And I want you to know, I have so much gratitude for Governor Phil Bryant for appointing me. Thank you, Governor. But tomorrow is very important. It is so much at stake. It is such a critical election tomorrow. We have got to go out. What's on the ballot tomorrow is not just my name, Cindy Hyde-Smith. It is your conservative values.
That's what's on the ballot tomorrow. I asked every Mississippian, please contact everybody. Contact... [Audience cheers] Thank you. Contact your friends, your relatives, your coworkers. Remind everybody tomorrow's Election Day, folks. We've got to get out and vote tomorrow. Thank you for this opportunity.
And I want to continue to serve you as your United States senator. Thank you so much, Mississippi.
Get out tomorrow and vote for Cindy. She'll never let you down. The future of the American judicial system is at the center of tomorrow's election. So important. It's a choice between judges who follow the rule of law and judges who follow the radical resistance. That's what it is. Obstructionists. Cindy's opponent, Mike Espy, opposed Brett Kavanaugh.
He's not had a great career, folks. Check it out. Democrats want activist judges who will rewrite our laws, undermine our democracy, and substitute their own far-left politics for the plane and very beautiful meaning of our Constitution. That's what they want to do. A vote for Espy is a vote for the Democrat agenda of socialism and open borders.
Espy supported one of the largest tax increases, you know this, in American history. He cosponsored legislation providing late-term abortion on demand. And he sponsored legislation to provide free government health care to illegal aliens at your expense. Congratulations. Congratulations, Mississippi. Mississippi deserves a senator who shares your values and will fight for your values, and that senator is Cindy Hyde-Smith.
Now, also at stake in tomorrow's election are your Medicare benefits. That's a big deal. Democrats want to raid Medicare to find socialism. It won't last long. Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and, by the way, who have paid for it, just in case we forget. And Republicans will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Democrats will also destroy your health care by inviting caravan after caravan after caravan of illegal aliens... ... to violate our borders, overwhelming our communities, and bankrupting our treasury. You look at what's happening on our border and you see people coming up by the thousands. And frankly, if we didn't show them strength and a strong border -- and nobody's shown a stronger border -- if we didn't do that, you would have hundreds of thousands of people pouring into our country.
We are doing a job, and we will continue to do a job. We're doing what's right. [Audience chants Build that wall] So the wall has started, very, very substantially. In fact, you saw the other day the wall stopped everybody and it was only the section that's now under construction. They breached it, but only momentarily.
It didn't take long. Momentarily. That was called a very momentary breach. I'll tell you what, how good is our border enforcement, ICE, our border patrols, our local police, and our military doing? And you see what our military has already done to existing walls. They made them very unfriendly looking, wouldn't you say?
Climbing those walls would be a very painful experience right now. Republicans are committed to halting this incursion and defending the sovereign borders of the United States. We are sending a simple message to the lawless caravans and to the illegal trespassers marching forward our border. It's very simple, turn back now, go back home.
We will not let you in. We are not going to let you in. Turn back now. Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers, including African-American workers. People don't realize what happens. My administration will always put the citizens of our country first. The policies of open borders are a threat to every community.
Since I took office, ICE agents have arrested over 235,000 aliens with criminal records. Can you believe that, 235,000? That's a lot. And by the way, they want to get rid of ICE, can you believe it? These are tough, strong, brilliant people that also happen to love our country. And I don't want that job, and you don't want it. And you don't want it. And you don't want it. And you might take it right there.
He might -- this guy, I think you could qualify. Including those charged or convicted of more than 100,000 assaults and nearly 4,000 murders. And we're getting MS-13 out. We're taking them out by the thousands and shipping them the hell out of here. We're getting them out. In the state of Texas alone, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety, between 2011 and 2018, more than 663,000 crimes were committed by illegal immigrants.
You know, you hear these stories about, oh, they don't commit crimes. We commit crimes, they don't commit crimes. Always it's us. No, no, it doesn't work that way. It's fake news. It's fake news. Just recently, an illegal alien released by a sanctuary city in New Jersey was charged with a triple homicide in another state.
In just one operation alone, our ICE officers arrested 355 MS-13 gang members on Long Island and in the New York City area. Of those, nearly half were present in the country because they took advantage of the Democrat-backed loophole granting entry to unaccompanied alien minors. Welcome to the United States.
Yet Democrats want to abolish ICE. They want to turn America into one giant sanctuary city for violent criminals and MS-13 and other gang killers. No, thank you. No, thank you. No, thank you. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding citizens, not criminal aliens. Every single day, we are finding the illegal alien gang members and predators and we are either throwing them the hell out of here, putting them in jail, or just plain getting them out of our country as nicely as possible.
Tomorrow's election is about safety, and tomorrow's election is about prosperity. For decades, Washington politicians allowed foreign countries to plunder our jobs, shutter our factories, and decimate our industries. I've been talking about it for 20 years. When I was in the private sector -- I can't believe I'm not in the private sector.
Now they call me a politician. I'm a politician. I can't stand it. They said he's a political person. But I've only had one race, and look at the result. Here we are. And we're only going to have one more race, and hopefully that result will be even better, because we produced. Trillions of dollars were ripped from our nation and redistributed all across the globe.
We've distributed money, and we've distributed our wealth. It's been ripped away from us. It's been taken and given to China and given to Japan and given to South Korea and given to South America and given to everybody all over the world. It's been given to everybody but us. We racked up $4.5 trillion in trade deficits with China since they entered the WTO.
That's the World Trade Organization, which other than NAFTA is probably the worst trade deal any country has ever entered, and we entered it, and that's what built China into the power, but now we're the big power. We're far more powerful. And that's the way we're going to keep it. We had an annual trade deficit... [Audience Chants USA] We had an annual trade deficit -- listen to this.
Who made these deals? Who made them? Almost $800 billion a year we lose on trade. We're stopping that. We're turning that. We just made a great new deal with Canada, with Mexico. But of course, they have to treat us fairly. Otherwise we'll just tax their product when it comes in. You know that. You know that.
You know that. You know what I'm talking about. Entire nations were rebuilt at the expense of America's middle class and, frankly, at the expense of America's business. This massive transfer of wealth represented the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Greatest jobs theft. And you know what?
I don't blame China. And I don't blame these other countries. I blame the leaders of the United States that allowed this to happen. Why shouldn't the other countries try and make these great deals that they've made? I told President Xi, I mean, it's over, I said it's over, but I don't blame you. I don't blame you at all.
I wish we had people that did the same thing in reverse, but we didn't have those people, unfortunately. Here in Mississippi, you lost 4 out of 10 manufacturing jobs in the last 20 years alone. But those days are over. That's why you're doing so well now, and you do have a great, great governor, I have to say that.
America's economic surrender ended the day that I took the oath of office. It ended. And you know what? It really was. Through stupidity, it was an economic surrender. Economic surrender. Why we allowed it to happen, how we allowed it to happen, why these politicians didn't do their job, it's a disgrace.
So we're not going to be taken advantage of anymore. Under my administration, we've created 600,000 brand-new manufacturing jobs that people said could never come back to our country. Right? Remember the previous administration? Remember the previous administration said, oh, manufacturing jobs, that will never happen.
I kept saying, what's he talking about? Manufacturing, we got to make things, right? They said manufacturing jobs would never come back. You'd need a magic wand. Well, we found the magic wand. And they're great jobs. They're high-paying jobs. They're brilliant jobs. They're important jobs. Look at what's happened to our steel industry.
Our steel industry a year ago was dead, and now it's one of the most vibrant anywhere in the world, because we stopped the steel dumping and we put a big tax on -- when they steel dump, they can dump all they want, but they pay 25 percent on everything they dump, and our steel now is doing great. Our industry has come back.
We have steel mills being built all over the country. Nobody saw anything like it ever before. Although 50 years ago, they did well, but for many, many years, nobody's seen anything like it. Last month alone, we added more than 1,000 manufacturing jobs each and every day last month. We're cracking down on countries that cheat and placing tariffs on countries that unfairly subsidized their goods and dump them into our markets like they were doing with steel.
They can dump all they want. I want them to dump a lot. But, you know, number one, what they dump isn't very good, in terms of making high-quality steel. When you need structural steel and other kinds of great steel, you don't want to buy that dumped crap. You want quality stuff. But we're making a lot of money.
We're making a lot of money. They're paying -- they're paying a lot. They want to dump, it's OK. Dump all you want. You're going to pay a lot. That money is flowing right into our treasury, and so are the jobs. Jobs, jobs. We've never saw anything like it. The steel industry, we're very proud of it. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.
It's called the USMCA, like the song, YMCA, right? The USMCA is a tremendous victory for Mississippi farmers, manufacturers, and autoworkers. Tremendous. It's a tremendous deal for us. And you know, one of the things in that deal, you're not going to have companies moving to Mexico and Canada. I told them, that's one thing we can't do. Not going to happen under that deal.
No incentive to move, none, whatsoever. After years of rebuilding foreign countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, and we are doing it with American aluminum and we are doing it with American steel. We have taken bold action to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. Drug prices are starting to come down.
Drug companies, a number of months ago, were going to raise their prices. I actually called up the heads of Pfizer and Novartis and others. I said you can't do that. You can't raise your prices. And you know what they did? They brought them down, they didn't raise them. And that's when I realized being the president of the United States is a very powerful position.
Of course, I guarantee any other president wouldn't be calling up the drug companies and telling them not to raise their price. And right here in Mississippi, we have opened up new affordable health care plans that are almost 60 percent cheaper than the disaster known as Obamacare. And to help critically ill patients get life-saving treatments, we passed something that I'm very proud of. It's called right to try.
Right to try. Hopefully nobody in this room is going to need it for a long time, but right to try is we have the greatest medicines and doctors in the world, and we never let anybody touch it until it was approved. And it would take many years to get it approved. And these people in many cases are terminally ill.
And what we did is we made it possible for them to have it. You know -- you all know friends, if they had no money, they'd stay home. There was no hope. If they had money, they would go to Asia, they'd go to South America, they'd go to Europe looking for something. We have some incredible drugs and potential cures in the pipeline.
Now they sign a quick paper and they have the right to try. And we've had unbelievable success with some of these drugs. It sounds simple, but years and years they've tried to pass it, and they never got it passed. We also passed veterans choice, giving our great veterans the right to see a private doctor instead of waiting in line for two weeks, four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks, forever.
And the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our great veterans will be accountable. We'll look at them and we'll say, get the hell out of here, you're fired, get out. These are a lot of the things we've passed. We could go on. I mean, I have a list, literally, that's four pages long.
But I don't want to bore you. We'd just go point after point after point. This has never happened. Nobody has ever done so much in the first two years of a presidency as this administration. Nobody. Nobody. We also just secured $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military, and we gave our great warriors their largest pay raise in more than 10 years.
And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces. It's called the Space Force. Very important. Very, very important. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal, which was a disaster. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
Together, we've made unbelievable progress and we are just getting started. But we need every last Republican vote in the U.S. Senate. We need 53. We want to get to that 53 number. They don't believe it, but they don't want to talk about it, but that's OK. We have to get 53-47. That will be a wonderful, wonderful day.
So tomorrow is a big day. Tomorrow is a big day. Only with a strong Senate GOP majority can we defend your tax cuts, defend your Second Amendment, protect your Medicare and Social Security, and confirm judges who will interpret the Constitution exactly as written. With your support, we will fight every day to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, pass Kate's laws, end sanctuary cities, end chain migration, cancel the ridiculous visa lottery, and keep the criminal drug dealers and terrorists the hell out of our country.
We will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. For years and years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and proud of America. We are standing up for your values.
We are standing up for Mississippi. We are proudly standing up for our great national anthem. So I am asking every citizen from every party, community, background, race, color, creed, religion, for your support tomorrow, Cindy Hyde-Smith. I need the great people of Mississippi to send a message to cryin' Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, the radical Democrats, by electing Cindy.
We want Cindy tomorrow. This is the greatest political movement in the history of our country. It is. It is. I say it often, they never even challenge me. They hate like hell not to. They challenge things, they challenge everything, every word you say. But this is the greatest political movement in the history of our country.
There's nothing like this. Nothing like this has ever happened. And you still have deep state, but one by one, we're getting them out. You have deep state bad people. You have a lot of phony stuff going on. But you know what? One by one, we're winning. We're winning, winning, winning. Now, there's never been a movement like this.
It's a movement about making government work for the people and answer to the people. It's about reclaiming America's dignity and reawakening America's pride. It's about building a brighter future for every man, woman and child all across this magnificent land. It's about respecting our country. And it's about coming together as one united American family.
We stand on the shoulders of courageous American patriots who secured our independence, linked the railroads, built the highways, dug out the great Panama Canal, went to world wars, put satellites into space, and landed an American astronaut on the face of the moon, and today landed a rocket on Mars. Our ancestors defeated fascism, vanquished communism, delivered millions into freedom, and built the single greatest country and the most powerful military in the history of the world.
We are Americans, and there is no mountain we can't climb, no obstacle we can't reach, and no dream we cannot achieve. Generations of brave Americans did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our very proud American heritage.
For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win, win. [Audience chants Win] We will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender.
And we will always fight on to victory. We are one people and one nation and one glorious American destiny. We all share the same home. We all share the same heart. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same almighty God. And together with the incredible people of Mississippi, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.
Thank you, Mississippi. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Missouri. You are incredible, incredible people. Wow. And we never said to Rush he's got eight minutes. Rush can have two hours, three hours. There's nobody like him. There never has been anybody like him. I was speaking to Sean Hannity backstage. Do we love Sean, by the way? And Sean said, there is nobody like this man.
And he's a real good guy. Although he's tough, he's tough. But, boy, I'll tell you what, when he's on your side, there's nobody you want better. I mean, it's really great. It's really great when he's with you. The biggest of all time at what he does. I also want to thank my good friend, Lee Greenwood. How about Lee?
So we were in Tennessee last night, and Lee was there, and I get that. But this was a surprise tonight. But, you know, that song is one of the great songs, but when he's singing to you like direct, we really like that song, right? We really -- and we like Lee Greenwood, and he's been with us from the beginning.
He has been with us absolutely from the beginning. And while we're talking about incredible people, let's get it over with, right? So I have a few people that are right out here, and they're very special. They've done an incredible job for us. They've been with us from the beginning, also. I'm going to start by saying Sean Hannity, come on up. Sean Hannity.
By the way, all those people in the back are fake news. Mr. President, I did an opening monologue today, and I had no idea you were going to invite me up here. And the one thing that has made and defined your presidency more than anything else: Promises made, promises kept. Four-and-a-half million new American jobs, 4.3 million Americans off food stamps, 4 million Americans out of poverty.
And we're not dropping cash loads and cargo planes of cash to Iranian mullahs that chant death to America. Mr. President, thank you.
And we don't mean at all to insult -- look at the size of the media back there. That's a lot of people. And you do have, honestly, I see some -- you have some very fine people back there. But you have some that aren't so fine. But we don't -- we don't want to insult, but I have to do this, also, because there's a woman on Saturday night that treats us very, very well.
And she does it with love and with passion for the country, not for me. It's not a passion for me. It's a passion for the country. And I really believe it's a passion for you, because we've -- we've together formed the single greatest political movement in the history of our country. She understands that.
And she's understood it from day one, and she did this little show, and she was just going to do it, a little fun, and then it became this tremendous success, and she has got viewership like you wouldn't believe, and she speaks from the heart. Her opening monologue is always exciting. It's always exciting, and it's always brilliant, and she's my friend, and she's your friend. Justice Jeanine.
Thank you. Do you like the fact that we are now in the longest, strongest economic growth streak in American history? Do you like the fact that this man is the tip of the spear, who goes out there every day and fights for us? If you like the America that he is making now, you've got to make sure you get out there tomorrow, if you haven't voted yet.
Everyone you know, your grandmother, your cousin, your kids, even your next-door neighbor if you don't like them, get them out to vote for Donald Trump and all -- not the -- all the people who are running for the Republican Party.
We've got to have them be very careful with those stairs, because she just did a great job, but we don't want her to fall going down those stairs, because they will be decimated. Jeanine has been a great, great friend to all of us. You know that. Also, we have some terrific people that have been with us, and they've worked for us, and they've taken the slings, the arrows, and they are so strong, so tough, so smart.
I just want to introduce somebody, and I said today twice, in Ohio, where we had a crowd like this, and outside there were thousands and thousands of people. And then we went to Indiana, where we had a crowd like this, and there were thousands and thousands of people outside. And I just want to say, there's something happening out there, folks.
There's something happening. Now, you don't know -- and I'm not on the ticket, although they want to put me on the ticket -- I will say this, if we don't do so well tomorrow, they will put me on the ticket. If we do great tomorrow, they will say he had nothing to do with it, he was not on the ticket. But that's OK. We're all getting used to each other.
Does that look like the Academy Awards back there? Look how many people there are. Look how many, the Academy Awards. That's the Academy Awards. And you know, the bad thing, we can have these massive crowds, and this is my third one today this way. You know, that's not supposed to happen. That's not. Somebody said it's not humanly possible.
I said, I guess it is. But, you know, these events, they say you do one a month and then you recover, and then you do another. But you don't do three in one day. These have been incredible. And yesterday, we were in Georgia. We had the biggest crowd you've ever seen, working for the man who hopefully will become the next governor of Georgia.
He's a great, great person, and I think he's going to do very well. They had a lot of celebrities going out there, but the celebrities drew flies. They just drew flies. They didn't have much of a draw. But he's going to be fantastic. But I want to introduce a person who, from day one, she was just smart.
Even though she's my daughter... She was just smart. Nah, don't worry. I'm smart, also. And we're smart. Hey, you know, while I'm at it, don't you love it when they talk about the elites, right? The elites. Come on, honey. When they talk about the elites, I want to tell you, this is the elites. Ivanka, say a few words. Come on, honey.
Hi, Missouri. We love you. We love you. So much love. And we are fighting for you every single day. This president, this administration is fighting so that all Americans can achieve the American dream, and that's what's happening. The economy is roaring. And tomorrow is about ensuring that it stays that way.
So, really, thank you for being out here. Thank you for your passion. Thank you for your energy. It's just an amazing honor. We love you.
Be careful with those stairs, everybody. Be careful with those stairs. You know, they talk about the elites. The elites. Well, I know all the elites. They're not very smart in many cases. They have a lot of hatred in their heart. I don't know about you, but many of you went to better schools than they did.
We did better in the schools than they did. We have better houses, homes, boats. We do better than they do. We work harder than they do. We make more money than they do. Why are they called the elites? But let's let them be called the elites, because you, we are the super elites. We are the super elites.
We are doing well. We are doing well. There's some people out there. But you know, I said just before Sean had me on, and I said, you know what's going to bring us together? This incredible success. I think it's going to eventually -- we have to get the election over with, but I think at some point, they're going to say, OK, it's time.
We give in. We give in. Let's all get together. At some point, at some point, that's going to happen. But being a negotiator, I have to follow it up with this. And if it doesn't, that's OK, too. So, three people that have helped us so incredibly, very special women that have been unbelievable from day one.
I'd like to bring up Sarah Huckabee Sanders... That's pretty good. She's fantastic. That's beautiful. Beautiful. Wow, that's pretty good. How about letting her do the first part of my speech? Good idea? Also, Kellyanne Conway. And a woman who was involved very early on, we had the great state of Michigan.
It hadn't been won in many, many years by a Republican. It was said to be unwinnable. I was told, don't even contend for Michigan. And then I met a woman who had a lot of drive and a lot of energy, and she said, I'd love to run Michigan. I said, I heard it was unattainable. She said they love you in Michigan and they want their car industry back, because their industry was taken to Mexico and Canada and other places, and you don't like that.
And you don't like that. No, I don't. And by the way, it's all coming back, folks. You see what's happening. It's all coming back. It's all coming back. And she worked so hard. And that beautiful evening in November, when they started counting the ballots, and we won Florida, and we won South Carolina, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.
And then -- and we did win Indiana, that's for sure. And we won Ohio, remember? Remember, they used to say, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio. We won Ohio very easily. And Bob Paduchik, who ran that campaign, is here. We love Ohio. Those are incredible people. But what happened was a surprise, because in the midst of all, they said, and Donald Trump has just won the state of -- before Michigan -- Wisconsin.
And every go, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Right? They said, whoa, what's this? What's this? That one was -- I mean, not -- where did that come from? But we've done a great job, and they're great people. And we opened it up for the dairy farmers in Wisconsin. We opened up Canada with our new deal for the first time.
They like us. Great deal. But then they said -- and we're running a string -- and this is when they started getting extremely nervous. And a very nice guy named John King for CNN, you know, he has the board, the red board, and his hand is like starting to shake... ... because that board had so much red on it, they've never seen anything like it. They didn't know what was happening.
Right? That board was red. That board was red. I remember when North Carolina, great state, incredible people, incredible, and the opponent, let's be nice, the opponent said very strongly in the -- that that is their firewall, they cannot lose that. They have it made. Except for one problem, Donald Trump won the state of North Carolina.
Won the state. But then out of the blue, out of the blue, they said, oh, oh, oh, you know, there were some crying, you know? These people are very fair. They're crying, OK? And they're not crying out of happiness, that I could understand. They're crying out of despair. But then out of the blue, they were saying to themselves, we've got a problem here, because Donald Trump has just won the great state of Michigan.
And that was the ballgame, folks. That was the ballgame. Wisconsin, Michigan, it was -- it was in a great -- was that one of the greatest evenings of all time? And, you know, that was every network, every cable station, everything, everybody, look at them all back there, oh, they're loving this, they're loving this.
Every once in a while -- don't worry, I'm not going to mention CNN's name -- but we're not going to watch it. I won't mention NBC or ABC or CBS. Not going to mention. I'm not. I'm not going to mention that you treat us very unfairly. But I think they're getting tired of it. You know why? Because we keep winning.
It's driving them crazy. It's driving them crazy. [Audience chants USA] So, anyway, you're right. USA, nothing like it. Made in the USA. That's happening. They're all moving back, folks. Those companies are all moving back. So this young woman was incredible. And I said, you know, that woman that did such a good job for all of us in Michigan, I think we have to move her to Washington, D.C., to run the Republican National Committee.
And she's been -- she's been there ever since, and she has done a fantastic job, Ronna McDaniel. Come up, Ronna. And she actually is very good on television, too. Just say a couple of quick...
You guys already heard it. The president was in Michigan the night before we won in 2016. He's in Missouri tonight. You need to deliver a win.
Thank you, folks. That's great. Great job. Great job. What a group. I always said that women are smarter than men. Sorry, men. But we understand it, right? Men, do we understand it? No, these are great people. They're great people. And they're our friends, and they work hard for us. And they could be doing other things, but they love what they're doing.
They love what we're accomplishing. And tomorrow, the people of Missouri are going to send Josh Hawley to the United States Senate to keep America's economic boom going full speed ahead. In less than two years' time, we have accomplished more than anyone could have ever imagined. We are so far ahead of schedule.
If I ever said what we've done along the campaign trail, they would have never, ever let it happen. They would have gone out and said, he's exaggerating. Except for one problem. We've done far more than we ever said we could do. And America's extraordinary comeback is the envy of the entire world. The whole world is talking about -- we're the hottest nation in the world.
We're the hottest. And I have great respect for China and President Xi. He's a friend of mine, although he doesn't like me as much lately, but that's OK. He will be back. But -- he said he'll have to get over it. Only a person from Missouri could say that. Who said that? No, we're doing well, and we're doing well with everything, frankly.
But I will say, we have to get out tomorrow, and we have to elect a Republican Congress. We have to do it. We've got to stop cryin' Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi from erasing everything that we've gained. Our economy is setting records on a daily basis. There is no place I would rather be for the last stop of this campaign than right here in Missouri with the incredible men and women who make our country run.
This is my last stop. [Audience chants four more years] Thank you. Thank you. You know, we're changing the slogan. It's make America great again, greatest slogan of all time. Greatest slogan. But you know what? We can't use it for the second four, right? Because it's like they'd say, well, I thought you were going to make it great?
What are you doing using it again? So our new slogan will be in another year keep America great. Keep America great. That's true. Because the wrong people follow us in office, it could all be gone. All of those 401(k)s, where your wife or your husband thinks you're a super genius, a great financial genius, because you're up 51 percent, you're up 62 percent, you're up 42 percent.
My husband's a genius, but for their whole marriage of 20 years, she was screaming at him, cursing at him, saying you don't know what the hell you're doing. Now, all of a sudden, he's a genius. You're looking very good. You're looking very good. But I have to say, so this is my last stop, right? I told you, left Ohio, left Georgia yesterday, left all these great states, Montana, big sky, big sky.
We left all of these great states. We covered a lot of territory. My last stop is here. I think for one reason, for one reason, and I have to say it, because this is the home of Rush Limbaugh. And David Limbaugh, David, thank you, David. Thank you, David. Great lawyer. I hear David is a great lawyer, right, David?
David told me. No, but Sean told me. Everybody tells me. Thank you, David. But this is the home of Rush, and what he did today was fantastic. Because he doesn't do that. He doesn't do that. This is his home. He loves Missouri. And it's very important. Also, this is the place that Josh is running. Josh is a young, incredible guy with tremendous talent.
He will serve this country so well. He will represent Missouri so well. And he's actually leading. He's actually leading. He's actually leading. For decades, Washington only served the powerful and the well-connected. Those days are over. Together, we are the voice for every citizen who has ever been overlooked, abandoned, neglected, ignored.
You remember the words, the deplorables. Oh, that was a good speech. I don't know. Did the speechwriter for the deplorables speech, did that person get fired immediately or the following week? Wow, did he give us a great gift. But the deplorables are the greatest people on Earth. They're the smartest. Is there a doctor in the house, please?
Doctor? Doctor, please, thank you. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, take your time. We have plenty of time, right? Thank you, Doctor. Take your time, Doctor. Thank you. That's fine. Take your time. Don't rush it. That's one of our great people right there. Take your time. Say a little prayer.
Go ahead. Say a little prayer. That's good. That's good. Say a little prayer. Take your time. Take your time. Relax. Take your time. Thank you. We've got plenty of time, right? [Audience signs "Amazing Grace"] That was really something. I want to just thank everybody for the way you behaved. That was beautiful.
And that at the end was beautiful. Amazing grace. Thank you very much. That was beautiful. Hopefully she'll be OK. Hopefully she'll be ok. I want to just say that tomorrow's so important. Josh Hawley is an amazing fighter. We need to keep this jobs boom going. We need to keep our country going the way it is. You saw what was announced on Friday.
Friday was incredible. It was incredible. The jobs numbers, last month alone, we added 250,000 brand-new jobs. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level in more than 50 years. We've created 4.5 million new jobs since Election Day, and we have lifted 4.3 million Americans off of food stamps. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels in history.
We have brought African American and Hispanic American poverty levels to their lowest point ever recorded. There has never been a better time for the American worker. We passed a massive tax cut for Missouri workers and for the United States, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.
And to protect your rights and your freedoms, we overcame the Democrat smear campaign and confirmed the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And you saw what happened on Friday, also. We had great jobs numbers, but we also had something else. The accuser of Brett Kavanaugh, a man who is a fine man, the accuser admitted she never met him, she never saw him, he never touched her, talked to her, he had nothing to do with her, she made up the story, it was false accusations, it was a scam, it was fake, it was all fake.
And you know, when that came about, people were calling for him to immediately get out. Think of that. Think if he would have done that, and then we found out that it was all false accusations. False statements. A made-up story. And let's look at the rest of them, please. Let's look at the rest of them. Because that man suffered.
You know, when I decided it was going to be him, and it was early, because honestly for 10 years I've been hearing about a man named Judge Brett Kavanaugh -- I've been hearing about him for a long time, and they all said he's fantastic, intellectually, he's a great scholar, and he will someday be on the Supreme Court.
Now, that was 10 years ago. Can you believe it? And little did I think I'd be the one appointing him. But I'll never forget, Rush. I'll never forget this, Rush. I brought him to the White House. And I said, Judge, then judge, now justice. I said, Judge Kavanaugh, I want to congratulate you. I'm choosing you to serve on the United States Supreme Court.
And he said, this is the greatest honor of my life. I would like to thank you, Mr. President. And I said, Judge, by the way, just so you know, this is going to go so quick, this is going to be so easy. You have led such an incredible, exemplary life. It's going to go so fast. No problem. And then it began.
And then it began. And he hung in there, and I hung in there, too, by the way. I hung in there, too. False accusations. False accusations. They want to ruin a man or a woman. Ruin a man. And it was headed up all by the Democrats, all by the Democrats, right? All by the Democrats. Dianne Feinstein, with did you leak.
Our great, great, brave, brave soldier from Vietnam, except he never saw Vietnam. Da Nang Dick, you know, Da Nang. He's from Da Nang. We charged up the hill, soldiers were falling left and right, but I was protecting them, I was there. Except he never saw Vietnam. And then he gets up and he says, we demand honesty.
We demand the truth. Can you believe this? This can only happen to us. This can only happen to us. In any event, we energized the Republican Party with that. The Democrats overplayed their hand, just as they overplayed their hand with a lot of things. They overplayed their -- like the Russia nonsense. Russia.
Russia did it. It was Russia. They used it as an excuse by the Democrats for losing an election that they should have won because they have a big advantage in the Electoral College. Remember they used to say, there is no way for Donald Trump to get 270. And they were right. We got to 306. They were right.
We got 306. They used that as an excuse. And they always overplay their hand. Got some bad people. And you have some good people over there, too, I have to be honest, but you got some bad people. The contrast in this election could not be more clear. Democrats produce mobs. That's what's happened. Republicans produce jobs.
We are proudly joined by many terrific Missouri Republicans, including tonight your great governor, done a fantastic job, Mike Parson. Mike? And Mrs. Parson. Great job. Great job. Thank you. Thank you. Great job, Mike. And members of Congress, one of them stopped Washington about three weeks ago when he started doing his little auction deal, right?
Billy. Does anybody know Billy Long? I have never heard an auctioneer so good. I've never an auctioneer as good. But he's a great congressman, more importantly. And he loves the people of this state. And he loves your state. Billy Long, Congressman. Billy. Great guy. Did everybody see that, a month ago? He started doing the auction thing.
Everybody -- and these were hardened political people. They've heard it all. And they just stopped in their tracks. They said, what the hell is that? And it was our friend, Billy. It was amazing. And another congressman from Missouri, always there for us, just like Billy, somebody that's been there for the tax cuts, and there for regulation, and there for right to try, right to try.
You know what right to try is, big thing, big deal. It's a big deal. And he was there, along with some really great people in the Republican Party to take care of our vets, to give them choice for the first time in 44 years. They've been trying for 44 years. Congressman Jason Smith, thank you, Jason. If you don't want to be saying the words "Speaker of the House Pelosi" for the next two years... ... get out and vote for Billy and Jason.
They don't really need your vote, but get out and do it anyway because, wow, that would be a story. We don't want to be complacent. We don't want to be -- they are great people, so get out and vote for your congressmen and women. Tomorrow, the people of Missouri are going to elect a truly outstanding new senator.
Josh Hawley will be a tireless champion for the great people of Missouri. He is great on jobs. He is great on cutting taxes. And there is nobody tougher on crime. He shares your values, and he will always support our military, our vets, and our great law enforcement. Josh is running against an extreme liberal Democrat named Claire McCaskill.
She got lucky the last time. She got lucky the last time. She was way down the last time, and somebody running, it didn't look -- it didn't look too good. She got a little bit -- she got a pass. Let's put it that way. She got a pass. It was a sad thing that happened. That whole thing was a sad thing in many ways.
Anyway, she got in. And now Josh is actually up slightly in the polls. Just came out. But she was going down, and then she said, the Democrats are crazy, and I said, that's genius for getting -- I give her credit for that. She's taking a lot of heat, but she'll patch it up over one lunch a day after the election, if she wins.
But I hope that's not going to -- if she doesn't win, then she's going to have long-term trouble. But she said the Democrats are crazy, and then she said, I agree with our president on border security. I agree. All of a sudden, she agrees with me. I'm in office for almost two years. All of a sudden she's agreeing.
Look, folks. Just so you understand, so the election is tomorrow, Tuesday. On Wednesday, she will no longer agree with me on border security. No longer. No longer. A vote for Claire McCaskill is a vote for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and the legendary Maxine Waters. And more important, it's a vote for their horrible socialist agenda.
Claire McCaskill will be a disaster for jobs, for your families, for your state. And again, on Wednesday, she will no longer remember anything she said, and she will never, ever vote for us on the big things where we need her vote, ever. Just like she didn't vote for Judge Kavanaugh, she's not going to vote for us, and that's the way it is. It's very simple.
And while I very much appreciate her great support out of nowhere along the border, it disappears on Wednesday morning. Claire voted against middle-class tax cuts. She voted against Neil Gorsuch. And Claire joined the Democrat mob in voting against Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Claire McCaskill has one of the most open-border voting records in all of Congress.
Claire McCaskill voted no on Kate's law, and she voted no on enhanced vetting for refugees. Let's just let them in. Let them in. Let them in. And Claire voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities. She would rather protect criminal aliens than American citizens, which is why she needs to be voted out of office tomorrow, please.
If you want jobs, and if you want safety, you have only one choice. A young, talented man who's going to -- I tell you, I really believe this, he's going to go down as one of our great senators, Josh Hawley. Josh, come on up, Josh.
Wow. Thank you. Thank you very much. Isn't it incredible to have President Donald Trump in southeast Missouri? You know, Senator Claire McCaskill said that she could give up a few votes in the Bootheel, did you hear that? I'll bet she regrets it now. President Trump won the state of Missouri by 20 points.
How about that? Twenty points. And he has delivered for this state. But, you know, you would think -- you would think with a record like the president's that the career politicians in Washington, D.C., would get the message. But Claire McCaskill sure hasn't. She hasn't heard a word you said in 2016. President Trump has been fighting to put pro-Constitution, pro-America judges on the bench like Brett Kavanaugh.
But Claire McCaskill voted no. President Trump is securing our border, but Claire McCaskill -- Claire McCaskill is sponsoring the most radical open borders bill in the history of the United States Congress. She voted for amnesty. She voted for amnesty. She has called the border wall embarrassing. That's her word.
And she's mocked the president for wanting to have it. Does that represent us? I don't think so. President Trump lowered your taxes, but Claire McCaskill voted no. She's voted to raise your taxes over 200 times and President Trump has fought to roll back regulations on our family farms and family businesses, like the waters of the United States rule.
It's gone because of him. But Claire McCaskill -- Claire McCaskill voted for every far-left environmentalist regulation the Obama administration could dream up. She even voted to keep the waters of the United States rule. But, you know, I have to say, I mean, maybe Senator McCaskill's record shouldn't be such a surprise, because she did say that she thought the reason President Trump got elected was because of the Russians.
That's what she said. She told a journalist that, because of the Russians. What she doesn't realize is, President Trump got elected because of the Missourians. And we're going to re-elect him. You know, the more -- that's right. [Audience chants four more years] You know, the more I listen to Claire McCaskill, the more she reminds me of another career politician that President Trump defeated in 2016. The person -- the person that Claire McCaskill thought should be president.
Do you know who I'm talking about, Hillary Rodham Clinton? Yeah, yeah. Amazing. Amazing. [Audience chants lock her up] Senator McCaskill has spent a lifetime in politics, just like Hillary. Senator McCaskill has made a boatload in federal money, just like Hillary. Senator McCaskill voted for amnesty, just like Hillary.
Senator McCaskill is for open borders, just like Hillary. Senator McCaskill is for activist liberal judges, just like Hillary. Senator McCaskill even has a phony foundation that makes millions of dollars a year and pays nothing in taxes, just like Hillary. Tell you what. Senator McCaskill -- Senator McCaskill said that we all ought to call Hillary Madam President.
Well, tomorrow, tomorrow, we're going to call Senator McCaskill fired. Thank you very much. God bless you.
That's great. So, everybody, get out and vote for Josh Hawley tomorrow. So important. He will be one of the leaders of the Senate in a short period of time. He's a very special person. And he will never, ever let you down. I know that about him. If Democrats gain power on Tuesday, one of their very first projects will be a socialist takeover of American health care.
You know what's happening. And your taxes are going to triple, maybe quadruple. You're not going to be happy. I know you well. The Democrat plan would obliterate Obamacare. It will also -- which is good -- but leave the bad parts behind. It will destroy Medicare. And by the way, did you notice we got rid of the individual mandate in Obamacare, right?
Nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about the individual mandate, most unpopular thing, and it's going to be gone. Soon, Obamacare will be gone. We actually had it. We missed one vote, one vote, one vote. That was a little bit of a surprise to us at 2 o'clock in the morning. One vote.
But we didn't get any Democrat votes. If Claire McCaskill, we would have repealed it and replaced it. But essentially, it's being obliterated anyway, and it's going to be -- you're going to have great, great advantages with health care when you see what we're doing. We want to -- watch, if they win, they will eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than 411,000 Missouri seniors.
Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors, who earned it, and who, by the way, have paid for it. You know that, right? You know that. And Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always. We are protecting patients. The Democrats' plan to destroy health care also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants.
Somehow that doesn't work well in Missouri. It's commonsense people, by the way. Common -- you know it's all about common sense. You know that. They say, are you a conservative? I say, yeah, I'm conservative, but you know what I really -- it's common sense. Most of it's all commonsense, folks. It's common sense.
You know what it's called? It's called we have to do what's right. We have to have borders. Without borders, we don't have a country. We have to do what's right. We can't let foreign nations take advantage of -- you know, they've been taken -- for years and years, taking advantage of us. We can't allow it to happen.
It's not going to happen anymore. We can't protect rich nations, really, really successful rich nations. We protect them, and they don't pay us for the protection, or they pay us a small fraction. It's not fair. And I tell them, sorry, it's not fair, and we're working it out. You're talking about a lot of money.
You're talking about a lot of money. As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws and violate our borders. And they want to sign them up for free welfare, free health care, free education, and most importantly, they want to give them the right to vote. I can't imagine why.
Democrats' immigration policies are extreme, dangerous, reckless, and insane. They support catch-and-release. They want to free criminal aliens. They want no protections for American workers and taxpayers. And they want totally open borders, which means crime will pour into our country. Illegal immigration costs our country more than $100 billion every year, and that's more than the budgets of Missouri, Indiana, and Wisconsin combined.
I mention those places, you know why? Because we have very important races in those places, and we have all these Academy Award-type cameras going back there. We want to win in those places, too. A nation ought to take care of its own citizens first. Nearly 100 percent of the heroin in the United States enters through the southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, the majority of meth, and a substantial portion of deadly fentanyl.
These drugs kill more than 70,000 Americans a year and destroy the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Last year alone, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 127,000 illegal aliens. And they had criminal records, including those charged or convicted of approximately 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes, and 1,800 homicides.
But despite that, the Democrats want to abolish ICE. They want to abolish ICE. They want America to be a giant sanctuary city for gang members and MS-13 killers. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens, right? [Audience chants build the wall]
We will always stand for the heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, and law enforcement. And by the way, I met a lot of your law enforcement back there. You have great law enforcement police in Missouri. They're great people. Among the most underappreciated people in this country, law enforcement, among the most -- dangerous, tough.
It's a tough job, but they are great people, and they love our country. This election is about security, and this election is about prosperity. For years, you watched as we let foreign countries plunder our wealth, shutter our factories, and steal our jobs. No more, Missouri. No more. Not going to happen.
America is respected again. We are respected. We have added half-a-million new manufacturing jobs since the election. Last month alone, we added another 32,000 manufacturing jobs. That's 1,000 new manufacturing jobs every single day. And the previous administrations said it could not be done. And those are among our best jobs.
I recently announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal with an incredible, brand new, U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement that everybody is for. The USMCA is a giant victory for Missouri farmers, factory workers, and dairy producers. And the other thing I did, and I'll just mention, for those of you that love your children -- does anybody love their children in the audience?
For those of you that love your children and you want to leave your small farm or your ranch or anything you have, including a small business, to your children, you now have no death tax to pay. You now have no estate tax to pay. So if you don't love your children or if your children treat you badly, and you have no intention of leaving your farm or your other valuables to your children, because your children are just no good, then just forget what I just said because it's not going to help you.
But if you want to leave them that farm and you pass, and what happens is they go out and they have to borrow and they mortgage it to the hilt. It's called mortgaging the farm. You know, it's an expression. You're going to mortgage the farm. They mortgage the farm to pay the estate taxes or death taxes, as it's called.
They don't have to do that anymore. They don't have to do that anymore. It's gone. That's a big thing. And the Democrats fought us on that one, too, but we got it by. We have taken historic action to bring back American jobs by cracking down on China's abusive trade practices. And we're doing very well. We're doing very well.
We're doing very, very well. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars in taxes from things that are sold to us, and China wants to make a deal, and that's fine with me. After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, and we are doing it with American iron, American aluminum, and American steel.
And thanks to our beautifully placed tariffs and very tough trade policies, America's steel and aluminum mills are roaring back to life like nobody has ever seen. Right here in Missouri, a company named Magnitude 7 Metals -- whoa, whoa, that's good. Well, that I didn't expect. That's nice. You like that company, don't you?
It is reopening an aluminum smelter and creating 450 brand-new jobs. Would never have happened. Every day it's promises made, promises kept. We have also taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. Happening. Happening. Happening. I called up Pfizer. I called up Novartis, and they were great.
They rolled back their prices. That's when I realized how powerful this office is. When you can get the drug companies to roll back their increases back to where they were. And I appreciate the fact that they did it. And we have just offered a new, affordable health care plan in Missouri that 71 percent less than the horrible Obamacare disaster.
And there's more coming. We passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor rather than waiting on line for weeks and months to see a doctor. Forty-four years, they tried to pass that. And I came up with that idea, and I thought it was brilliant. I went back to my people and I said, you know what we'll do? There's no way there are so many people in line, takes months and months.
I said, you know what we're going to do? We're going to have those people get off line, go outside, see a doctor. And we'll pay for the doctor. I said, I'm so smart. I am the most brilliant human being that has ever lived. And I went to my people, and I said, do this. Do it. They said, sir, we've been trying to get it passed for about 44 years.
I said, oh, so it wasn't my idea. But you know what? I'm the only one that got it passed. That's even tougher. That's even tougher. That's even tougher. And we also got passed the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our great veterans will be held accountable. We will look at them and we will say, Jim, you're fired.
Get out of here. Get out. Get out. Get out of here. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military, which had become so depleted. And we buy everything right here in the good, old USA, best -- best -- we make the best ships, the best submarines. We make the best rockets and missiles.
We make the best jet fighters and bombers and tankers. We make the best tanks. We make the best everything. All here. And we gave our great warriors their largest pay raise in more than a decade. And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces called the Space Force.
The Space Force. Very necessary. And I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It was a disaster. And if you haven't noticed, Iran is a much different country right now. But let's see what happens. We have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
Every other president practically going back many years, every other president promised it, and they never had the courage or whatever it is to get it done. And I know why. Because everybody started calling, just like they did me. They'd call and call. When I realized what they were all calling about, I said, tell them I'll call them back in a week.
Now, I was going to sign it in four days. So when I called them back, I said, Mr. King, Mr. Queen, Mr. whatever. I said, listen, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, what is it? Well, we wanted to talk to you about Israel and Jerusalem, but you've already done it. I said, oh, gee, I wish you got to me sooner.
Because the calls were, like, from everybody. So I understand why other presidents didn't do it. But we did it. And it's a big thing. Together we have made extraordinary progress, and we are just getting started. This is the greatest political movement in the history of our country, what you've done. The greatest.
History of our country. Two years ago, we shocked the Washington establishment and stunned the world. The entire world was stunned. We weren't stunned. We knew what was happening. We knew. When we defied the pundits and the critics and rejected the failures of the corrupt status quo and elected a government that finally puts America first.
Every day, every single day since, every day. The failed old ruling class have been trying so hard, oh, so hard. Wouldn't you think they'd like low taxes, strong military, nice borders, good schools, good health care? We'll get it done. Good everything? They don't want that. They want to claw their way back into power.
That's what they want. Because how can they be opposed to the strongest economy we've ever had? How can they be opposed to the greatest unemployment numbers in the history of our country, including for African-Americans, Asians and Hispanic Americans? How can they be opposed? There's got to be something else on their mind.
Oh, I'm going to love that debate when I say we have the strongest economy in history, and the person over there is going to say why they should do better. Why they should do better. This is the same corrupt crew that chipped away your jobs, stole your wealth, and lined their pockets at your expense. You know that's what happened.
Our opponents have been on a relentless campaign to obstruct, resist, demolish, defame, and destroy. Other than that, they're extremely nice. But you can stop them with your votes tomorrow. Got to get out there. Josh. Josh, our movement is America's movement. You are moms and dads, sons and daughters, students and workers, farmers and soldiers.
You follow our laws, give back to our communities, and raise your children to be strong, upstanding citizens. You are loyal and faithful to your country. You love your country. And now, finally, you have a government and you have a president that is loyal and faithful to you. Right? Right? For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America.
Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Missouri. And we are proudly standing up for our great national anthem. I am asking every citizen from every party, every background, every race, color, and creed, to reject the Democrat politics of anger, division, destruction, and to unite behind our proud, noble, and righteous destiny as Americans.
It's what it is. I need you to get your family, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, and go out and vote for Republican Congress, for Republican Senate. Go out and vote Republican tomorrow. This Tuesday -- wait a minute here, this Tuesday in 15 minutes -- we're almost into Tuesday. In fact, go home and sleep.
Get up early and vote. I need the people of Missouri to seize this incredible moment in history by electing the great -- and he will be someday the great Josh Hawley -- as your next senator. Devoted citizen like you -- all citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country and returning power to the American people.
It's what happened. Greatest movement in history. This incredible state was built by tough frontier men and strong pioneer women who braved the wilderness to build a life and home with their own two hands. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families.
They loved their country. And they loved their God. These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud and great American heritage. From the Bootheel of Missouri, to the beautiful, big sky of Montana, from the deserts of Nevada to the everglades of Florida, from the coal mines of West Virginia to the steel mills of Indiana, and for every family in every city and town across our land, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win and not stop winning.
We will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never, ever back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
And together, with love in our hearts and hope in our souls, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Missouri. Thank you.
Thank you, everybody. It is great to be back in the great state of Iowa... [Applause] ... home of the greatest wrestlers in the world, including our friend Dan Gable, some of the great, great wrestlers of the world, right? We love those wrestlers.
It's always terrific to be able to leave that Washington swamp... [Applause] ... and spend time... [Applause] ... with the truly hardworking people. We call them American patriots. Amazing people. [Applause] I want to also extend our congratulations this evening to Karen Handel of Georgia. [Applause] And we can't forget Ralph Norman in South Carolina. He called me and I called him... [Applause]
He said, you know, last night I felt like the forgotten man. But he won, and he won really beautifully. Even though most people, a lot of people didn't show up because they thought he was going to win by so much. It's always dangerous to have those big leads. But he won very easily. And he is a terrific guy.
And I'll tell you what, Karen is going to be really incredible. She's going to be joining some wonderful people and doing some wonderful work including major, major tax cuts and health care and lots of things. [Applause]
Going to be reducing crime and we're securing that Second Amendment. I told you about that. And that looks like it's in good shape with Judge Gorsuch. That looks like it's in good shape. [Applause] I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend, somebody that I've gotten to know very well, Steve Scalise, and everyone... [Booing] ... recovering from the assault. [Booing] Never fails. Never fails. [Audience chants USA] And we love our police. We love our police. [Applause]
So, to Steve we say -- and he's a great guy, was in my office the day before, incredible. We're praying for you. We're pulling for you. You have our absolute support and our deepest admiration. [Applause] And our gratitude goes out tonight as well to the Capitol Police officers who saved so many lives. You know, they ran from the outfield and they were being hit by rifle fire.
They only had handguns. And they were able to get him. It was an amazing show of talent and bravery. [Applause] So, we want to thank all of the police officers who so bravely serve and protect us. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hopefully our nation emerges from this ordeal -- it was an ordeal, terrible -- more unified and more determined than ever before. And I can see it. And we are indeed more unified in our own way than ever before
You just have to take a look at what's happening here. Right? [Applause] If we set aside the cynics and the critics, we have a chance, and it's a great chance. It lies before us to do extraordinary things for our country in the years ahead.
History is written by the dreamers, not the doubters. [Applause] So... [Applause] ... while we are here tonight to celebrate the amazing progress that we've already made, and we have made amazing progress... [Applause] ... we're also here to lay out the next steps in our incredible movement to make America great again.
Everyone gathered in this arena is bound together by common values. You love our country. You obey our laws. You honor our traditions. And you care for your families. And you love your communities. [Applause] All you want is a government that shows you the same respect and loyalty in return. You believe that America must protect and defend its own citizens. With that conviction deep in your hearts, you showed up on Election Day, November 8th, and voted to put America first. [Applause]
About time. It's about time. [Applause] And from the moment I took that solemn oath of office and every single day since, that is exactly what I've done, put America first. [Applause] After years of sending our jobs and our wealth to other countries, we are finally standing up for our country. And you see it happening. You see it happening. You see what's going on.
Jobs are just about the best they've ever been. We've created almost $4 trillion in wealth if you look at your stock values and you look at what's going on with our country. But we've created tremendous wealth. The enthusiasm and spirit on every single index is higher than it's ever been before for our manufacturers and for our companies. [Applause] After spending billions of dollars defending other people's borders, we are finally going to defend our borders. [Applause, Chanting USA]
After decades of rebuilding foreign nations all over the world, we are now rebuilding our nation. [Applause] As of a few months ago, our country has spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, wasted. And the lives, the lives, thousands and thousands and thousands of lives. $6 trillion and thousands of young, beautiful lives.
We started 16 years ago and it's in far worse shape than it was 16 years ago by many times over. So, we spent all of this money, all of these lives. And let me tell you, I came in and took over a very, very difficult hand. But we're going to get it fixed. That's what you put me here for. We're going to get it fixed. [Applause] We'll get it fixed. Shame. It's a shame. And then you look at North Korea -- thank you. Then you look at your -- and I'm praying for you. Thank you very much.
But you look at North Korea, what's going -- look at Otto, beautiful Otto. Went over there a healthy, wonderful boy and you see how he came back. You see how he came back. So, we've been given a bad hand. But we're going to take that bad hand and it'll all be good.
In addition to that, we're going to start taking care of our country. [Applause] The people are the rulers of this country once again. One by one we are keeping the promises we made to the people of Iowa and the people all over our country. We are not going to let the same failed and tired voices in Washington keep us from delivering the change you voted for and the change that you deserve, that you deserve. [Applause]
I do not answer to any donors or financial contributors. I don't care about them. [Applause] I am not beholden to any consultants or any of the very powerful special interests. I don't care about them. I have to do what's right. And if they're right, that's good. [Applause] We will never be intimidated by the dishonest media corporations who will say anything and do anything [Booing] to get people to watch their screens or to get people to buy their failing papers. [Applause] They are failing.
These entrenched forces are fighting only for themselves, and in many cases for their survival. But I'm fighting for you. I'm fighting for you. [Applause] Fighting for your hopes because your hopes are my hopes. I've had a great time in this country. I've had a great run. And it was time to do something. We all saw what was happening. It was time to do something.
Your dreams are my dreams. And your future is what I'm focused on each and every day. We're going to make America great again. Believe me. We're going to make America great again. [Applause] Here are just some of the historic accomplishments we've achieved in just a very short period of time. And I have to just preface it by saying [Audience shouts We Love You] Thank you, darling.
I have to preface it by saying -- you know, I've been watching. They're saying, President Trump has not produced health care. You know, I've been there for five months. [Laughter] If you remember during the Clinton period, they worked for years and years and years. They never got health care. Obama... [Booing] Although after listening to their testimony I fully understand. But President Obama, his whole administration pushing, pushing for Obamacare, which has now failed.
In fact, I was just told by your great governor and ex-governor that your insurance companies have all fled the state of Iowa. Pretty sad, isn't it? Well, they're -- I'll tell you what, they're going from every state. They're leaving all of the states.
Obamacare is a disaster. It's over. And there's nothing to compare what we're doing. I think, I hope -- I hope the Republican Senate -- if we went and got the single greatest health care plan in the history of the world, we would not get one Democrat vote because they're obstructionists. They're obstructionists. [Booing]
We wouldn't get one Democrat... [Applause] If we came to you and said here's your plan. You're going to have the greatest plan in history and you're going to pay nothing, they'd vote against it, folks. [Laughter]
Every, single vote. So, we have a very slim 52 to 48. That means we basically can't lose anybody. And I think and I hope, can't guarantee anything, but I hope we're going to surprise you with a really good plan.
You know, I've been talking about a plan with heart. I said, add some money to it, a plan with heart. But Obamacare is dead. But it is interesting how they say, Donald Trump is not producing health care, not producing. So, we've produced so much -- I don't think any president, it could be somebody, I have to be a little careful because they'll say, he lied. [Laughter] So, few presidents, few -- just have to be a little careful because they'll say, headline: Donald Trump lies to the people of Iowa.
I don't want... [Laughter] But very few have done what we've done when you look at the regulations, when you look at all of -- you know, they were saying, but he didn't pass legislative bills. I think it's 38. And we're going to be talking about them, 38. And if you listen to them... [Applause] Thirty-eight. But, but, but... [Applause] And some of them are really big, having to do with regulation, having to do with lots of different things.
But, we're working really hard on massive tax cuts. It would be, if I get it the way I want it, the largest tax cut in the history of the United States of America. [Applause] Because... right now, we are one of the highest taxed nations in the world. Really on a large-scale basis, we are the highest tax nation in the world. And we're going to get it down really low, OK? Really -- I don't say the lowest because there are a couple that are really down there. But that doesn't mean you want to be there.
But we're going to have one of the lowest taxes from the highest tax. And we're working hard on it. And I think it's going to happen. And I tell you, I think health care's going to happen. And infrastructure's going to happen. You're going to have a lot of exciting things over the next few months. And I look forward to being able to produce it. Let's see what happens. [Applause] And... [Applause] And by the way, if we had even a little Democrat support, just a little like a couple of votes, you'd have everything.
And you could give us a lot of votes and we'd even be willing to change it and move it around and try and make it even better. It's going to have good heart, but even better. But again, they just want to stop. They just want to obstruct. A few votes... [Booing] Seriously. A few votes from the Democrats, it could be so easy and so beautiful and you'd have cooperation.
And their plan isn't working because they thought they were going to win last night in Atlanta. They thought they were going to win. [Applause] And they've been unbelievably nasty, really nasty. And they thought -- they spent close to $30 million on this kid who forgot to live in the community that he was in.
I mean, you know. [Laughter] Look, I'll tell you about the Democrats. I am making it a little bit hard to get their support, but who cares? [Laughter] I'll tell you about the Democrats. They raised a fortune for him. They fought like hell. They said they were going to win. All of the television networks, other than Fox, which really has treated us fairly, by the way. [Applause]
They have. [Applause] But they built these studios, CNN... [Booing] Hey. Their camera just went off. I can't imagine. [Laughter] It's covered live. Their camera just went off. I can't imagine why.
This phony -- this phony NBC television network. [Booing] They actually had one of the people say, you know, it was a little rainy last night. Maybe that was the difference in Karen's race. Can you believe that?
But, but they had these beautiful studios. And if Karen Handel had lost, they would've blamed it on me, which is fine. But if she had lost, they would've been there for weeks talking about this. This would've been the greatest defeat in the history of American politics.
When she won, when they said projected winner is Karen Handel. Then they said, we switch to another program. Right? So... [Laughter] It was so short. They couldn't get out of there fast enough.
And don't forget, this happened in Montana. Right? In Kansas... [Applause] Last night South Carolina with Ralph, who was expected to win and he won. California. So. But it's been -- it's been incredible.
So, we're 5 and 0. We're 5 and 0. And... [Applause] And they thought they were going to win at least like three, right, wouldn't you say? At least three. And it would be a devastating defeat.
The truth us, people love us, all of us. They love us. [Applause] They don't get it. They haven't figured it out yet. You know, they're still trying to figure where all of those voters came from. Those voters came out of the hills. They came -- these are hardworking -- we have the hardest working, the smartest people, the toughest people.
They're very lucky that our people don't protest, believe me. Believe me. [Applause] They're very lucky. [Applause, chanting USA] We have them. We have the smart ones. We have the toughest ones. Great, great Americans.
And Hillary said the deplorables. These are just the opposite, believe me, of the deplorables. These are just the opposite. [Applause] We have a group, Bikers for Trump. You ever seen? They come by the thousands. Oh. [Applause] Oh. My man. Look. How are you?
We have the -- I didn't know you were here. They're here. Now we know we're protected. That's great. Good to have you, man. These are great people. And when I see them, I say, now we're safe. And they like Trump. And I guess we're well into the 90s. What do you think? The 90s, 95s. But we love our people. And they love us. And more importantly, they love our policy. They love what we're doing.
You see what we're doing. You see what we've already done. Homebuilders are starting to build again. We're not confiscating their land with ridiculous rules and regulations that don't make sense. Farmers are able to plow their field. [Applause] If they have a puddle in the middle of their field, a little puddle the size of this, it's considered a lake and you can't touch it.
And if you touch it, bad, bad things happen to you and your family. We got rid of that one too, OK? [Applause] Unemployment is at a 16-year low. And manufacturing is doing phenomenally. And we have companies moving back.
They're coming back, back, back. [Applause] You know, in the state of Michigan, which has just been like an exit pool where car companies have left. I told them, you know what, you want to start leaving, you want to fire all these people? You watch what we're going to be doing. You watch what we're going to be doing. Not going to be too long.
We have the legendary Wall Street genius Wilbur Ross here. He's our secretary of Commerce. [Applause] We have Gary Cohn who's the president of Goldman Sachs. That's somebody. He's the president of Goldman Sachs. He had to pay over $200 million in taxes to take the job, right? So, somebody said, why did you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy? [Laughter]
I said -- no, it's true. And Wilbur's a very rich person in charge of Commerce. I said, because that's the kind of thinking we want. I mean, you know, really. Because they're representing the country. They don't want the money. They're representing the country. [Applause] And they had to give up a lot to take these jobs. They gave up a lot.
When you get the president, this is the president of Goldman Sachs, smart. Having him represent us. He went from massive pay days to peanuts, to little, tiny -- I'm waiting for them to accuse him of wanting that little amount of money. They wanted that.
But these are people that are great, brilliant business minds. And that's what we need. That's what we have to have so the world doesn't take advantage of us. [Applause] We can't have the world taking advantage of us anymore. [Applause] And I love all people, rich or poor. But in those particular positions, I just don't want a poor person. Does that make sense? Does that make sense? If you insist, I'll do it. But I like it better this way, right?
So, we've achieved a historic increase in defense spending. And we've created a new Office of Accountability at the V.A., our veterans, to ensure that our veterans... [Applause] ... get the care that they so richly deserve, our veterans. We've eliminated restrictions on the production of American energy. They wanted to take away our wealth. The world wanted to take away our wealth.
We happened to be lucky. Under our feet we have great wealth. Not only in the form of your kind of wealth, which is beautiful, fertile soil, but also in other locations in the form of energy. They wanted to take that power and that wealth away from us.
And we've ended the war on clean, beautiful coal. And we're putting our miners back to work. [Applause] In fact, you read about it, last week a brand, new coal mine just opened in the state of Pennsylvania, first time in decades, decades. [Applause] We've reversed... [Applause] And 33,000 mining jobs have been added since my inauguration. [Applause]
And again, we're going to have all forms of energy. But coal is something we have a tremendous advantage at. But we're going to have all, whether it's natural gas, whether it's alternative sources. We're going to have everything.
But a power, it's called, it's a power for our electric different plants and for our furnaces. It's a power. We use electric. We use wind. We use solar. We use coal. We use natural gas. We will use nuclear if the right opportunity presents itself.
We're going to be strong for the future. We're going to be strong for the future. I don't want to just hope the wind blows to light up your homes and your factory. [Applause] As the birds fall to the ground. [Laughter] But I like all of them. And that's what we need.
And by the way, we're saving your ethanol industries in the state of Iowa, just like I promised I would do in my campaign. [Applause] And believe me, they are under siege, folks. I don't know if you know it, but they are under siege. We've approved, first day, the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline. First thing. Day one. [Applause] Thirty-eight thousand jobs. And better for the environment, by the way, better. Underground. Better for the environment. And safer.
Can you imagine the executive for Keystone, who a year-and-a-half ago was told it's dead? And they had billions invested. They bought half of the pipe. And somebody walks into his office, probably a consultant that charged him tens of millions of dollars. Sir, the pipeline was just approved.
Now, you know what he's going to do. He said, I did a great job, sir. I'm entitled to millions of dollars in consulting fees. It was just Trump approving the pipeline. We approved it. We approved it. It's good for the country. [Applause] My man.
And by the way, speaking of that, when I'm signing for the XL Pipeline and the Dakota, I said, by the way, who made the pipe? You don't want to know. [Audience chants USA] Donald Trump
Now, in all fairness to them, they bought a lot of their pipe already. So, it's a little hard to say throw that away, we're giving you, you know. But I put a little clause, handwritten. It said, anybody builds a pipeline in the United States will use American steel and fabricate in America. [Applause] No more taking it over on boats. [Applause] Very simple. [Applause]
We signed 39 pieces of legislation. That means going through Congress, folks. Because you know they tell you, these guys, the fake news. They tell you... [Booing] It's fake news, fake. [Booing] Not all of it. Some of it's good. And some of the people are great, actually. But some are real bad and they're really fake.
But if you listen to them, we didn't pass any -- we passed 39 -- I'm not talking about executive orders, which we've signed a lot. I mean, we have really signed a lot. And we've gotten rid of a lot of really bad pieces that were signed by President Obama, believe me. [Applause] But, if you listen to the fake news, they say like, he didn't pass any legislation. Everything's -- that's wrong. Thirty-nine pieces as of today, some of them very important.
Now, my biggest pieces are yet to come. Hopefully taxes. Hopefully health care. Hopefully infrastructure. And when they come, that won't be good enough either. See who it was. [Laughter] But we've also done a record number of resolutions to eliminate the job-killing regulations on our workers, our companies and our farmers. They're gone. They're gone. [Applause] We are ending the federal intrusion into your family farms and your ranches. [Applause]
And we're also working very, very hard to get rid of the death tax so that you can pass your farms onto your children and onto your grandchildren. [Applause] I don't know if we're going to pull that one off, but we're working very hard to do it. Right, Chris? [Applause] This way you can pass your motorcycle on, OK. Forget about the farm. That's not so bad either. I've seen what you -- what you ride. Not so bad.
But we're working on -- I don't know if that one's going to get pulled off, but it should because you should have a right. Why should you be double taxed? You should have a right to pass your farm onto your children and onto your grandchildren. You should have that right. [Applause] Without having them... [Applause]
Without having them going out and borrowing a fortune, not being able to make payments, losing it to the banks. It's not fair. So, we're working hard. Let's see if we pull it off. We're going to try very hard, I can tell you.
I don't know, but we're going to try. [Applause] No longer will the EPA be telling you how to run your business or do your job or live your life. Instead, it will focus on its true mission, clean air and clean, beautiful, crystal water. Nice, beautiful, clean water. That's what we want, right? Right? [Applause] We're also ending the last administration's federal land grab. We believe states, communities and private land owners know best how to manage their own resources. We've made a lot of progress in that, Ryan Zinke.
We want to see local control. That also means we're not going to let foreign bureaucrats plan our economy or tell Americans how to run their country. [Applause] You know what I mean. [Applause] When I campaigned for president, I promised to renegotiate or to leave any deal which fails to serve America's interests. And I'm not going to allow other countries to take advantage of the United States any longer.
And for that reason... [Applause] ... I totally cut off negotiations. I will not do our great, what is it? TPP? Yes? You guys weren't listening about it huh? [Laughter] But for that reason -- and that too.
As you know, I formally announced that the United States will withdraw from the disastrous Paris Climate Accord... [Applause] It's a disaster. It's a disaster. [Applause] And by the way, Trans-Pacific Partnership, we don't even talk about it anymore because that was done early. But Trans-Pacific Partnership, bye-bye. That was another NAFTA catastrophe that we're going to, by the way, renegotiate.
You know I announced I'm going to get rid of NAFTA. And I've always told you -- or either renegotiate or terminate NAFTA. So, I announced that essentially I was going to terminate. But I got a very, very nice call from Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada... [Booing] From the president... [Booing] ... a good guy, of Mexico asking me not to terminate it, could we negotiate? And I'm always willing to negotiate. [Applause]
I'm always willing. So, we'll see. [Applause] We'll see how it ends. [Applause] But it's been very unfair to the United States. All you have to do is look at all the empty buildings, all the empty plants and factories all over the country. NAFTA has been a disaster. So, we're going to either renegotiate it successfully, which would be my first choice. Or we're going to terminate it and that's going to be that. [Applause]
Now, the Paris Agreement, and it's amazing how the people of this country get it because the press covers it so unfairly. The Paris Agreement would've cost America millions of lost jobs and billions and billions of lost dollars, and put us at a permanent economic disadvantage. China doesn't kick in until 2030.
I could tell you stories. I could give you stats. I could go on all day. It's a catastrophe if we would've agreed. And they all say it's nonbinding. Like hell it's nonbinding. When we get sued by everybody because we thought it was nonbinding, then you can tell me it was nonbinding.
I was elected to serve the citizens of Iowa and Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan... [Applause] ... and Wisconsin and Florida and all 50 states and all 320 million American citizens. [Applause, chating USA] By the way, this is a big place. This place.
And you know, I used to say during the campaign, I'm sure it hasn't changed. But we're not even campaigning and look at this crowd. So, you know it's easier during a campaign. The place is packed with thousands of people trying to get in. Look at the size of this place. They'll never show the crowd. [Booing] They'll never show the crowd. They'll never show the crowd.
That's the only good thing about the protesters, which we don't have very much of. I mean, this guy's blowing a whistle, you know. [Laughter] He's the Bernie Sanders guy. [Applause] But, but we don't have -- but when we do have one, the only good thing is the cameras have to go, and they have to go sometimes up into the little corners way up in that arena. Every seat is packed. Look at that. [Applause] Every seat. Every corner is packed of this big, big arena. So, it's an honor.
Wouldn't it be great if they showed -- you know, it's funny, I go home and my wife would say, Melania, who, by the way, has become very popular. [Applause] They're liking her. They're liking her. [Applause] But she'd say, I never saw the crowd, but it sounded like a lot of people. You know, you could tell. You can't imitate the sound of this many people. This is not like 500 people. This is big stuff. You can't imitate that. You know what they don't understand? They get these massive ratings. I hate to give it.
They probably charge a -- I know they charge a fortune. But all those television cameras, all those live ones. And I hate to do this, but they get even better ratings if they show that. And I try and convince them, but that they can't do. They just can't mentally handle that one, so it's whatever. [Applause] But it is, it's such a great crowd. So, to all of those people watching, it's an unbelievable place.
It is a big, beautiful arena and it is packed. [Applause] So, as you may know, there is another absolutely terrible deal from the previous administration. See how nice I am? I say the previous administration as opposed to the Obama administration. [Booing] That I have recently rescinded. Last week I announced that we are canceling the prior administration's completely one-sided deal with the Castro regime in Cuba. [Applause]
Isn't it amazing? Obama can deal with Cuba, kills thousands of people, people in prison, horrible to women, horrible to every -- can deal with Iran. You talk about bad? The gays, the women, the -- bad to everybody, kill, brutal. I deal with anybody, but Donald Trump is a terrible human being. It's unbelievable isn't it? Isn't it unbelievable? [Applause] It's unbelievable.
But America will stand strong against Communist oppression. We will make a much better deal. I mean, the fact is the deal with Cuba's a bad deal. We'll probably make a deal. Or maybe we won't. Maybe we won't. But you know what? If we make a deal, it's going to be a fair deal and a good deal for us. It's not going to be a one-sided giveaway. [Applause] We're also fighting every single day to achieve those fair trade deals for American factories, and your farmers and your ranches.
Heading up our effort to represent America's interest in China will be a man you know very well. I just left an event where I honored him, introduced him to a crowd of people that adore him. To discuss how to create -- I mean, he's been doing this for years in Iowa. He's the longest serving governor in American history. And now he carries the title of Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad. [Applause] He's a fantastic guy.
You know I told the story today. I said, I come here to make a speech. We have a big crowd in Iowa. And Terry would come and say -- at that time he didn't call me Mr. President. He called me Donald. I said, that's OK. I didn't think about. Now if he called me Donald I'd be very angry with him, right? [Laughter] But he said, Donald, could you do me a favor?
Don't say anything bad about China. We do a lot of business with China. I like China a lot. I've known President Xi for a long time. I really like him. And he also, by the way, likes Terry a lot. And just please don't say anything bad about China. Which is hard for me to do. [Laughter] And I wouldn't.
But then when I won and were looking for somebody to represent us with China, which is a very, very powerful country, and we've had a very good relationship with China, in all fairness, and I do like President Xi. I wish we would have a little more help with respect to North Korea from China, but that doesn't seem to be working out. [Applause] But I do like the president a lot.
So, when I was thinking of who am I going to make the ambassador to China, after you know, having a good, retentive mind. I said you know I remember about a year ago when Terry Branstad was saying all of these great things, your governor.
So, I called him up and I said listen, you've been doing this for 24 years. You want to do something else? Like how would you like to be ambassador to China? And I didn't think he'd really do it. [Laughter] It's a long trip. Twenty-one hours? That's a lot of plane time.
But he wants to do what's right for the country. And I said to him tonight, I said, I wasn't sure you were going to do it. He said, when my president calls me to help him with our great country, I do it. That's what he said to me. I thought it was nice. [Applause] Thought it was nice. Right? [Applause]
So, central to that economic agenda is a plan to restore America's crumbling infrastructure. We will rebuild not only America, but we will rebuild rural America. [Applause] In this great national rebuilding, we will follow two simple rules.
We will buy American and we will hire American. [Applause] We want to get our people off of welfare and back to work. [Applause] We also want to preserve our safety net for struggling Americans who truly need help. We want to help them, people who truly need help, right, Chris? We want to help those people. [Applause] But others don't treat us fairly.
That's why I believe the time has come for new immigration rules which say that those seeking admission into our country must be able to support themselves financially and should not use welfare for a period of at least five years. [Applause] And we'll be putting in legislation to that effect very shortly.
Another core principle is that those coming to our country must embrace our values and love our people. [Applause] And yes, we will build the wall. We've already started planning. It will be built. [Applause, chating Build the Wall] We will build the wall. We need it. We need it. We have to stop the drugs from flowing in.
You know, people don't realize, we're already spending a lot of money on design. But I'll give you an idea that nobody has heard about yet. And I'm not sure, but I'm a builder. That's what I love to do. That's probably what I do best. I'm a builder.
And we're thinking of something that's unique. We're talking about the southern border, lots of sun, lots of heat. We're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall so it creates energy and pays for itself. [Applause] And this way, Mexico will have to pay much less money. And that's good, right? Is that good. [Applause] You're the first group I've told that to, a solar wall. Makes sense. Let's see. We're working it out. We'll see. Solar wall, panels, beautiful.
I mean actually think of it. The higher it goes, the more valuable it is. It's like... [Laughter] Pretty good imagination, right? Good? My idea. So, we have a good shot.
That's one of the places that solar really does work, the tremendous sun and heat. It really does work there. So, we'll see what happens with that. That would be great. And I think we could make it look beautiful too. It would really look beautiful. So, that would be nice.
We're also working night and day to restore law and order to our country, law and order. [Applause] You know that. [Applause] We're reversing the last administration's soft on crime policies that helped enable a tragic rise in violent crime. You see what's happening. Look at Chicago. What the hell is going on in Chicago? What's that all about?
We have also issued new directives to protect our police officers and our sheriffs. [Applause] And we'll always stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause] All American children, no matter where they live, have the right to grow up in a safe community. No issue is more central to public safety than the issue of immigration and border security.
After years of lawlessness, the United States is now enforcing our laws, first time in a long time. And protecting our workers, our schools and our families. Since I was elected, illegal border crossings, and this is without the wall.
Before the wall, have decreased by more than 75 percent, a historic and unprecedented achievement. [Applause] So, we're building the wall on the southern border. We've got the greatest security people in the world. I'll tell you, ICE and the Border Patrol folks, these are incredible people.
You know they endorsed me when I ran for president, knowing that if I win they're going to have to work much, much harder. But they love this country, and they want the job done, and they want the job done right. They have to work harder and it's much more dangerous.
The other thing that I have to tell you. You have a gang called MS-13. [Booing] A friend of mine who's a very, very high-level police officer said to me in describing them, they are the equivalent or worse than al-Qaeda. I would say that's a bad statement.
They don't like to shoot people. They like to cut people. They do things that nobody can believe. These are true animals. We are moving them out of the country by the thousands, by the thousands. [Applause] And the people moving them out are guess what, a hell of a lot tougher and meaner than they are. But they're on our side. [Applause] We're getting them out, MS-13.
During my campaign for president, I met with the families of Americans killed by illegal immigrants, many, many families. Including the parents of Sarah Root, a 21-year-old Iowa girl who was killed the day after she graduated from college with a 4.0 GPA.
Do you know what that is? To those of you who don't know, that means solid A's straight across, number one student. Thousands of beautiful American lives like Sarah's have been stolen for the simple reason that our government has refused to enforce already existing laws. The media, these people, like to talk about... [Booing] ... separating families.
But the families they never talk about are the American families separated forever from the ones they love because we don't protect our borders and uphold the immigration laws of the United States. [Applause] These families and the victims have been ignored totally by the media. They were ignored by the consultants. They've been ignored by Washington.
But these Americans were not ignored by me or by you, and we know who they are. [Applause] And they rise now to the highest level. They rise to the highest level. I promise those families the deaths of their loved ones will not have been in vain, and that we will take strong and forceful action to fulfill our sacred duty to save and protect American lives. [Applause] Every single day we are finding these gang members, these drug dealers, thieves, robbers, predators, criminals, killers, horrible killers, and we are throwing them the hell out of our country. [Applause]
And when they're gone, our now very strong borders, especially with the wall, will never allow them back in. [Applause] So, we're doing a lot of things. We're very proud of what we've done. Just as Gorsuch was a big, big deal. Big deal. [Applause] Somebody explained it to be beautifully. They said, when you pick a Supreme Court judge, you want great intellect, you want all of the things. But you also want youth because they'll be there for 40 years.
So, if Judge Gorsuch, who I've gotten to know, who I think is a fantastic human being, aside from being a brilliant, brilliant student and person, and one of the great legal writers that exists in our country, probably in the world, today.
Every time you see a decision written over the next 30 or 40 years, and especially if it's a 5 to 4 decision, like perhaps on Second Amendment or so many other things, you have done something that you can't value. It's so important.
Think of it. For a 30- to 40-year period, potentially, you've influenced this country. And I've always heard long that just about the most important thing you can do. I always say defense. But perhaps outside, because we are going to have a strong military and strong defense and we need it now. [Applause] But I've always heard that the most important thing a president can do is pick a great Supreme Court justice.
So, I've got one. Probably have some more. But it is really important. And think of that. Over years and years those decisions that are so important, values, great values.
So, I'm very, very proud of that pick. He's already been there now for almost two months. And people are saying wow, that is a tremendous person and a tremendous intellect. So, we're all very proud of that pick. And you made it possible. [Applause] So, I began this campaign on June 16th, a couple of days ago two years. It's my birthday on June 14th, Flag Day of all things.
And we came down the escalator, that famous escalator ride. Melania, myself. And the place went nuts. And hopefully because they like me, but I think also they like the policies. I said the truth.
I talked about immigration. I talked about what was happening on the borders. I talked about our military. I talked about the drug problems which are tremendous. Even in Iowa, tremendous problems beyond anything we've ever seen before. I talked about all of it.
And you know what? We were never off center stage in the debates. We stayed -- you know what that means. We were number one all the way through, all the way through. We were number one all the way through because of people like you. Never off center. [Applause] Seventeen people running. I kept looking up and down. I said, boy that's a lot of people.
Some of them very talented. But 17 people running. We were never off center stage in those debates. And that's because of people like yourselves because you agree with me. And we are making such incredible progress. We are making progress like nobody can believe. These people are being driven crazy, crazy. [Applause] I mean, they have phony witch hunts going against me. They have everything going. And you know what? All we do is win, win, win. We won last night. They can't believe it. They're saying what is going on? What is going on? [Applause]
We won last night. And even the worst of them said, that was a big win for Trump. I couldn't believe it actually. Thank you very much, folks. I appreciate it. But we have made a journey together like no other ever in the history of this country. And maybe beyond that. But you look in the history of this country, there's never been anything like this that's happened. We're straightening out through common sense and through a good heart, we're straightening out our country. We're straightening out our country. [Applause]
No matter our beliefs, no matter our party, it's time for us to remember that we are all Americans and that we are in this together. And it would be great if the Republicans and the Democrats could come together and get really, really great legislation passed. [Applause] Some of the geniuses were saying this morning, you know, from the time he announced on June 16th two years ago, they've been hitting the hell out of him.
Hillary took almost all negative ads. The problem was, when people went to vote, they didn't know what she stood for other than she was saying bad things about me. And I almost became like... [Applause] So, from the time I announced, I've been hit, hit, hit. Then from the time I got in, I said oh, this is going to be great. Finally, we can all come together.
They hit me harder, harder, harder. They've now learned, I think, that that doesn't work. [Applause] Five and 0. Five and 0. It doesn't work. [Applause] They need to be positive. They can't continue to be obstructionists. That's all they have going.
So, they should come together. I don't think they will. But I will tell you, it will be a beautiful, beautiful thing if we could get together as two parties that love our country and come up with that great health care, and come up with that great tax deal for our people and tax reform. And infrastructure and so many other great things. [Applause]
Just think about what a unified American nation could achieve. Nobody could even come close to us. And by the way, even if we're not totally unified, nobody's coming close to us here. Don't worry about it. Gleaming new roads and bridges that would inspire awe and wonder all over the world. You know, we used to be the leader in airports. We had the most beautiful airports.
Now we're more like a third world country. LaGuardia, Newark, LAX, Kennedy. They're like third-world airports. Take a look. Take a look. We used to be the leader. Now you go to Saudi Arabia, where I just came back. A monumental, epic trip because I said you cannot continue to fund terrorism. You cannot continue to fund terrorism. [Applause] And the king of Saudi Arabia, who is really become just he's a very special man.
I mean that. He has taken it to heart. And now they're fighting with other countries that have been funding terrorism. And I think we had a huge impact. We will see. But I think we had a tremendous impact.
We cannot let these incredibly rich nations fund radical Islamic terror or terrorism of any kind. We cannot let it happen. Cannot let it happen. [Applause] It was one of the great two days of my life. And I'm sure a lot of you watched it on television. Fifty-four Muslim nations coming together, some immensely powerful, wealthy nations, and every [Inaudible] was unified and [Inaudible] weren't they're trying to get them to be unified and to do the right thing. I think it could have a tremendous impact.
But not only that, I said for me to go I'm only going, we had to negotiate, if you spend billions of dollars, billions, on having things manufactured in our country with our jobs and our workers for your country. And hundreds of billions of dollars was spent and given to American companies who are going to make American products and send those products over to the wealthy countries of the Middle East.
I mean hundreds of billions of dollars. [Applause] And people haven't talked about that. But to me that was very important because we want those jobs. We want those jobs. So, they're making [Inaudible] sorts of things. Hundreds of billions of dollars. And it's going back. And I'm very proud of that. That's something people don't talk about because the real purpose of my being there was to make sure these countries do not fund terror any longer. [Applause] So, I just want to leave Iowa. I said that I'd come back. Oh, I love that you're not -- look. Look at that.
You know I'm going to leave. I don't want to leave either. I don't want to leave either. I don't want to leave either. But I said I would come back. And I made lots of statements to your governor and to your current governor. Kim is going to be a fantastic governor. She's here. [Applause] She's going to be a fantastic governor.
But I said that I was going to come back. I said that I was going to protect your ethanol, for good reason. Only for good reason. And it was a very important to me. I said that I was going to do things for the people of Iowa. And I want to let you know, I've done it for the people of Iowa, but I've really done it for the people of our country.
Our country is getting stronger, it's getting better. We're going to be setting records in so many different ways. We're going to straighten out all of the mess that's happened over the last long period of time where we went into other nations to tell them how to run their country, and we had no idea.
But I just want to thank all of the people that are here tonight. I want to thank the people of Iowa. You are incredible people. I want to thank you for your incredible support. [Applause] And I just want to let you know that God blesses you. And I want to just say you are special in every way. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [Applause]
Wow, that is so beautiful. Thank you. What a great song, too, by the way. Do we like that song? I think so. I think so. I'd like to use it all the time, but it only seems to work well in West Virginia, right? So I am thrilled to be back with all of my friends in the great state of West Virginia. Thank you.
This was a big victory. We won by 42 points. That's pretty big, right? Forty-two points over a Democrat, right, over a Democrat. They didn't do too well.
And the people of West Virginia, they're loyal, they're hard-working, they're true American patriots. Remember that. They are great people. They're my friends. [Audience member calls "We Love You"]
Thank you very much. I love you too -- guy. It's a guy, but I love you, too. You're proud of our country, you're proud of our history.
And unlike the NFL, you always honor and cherish our great American flag. It was just announced by ESPN that rather than defending our anthem, our beautiful, beautiful national anthem, and defending our flag, they've decided that they just won't broadcast when they play. We don't like that. So while the players are kneeling, some of them, not all of them at all, you're all proudly standing for our national anthem. Thank you.
The ESPN thing was terrible, just came out. Under our administration, America is winning again and America is being respected again all over the world. It's America First. This is the greatest economy that we've had in our history, the best.
Our steel mills are back. They're roaring back. We're making steel again. United States Steel announced a massive infusion of cash.
They're opening up seven different plants. Other steel companies all over the country, they're opening up plants. People said steel will never be back. Steel is back.
It's one of the hottest industries in our country because of what we've done with our tariffs. They were dumping steel all over our country. They were destroying our business. They're not dumping so much anymore.
And if they do, they're paying a lot. Our military will soon be stronger than it's ever been before. We're taking care of our amazing veterans. And I know this doesn't matter to you, but we are putting our great coal miners back to work.
Great people, great people, brave people, I don't know how the hell you do that. I'll tell you. You guys have a lot of courage but we love clean, beautiful, West Virginia coal. We love it, right? And you know that's indestructible stuff. In times of war, in times of conflict, you can blow up those windmills. They fall down real quick.
You can blow up those pipelines. They go like this and you're not going to fix them too fast. You can do a lot of things to those solar panels. But you know what? You can't hurt coal.
You can do whatever you want to coal, very important. And we are working now on a military plan that's got to be something very special. So I'm honored tonight to have a friend of mine. He was a Democrat. And I don't want to say because of me, let's say it's because of policy, he decided to become a Republican and he's a great Republican.
And I want to bring him up if I could. Can I bring up your governor? He is the largest, most beautiful man. Governor Big Jim Justice.
OK. I deputized you, did I not? The other thing I know, you as West Virginians are appreciative people. Now just think, we know what this great man right beside me has done for us. Now let me say this: it's time for us to show that appreciation and deliver back.
We have to re-elect our House members and we cannot, whatever we do, to God above, we cannot put Ojeda on this man. But it goes further than that. Patrick Morrisey is a little behind right now. He needs you. He needs all of you. He needs you to go out and be warriors and deputies for him. He can win this, and this man needs him. So I would say God bless this great man. God bless this great country, and thank you for having me.
He's a big man. He's all man, 6 foot 11. I won't talk about the weight. I don't know. I don't know what the weight is. I won't go there, but he is a big man and he's a great man. He's a wonderful friend of mine. That is really nice what he just said about the man that you want to be your next senator.
That's really nice. Thank you very much, Jim. Also, we have your senator, who's a special friend of mine. She's been so helpful to me and so helpful to you, she loves your state, Shelley Moore Capito.
Congressman David McKinley, Alex Mooney, and Evan Jenkins. And Evan, you put up one hell of a fight. Thank you, Evan. Boy, you are something; and your state GOP chairwoman, Melody Potter.
Melody? Thank you. Thank you, Melody. Also with us is a tremendous senator, somebody that's helped us do our agenda, which is Make America Great Again pretty much, and we have a lot of different names. And you see Promises Made, Promises Kept.
They're copying it now, the Democrats. They're copying it now Promises Made, Promises Kept. They're copying it, but what are you going to do? But this is a man that really -- he makes a promise that it's 100% good. He's tremendous and done so much. He's from a place called Colorado, and he's helping to lead our campaign to elect more Senate Republicans like the man we're going to elect in West Virginia, Cory Gardner. Thank you, Cory.
Thank you, Cory, great job, doing a great job. Thank you. Then we're thrilled to be joined by the next House members from West Virginia's third congressional district, a woman that works very hard for you, Carol Miller. Carol? Thanks, Carol.
Finally, it's my great honor to introduce the person that we are here to support tonight, a tremendous gentleman. I got to know him during the campaign. He has got an energy. It took me a little while to figure it out. I have to be honest. And once I got to see what was happening -- and Evan would be the first to tell you too -- he was so tough, he was so smart, he didn't stop.
He does not stop, and he's going to fight for you like nobody's ever fought for the people of West Virginia, your next senator, Patrick Morrisey. Patrick, come up here. Come up here, Patrick. Come up here, Patrick.
Joe does have to go. Let me just be clear. Hey guys, I want to start out by thanking the president for coming back to wild and wonderful West Virginia for the sixth time.
Thank you.
Hey, how about this guy? West Virginia's never seen anything like this. We love you, Mr. President. And I'll tell you this: we know that President Trump is making America great again.
But even more importantly, President Trump is making West Virginia great again. Look, tonight, we're joined by some of the Mountain State's finest coal miners. Can you stand up?A round of applause for our hard-working coal miners. Donald Trump and I are fighting every day for our coal miners and the hard-working men and women of our state.
He's trying to get the man off your back, and I'm working every day to help him do it. [Audience member calls "You're the man, Trump."]
Amen. But I'll tell you what, one of the best ways I can help President Trump is to have you send me to the U.S. Senate, where I'll be a big ally of this president. West Virginia needs to send a conservative fighter to the U.S.
Senate to help drain that swamp. Now ... [Crowd Chants Drain the Swamp]
It's pretty good. Now let me tell you a little bit. I have an opponent in this race. His name is Dishonest Liberal Joe Manchin.
And let me be clear, Liberal Joe is no supporter of this president. Manchin strongly supported and voted for Hillary Clinton after -- right? All right, hang on, hang on -- after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work. Yes, that's pretty bad. Manchin even called Hillary warm, compassionate, engaging, tough.
Can you actually believe that? Let  Joe's got to go. Joe has to go. Liberal Joe no longer has West Virginia values. Let's go through the record.
Manchin was for Obama. Manchin was for Hillary. Manchin is for radical gun control, Planned Parenthood. He shills for EpiPen, and he opposed the Trump tax cuts. Let me be clear -- pretty bad, right? Remember, this is West Virginia.
We benefit as much or more than anyone from the Trump tax cuts. Joe Manchin no longer has West Virginia values, period. When I get to the U.S. Senate, I'm going to be a strong ally of President Trump.
I'm going to be the conservative fighter that you can rely on. We're going to stand up for coal and our energy resources and we're going to tackle this opiate epidemic more aggressively than anyone.
It's my honor to be here tonight and be on the same stage with the president. Mr. President, thank you for your leadership, your work, and for standing up for West Virginia.
Thank you, man. Thank you.
Amen. Together, we're all going help this guy make sure not only that we make West Virginia great again, we continue to make West Virginia great again. Best way to do that? Liberal Joe's got to go. Guys, Joe's got to go.
And now I will turn this back over to the big man who you're here to see. Amen, brother.
He's got energy. He's got a lot of talent and he loves this place. He loves the people and he's going to be fighting for you. He doesn't sleep. He's out campaigning. I said how many days are you campaigning? Because I said the last 60 days of my campaign every single day, we'd go out every single day as many stops as you could make humanly. Humanly, he can't get tired.
He's got that same thing. He's not going to get tired. He's every single day and he's got a very special spark. You see it and you know him.
Look, you know him. He's done a hell of a job as your AG. And you got to get him with us. You got to get him with us.
He's going to bring it back home for the people of West Virginia. So this November, voters in West Virginia will face a very simple choice. A vote for Patrick Morrisey is truly a vote to make America great again. He's going to vote. And I like Joe, but Joe doesn't vote.
He just doesn't vote for us. It's a vote for Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, their new leader Maxine Waters. But between Waters and Pelosi, you have two people that are in charge of Congress. They're not in favor of West Virginia.
They don't know that West Virginia exists. They don't like coal. They don't like energy. [Audience calls We don't like her]
And they don't like her. So when you cast your ballot for Congress in November, you aren't just voting for a candidate. You're voting for which party controls the House and which party controls the Senate, so all these Congress people. And I'll tell you, we have to get there.
We really have to get there. So I'm going to be going out as many days as I can and I'm allowed to. I have sort of a lid with all the Secret Service and all the fantastic people, but it sort of holds you back. Maybe sometimes I'll just make a few trips without them.
We'll do them quietly. But we're going to be out a lot. We're going to a lot of different states, and I'm coming back here before the election. And it's a very close election.
A lot of people don't realize there's a 6-point spread. Six points could be ended by this evening. He could be up by 12. You've seen what's been happening.
We've had a good record of endorsements. In Georgia, a man who was down 10. I endorsed him a short while before the election -- good man, for governor -- and he won 70 to 30. So I guess he picked up 45 or 50 points. In Ohio recently there was -- he was up and then he went down a little bit. We went there, and he won. You know that, Balderson, good man, Congressman Balderson now, he won.
We won eight out of nine special elections. Nobody talks about it. They don't talk about it. Eight out of nine special elections, and they don't want to talk about it.
And my record  and look, I don't want to brag about it, but man, do I have a good record of endorsement. In Florida, we have a great candidate, his name is Ron DeSantis. And he called me and asked whether or not I could endorse him, and I said let me check it out. And he was a 3.
This was a few months ago. He was a 3, and I gave him a nice shot and a nice little tweak, bing-bing, and he went from 3 to like 20-something. And then I gave him my full and total endorsement, and he's now leading by, like, 19 points. And that election is next week, leading in the primary.
He's a good man. And so many others. Staten Island, the Congressman Dan Donovan, he was down before the election. We endorsed him. I think he won by 24 points. So if we can do just -- all my life, I've heard endorsements don't mean anything. They said if you get an endorsement from Ronald Reagan -- we like Ronald Reagan -- it was a wonderful thing to have but it didn't move the needle.
And if you get an endorsement from a lot of people, it never really -- is that a correct statement? If you look, Cory, Shelley, if you get an endorsement, it was nice to have, but it didn't mean anything. These endorsements -- and I'm not saying it from my standpoint. They're going 20, 30, 40, 50 points. Fifty points, it's crazy.
And then you watch the news, will this endorsement mean anything? Let me tell you, it's going to mean a lot. And I mean a lot. And I don't care, I just wanna, we have to get senators in. We've got really no majority. We have -- if you really look at it, probably we could say 49-49, 51-49. We have some people that aren't able to vote. We have some people that are a little unreliable. They don't exactly like what I've done to their career.
They don't love what I've done, and that's OK. And I don't like what they've done either. But we need to elect five, six, or even seven more senators and I think we can do it. I think we can do it, and we have to start with Patrick Morrisey. He's going to be fantastic. If you vote for Joe Manchin or any other Democrat in November, you're voting for the party that wants to really destroy the coal industry. Patrick said it.
Joe endorsed Hillary 100%, and he got along with her even better after she came out with a statement that she wants to destroy coal and coal companies. That's a bad thing. The Democrats want to turn America into one big fat sanctuary city for criminal aliens. And honestly, they're more protective of aliens -- the criminal aliens than they are of the people.
They want to take away your Second Amendment. You see what's going on. I don't think you want your Second Amendment played with. They want to take over American health care and abuse our courts to rewrite our constitution.
And how do you like the judges that I've been appointing? Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch, Supreme Court? There's no worse nightmare for West Virginia this November than Chuck Schumer running the Senate and Nancy Pelosi with Maxine Waters running the House. And that is why you must vote Republican. You gotta get out of the vote. They keep talking about a blue wave.
I don't see it. We have the greatest economy we've ever had. Joe Manchin always voted for Obama, and he voted to keep the disaster known as Obamacare. And I will tell you it is being chipped away.
We had it beaten, but one man, I'm sure nobody knows who I'm talking about, voted no, shockingly. To -- really surprising to a lot of people because he campaigned on repeal and replace -- but we've really knocked it out, including the individual mandate. We got rid of the most unpopular part of Obamacare, where you have the privilege of paying a fortune for not having to pay a fortune for really bad health care. OK, that's not too good. We got rid of it. A lot of people are very happy about that. That came along with the biggest tax cuts in our history.
And Joe Manchin voted no on the tax cuts. The last time I was here, I saw signs along the highway, Joe, you voted no on tax cuts and Joe, you voted no for our president. You voted no. And he's going to vote no.
I'm not knocking him, but Schumer's the boss and he may give us a vote on Justice Kavanaugh. He should. Everybody should. I mean, here's a guy -- is this Central Casting? This is what we want. This is a great, brilliant man.
But Joe's just not voting with us. He's voting against your tax cuts. He voted against repeal and replace. He votes against the things that we want, and he votes against the people of West Virginia. You can't do that.
Joe opposed the wall and he opposed the travel ban. And by the way, the wall right now, that wall is coming along. We're over $3 billion. It's moving along very nicely, very nicely. And if you think it's easy with these people, it's not easy.
It's not easy. We're getting the wall built. It's going up and we're getting it built. And we have a big number in right now. [Crowd chants Build That Wall]
So Shelley and Cory you hear that, right?
Yes.
Yes.
So we have $3.2 billion. We're looking for $5 billion this year, and all of a sudden it's going to be finished and it's going to be very, very effective. You heard about it today with the illegal alien coming in very sadly from Mexico. And you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman.
Should have never happened. Illegally in our country. We've had a huge impact, but the laws are so bad. The immigration laws are such a disgrace.
We're getting them changed, but we have to get more Republicans, we have to get. This election is bigger than any one race. It's about whether we want to continue the amazing progress we've made for America or whether we want to surrender that progress to the forces of extremism and obstruction. Their little phrase that they like, resist, that's all they're good at.
They have no policy. They're not good politicians, but they're good at sticking together and resisting. I have almost 400 people that haven't been approved by their slow-walking. Do you know what's slow-walking? They're slow-walking them. We have almost 400 people in our administration, people that gave up their careers that have been waiting over a year to get approved and they're being slow-walked by the Democrats. It's never happened that way in the history of our country and it is a disgrace. It's a disgrace. The Democrat Party is held hostage by the so-called resistance, left-wing haters and angry mobs.
They're trying to tear down our institutions, disrespect our flag, demean our law enforcement, denigrate our history, and disparage our great country. And we're not going to let it happen. New York's Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo even declared that America was never great. Oh, I see, OK. Tell that to our great soldiers at World War I, World War II, Korean War, so many others.
Tell them to the folks that sent a rocket up to the moon and our great astronauts. Tell them to all of the great medical research we've done in this country and he says America was never great. I would imagine that's career-threatening, right? I would imagine. How do you get away with that one? Did you hear? He was speaking to a room loaded up with socialists and probably others, probably others.
No not communists, but there could have been a couple of them, too. And he made the statement that America was never great and they would go, did you hear? They go, whoa,whoa. They couldn't even believe it. Now that's job-threatening.
His comments are an insult to the generations of brave Americans whose blood and sweat and tears built our magnificent country. So this November, you can either vote for the party that says America was never great -- that's going to be their theme now America was never great. Hey, let's do that. They copied mine, Promises Made, Promises Kept.
Let's give them a new theme, "America Was Never Great." That's the Democrats' new theme. Can we do that? Yes. We'll retheme their party. Or you can vote proudly for everything that we stand for. We're the greatest country in the world and we are now the greatest economy that we have ever had. We're the greatest economy in the world. [Crowd chants USA]
We've gone up $10 trillion in value since my election. We've gone up $10 trillion, think of it, since the election. Was that a great election? Boy. Remember I was here just before the election and I brought a couple of guys into a room and I said, "Fellas, supposing we teach you a new skill, supposing we teach you like how to make little widgets or gidgets or gadgets." These are big, strong coal miners.
They said, "Sir, we want to dig coal." I said, "I agree with you." I agree, right? Remember that? Their grandfathers did it. Their fathers did it. That's incredible and it's really happening. We are back. The coal industry is back.
So when I came here originally, West Virginia, frankly, was down and out. It was not doing exactly well, one of the last. Do you know that a few months ago, it hit where West Virginia on a per capita basis is one of the most successful GDP states in our union? So we went from being down and out. You're one of the most successful in the union, very close to the top.
That is some big change. And I've had so many people, I was backstage and people are coming up to me, "Mr. President, thank you, sir, for saving our nation," because you understand what that means. We couldn't do anything. Had the other side won, they would have poured on more regulations, raised your taxes.
They would have done things that were so bad. You had a very low GDP. It was 1.2%, 1.2%. It was going down. It was going to be a negative. Last quarter, we just hit, as you all know, 4.1%.
Nobody thought that was possible. If -- I always said, if I would have ever said that shortly after winning we're going to hit 4.1%, those people back there would have said, "This guy, no good, fake news, fake news." How fake are they? Fake news and the Russian witch hunt? We got a whole big combination. Where is the collusion? You know, they're still looking for collusion. Where is the collusion? Find some collusion.
We want to find the collusion. At the beating heart of this election is border security. We have to have that, right? We have to have it. Iowa officials and so many other countries have been reporting numbers where they're having a lot of problems with people coming in.
People are coming in, but we're getting them out. We have MS-13 on the run. They poured in here with Obama. We have them on the run because we love the men and women of ICE. A blue wave in November means open borders, which means massive crime. A red wave means safety and strength. That's what it is.
The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. A vote for any Democrat in November is a vote to eliminate immigration enforcement, throw open our borders, and set loose vicious predators and violent criminals. They'll be all over our communities. They will be preying on our communities.
Yet while many Democrats are calling to abolish ICE, today our brave ICE officers successfully carried out a 14-year-old deportation order against a Nazi criminal who is living in New York, the last known Nazi officer living in the United States. They've been trying to get him out for decades. President Obama tried. They all tried.
We got him out, gone.He's gone. He's back in Germany. ICE officers are heroes who uphold our laws and they really do. They uphold our laws and they defend our communities like nobody you've ever seen.
And yes, they're tough, they're strong, they're smart, they have great heart, but they go into these communities loaded up with the kind of criminals you don't want to be dealing with. They walk in like it's another day in the office. They're tougher. They're stronger.
It's what these other people fear. And by the way, our ICE folks and our border patrol folks, they have no fear. The job they do is incredible. And by the way, while we're at it, law enforcement, these are great, great people and they're doing an incredible job, right? Every single day, ICE is tracking down gang members, drug dealers, predators, and killers, and we're either throwing them in jail or throwing them the hell out of our country.
If you want to save ICE, if you want to protect our border and our border patrol, if you want to stop this craziness of sanctuary cities, where criminals are protected -- take a look at Chicago, how about the mayor of Chicago? It's like a war zone. It's a great city. It's like a war zone. This is what those policies do.
Last week, 62 people were shot. Twelve died. This is like our country. There's no reason for this.
The Republican Party stands proudly with our courageous ICE officers and border patrol agents. And by the way, you know who wants the wall more than any of us? ICE and border patrol because they know that's going to be a big, big factor in stopping the drugs from coming in, the human traffickers, which is worse all over the world than at any time in the history of our world, human traffickers. Who would believe, and it's because of the internet. This election is about security and this election is also about jobs.
Wwe have produced. We have produced. Thanks to Republicans, our economy is booming like it has never boomed before. We've created another number that nobody would have believed if I said it during the campaign: 4 million new jobs since the election. Nobody would have believed it.
Almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps, think of that. They don't need them because they have a job. They're eating better now. They don't need food stamps, almost 4 million, think of it.
Last year in West Virginia, per capita income grew 40% faster than the national average, 40% congratulations. Congratulations. I told you last time I was here, you weren't so happy like you are now. We've added over 400,000 new manufacturing jobs nationwide. That number is soon going to exceed 600,000 and our opponent said there's no such thing as manufacturing jobs anymore, right? And I'd say, "Oh I see we're not going to make things any more." Think of it, we'll be close to 600,000 very soon.
We have companies pouring into our country. They're coming back. These are companies that left. They're coming back to Michigan.
They're coming back to West Virginia. They're coming back to Pennsylvania and Ohio. They're coming to Florida. They're coming back, not just opening.
They're coming back. They left and now they're coming back because they want to be where the action is and the action is in the United States of America. So the economic growth, as I said, when it hit 4.1%, everybody was like, "That's amazing," except me, because it's going to go much higher than that. When I finish these trade deals -- and the tariffs are very important -- these companies come in and I say to the European Union, very nice people, I say Jean-Claude, we'd like to negotiate a new trade agreement with the European Union.
We lost $151 billion over the last number of years per year. Does anyone know what a $151 billion per year is? And he very respectfully said, "Mr. President, but we are very happy with the deal." I said, "I'd be happy if I were you too. I'd be very happy." I said a second time, a third time, and a fourth time, but they were happy with the deal but we weren't happy because they have barriers up and because they have tariffs, all the things we don't have. You want to build a car and send it to Europe, how many Chevrolets are there in the middle of Berlin? Not too many, maybe one? I doubt it.
I don't think you could find the one. So there are barriers so I said, "Come on, let's go." And then he said, "No." I said, "Listen." And I said this to numerous countries, I mean, in all fairness, I don't want to single out anybody, but I said it. "Listen, here's what we're going to"  it's all about the cars. It's all about the cars, tremendously big industry. We're going to put a 25% tax on every car that comes from the European Union into the United States and that'll take our loss and trade deficit of $151 billion and it'll give us a surplus of $151 billion. That's a fairly dramatic swing and that'll take one little signature, Donald J.
Trump. And I got a call, "Mr. President, when can we meet? We'd like to see you." And they came, and very respectfully, we're working on a deal. But this is happening all over.
Wth China, I have great respect for President Xi, great respect, tremendous respect for China. But they have taken advantage of our country for decades. We have rebuilt China. We have rebuilt China. I used to talk about this. I didn't press it initially because I wanted them to help us with North Korea and they have, and they have, and we're doing well with North Korea. These guys, it's been what three months since I left? These guys say, "What's happening with North Korea?" Hey folks, they've been doing this stuff for 75 years.
Three months. What happened? I can tell you and I got along very well with Kim Jong-un. Really well. Good chemistry.
Obama was unable to do anything with North Korea and he considered it like -- just read the papers. You'll see what he considered it. So I've been three months. I have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim. We'll see what happens. Who knows? Can I be honest? Who knows? But I haven't taken off the sanctions.
We have massive sanctions, but I want to take them off quickly. But they've gotta get rid of the nukes. They've gotta get rid of the nukes. Gotta get rid of them.
But who knows what's going to happen? I mean, maybe it'll work out, but I think we've done a good job in a short period of time. You remember it started off extremely hostile. Remember they said, "He's going to get us into a war." They thought my rhetoric was too strong. You remember.
I won't say it because I don't want to insult Chairman Kim, but you remember, you remember. Elton John, I don't want to insult-- so I'm not going to mention it. But the fake news back there said, "He is going to get us into a war. He's crazy. This guy is crazy.
Our president is crazy." And then I went to meet the leaders [ph] and the folks that run NATO, all the leaders of NATO and they weren't paying their bills. They were delinquent. In real estate -- I love real estate -- when somebody doesn't pay their rent, you say  Shelley, you say their delinquent. You gotta pay your rent.
And I met him last year and Stoltenberg, secretary general, great guy of NATO. He's my single biggest fan, bigger than any fan I have in the room. You know why? Because nobody was paying their bills. He was in charge of NATO. He couldn't get any money. But last year, I went a year ago, I said you're not paying your bills.
You gotta pay your bills. He picked up $44 billion. He told that to the press, they didn't report it. Forty-four billion.
And then I just left recently and we're going to pick up at least another close to $100 billion extra. I said to him, "You gotta pay your bills." The United States is paying close to 90% of the cost of protecting Europe, and I think that's wonderful. I said to Europe -- I said, "Folks, NATO's better for you than it is for us. Believe me." And what happened is they asked a question.
They have small countries, big countries, all of these countries were  we're supposed to protect them? I said, "Look, it's very simple. You gotta pay up. You gotta pay your bill." And somebody said, "Sir," there's the president of a country calling me sir. That shows respect.
I say, "Yes, Mr. President?" He said, "Would you leave us if we don't pay our bills?" Now they hated my answer I said, "Yes, I would have to consider it. You gotta pay your bill." They hated the answer. But if I said, "No, I won't leave you.
You don't have to pay your bills. I won't leave. I promise, will always protect you. You will always be protected.
Don't pay your bills." Then they're never going to pay their bills. So I said, "Yes, I will leave you if you don't pay your bills" and you could see those checkbooks coming out for billions of dollars. They pay their bills. And I think we'll pick up over the next short while over $100 billion.
And then they said the fake news, they said, "President Trump treated the NATO nation leaders" -- in brackets, I put brackets, who have been ripping us off -- treated the NATO leaders with tremendous contempt and disrespect. And I said, "No no, no. They disrespected our country because they weren't paying." Now they're paying. How about if we got into a conflict because a country was attacked and now we're in World War 3 and we're protecting a country that was attacked and didn't pay its bills? I'd feel so stupid.
We're protecting a country that wasn't paying its bills. So I got them to pay $100 billion. It's gonna be much more than that, but tremendous amounts of money, tremendous. They gotta pay up, they're paying up.
And then they made the statement that I showed great disrespect. But actually, I have a great relationship with all of those people, 28 people, all of them. We have a great relationship because now they respect us. They respect our country again.
They didn't respect our country. They didn't respect our country. They respect us again, and you see it with China. China was walking its way down.
I don't want them to go down, but they're down close to 30% in three months. I don't want that. I want them to do well. I want to be their friend. But we had to do things that we had to do.
When I came, we were heading in a certain direction that was going to allow China to be bigger than us in a very short period of time. That's not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore. Good luck to them.
The long winding road, you know, the long winding road, and I have tremendous respect for China. I mean, the energy, the genius, it's incredible what they've done. And hopefully we're going to have a great relationship, but we can't do it. It's got to be a two-way street. We have only one-way streets, not only China, with everybody. It's a one-way street, our enemies, our friends, our allies. I mean, our allies treat us worse than our enemies. Believe it.
So it's all changing. And when we get those trade deals done properly -- and you know what bothers me? I have people coming to me some people in Congress, "Sir, can you get this deal done immediately?" I say, "It doesn't work that way. I don't want to go too fast. The deal is not going to be any good if we do that.
We gotta take time, it's got to gestate, right?" The word gestate, it's like when you're cooking the chicken, time, time, turkey for Thanksgiving. My mother would say, oh eight hours. I said, "Eight hours?" She made the greatest turkey I've ever had, takes time, takes time. So when they run and they say, "Oh, can you do NATO right now? Could we sign it next week?" I said, "Wait a minute. Look, I like Mexico.
I like the new leader. I think he's going to be terrific, little different than us." I think I'm doing better with him than with the capitalist. But he knows that Mexico needs the United States. They need the United States.
Canada charges us close to 300% tariffs for dairy products going into Canada, which is essentially saying we don't want your dairy products -- this is a wall. They have a wall in a different way. It's called an economic wall. I don't want that. I'd said, "Justin, I mean, I don't want to have too much fun with you, Justin. You can't do that." Justin Trudeau, nice guy, but they've taken advantage of us for so many years that we have to take our time.
But with that being said, we're doing very well. We're on our way with a good deal, a fair deal. I don't want a good deal, I want a fair deal for both of us, fair with Mexico. And you've heard me say it.
As an example, when China makes a car, they sell it into the United States. There's 2 1/2 percent tariff, of which they don't pay. So they paid nothing. Other than that, it's a wonderful deal.
When we make a car, we sell it into China, and there's a 25% tariff. And that's just the beginning, here's others. A man was driving down a street in China and he looked over and it was a Chevrolet, like Camaro, does that make sense? Is it a Camaro? I think it costs $39,000 or $40,000. He's in China. He's in Beijing and he shouts across -- they're stopped -- he then shouts across, "Tell me, how much did that car cost in China?" Guy looks, "$119,000." Now you understand that, right? It's all taxes and taxes and taxes. We can't do that anymore. Can't do it.
We are a country with unbelievable potential. We are a country that has been ripped off by everybody, and we're not going to be ripped off anymore. And if it takes me a little angst to tell senators and congressmen and all of the people that really do have your heart in the hands, in many cases -- sometimes I wonder where they're coming from with these suggestions -- but it's going to have to take that little period of time. With that being said, we're moving so fast, nobody could even believe it.
And every country wants to make a deal because we're like the big fat piggybank that everybody wants to rob, and we're not going to let them rob us anymore. Is that OK, West Virginia? We're not going to let them rob us anymore. Every day we're keeping our promises. We're canceling Obama's illegal anti-coal destroying regulations, the so-called Clean Power Plan. Doesn't that sound nice? Clean power.
You know, when I ended the Paris accord, what's a more beautiful name than the Paris accord? Let's call it the West Virginia accord -- maybe I would have signed it. But when I entered it, that was going to cost us hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions. And other countries, as an example, China didn't kick in until many years in the future. We kicked in immediately. Russia went back many years, which was not a clean time in terms of the environment because you know what? We all agree, we want a clean environment.
We want a strong, beautiful, clean environment. I want clean air. I want crystal clean water, and we've got it. We've got the cleanest country in the planet right now. There's nobody cleaner than us and it's getting better and better.
But I'm getting rid of some of these ridiculous rules and regulations, which are killing our companies, our states, and our jobs. Just today, we announced our new affordable clean energy proposal that will help our coal-fired power plants and save consumers, you, me, everybody, billions and billions of dollars. We've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, and Republicans have passed the biggest tax cuts and reform. The reform is very important.
But you know what I've said, I don't want to talk about reform because nobody knows what it means. That could be a tax increase. I said, "How come it's been Ronald Reagan since you got the last big tax cut?" And they looked at me and said, "We don't know." And a lot of the great senators and the congressmen came up to see me and they had the 2018 tax reform. I said, "What the hell does that mean? Are you going to raise taxes?" Then I found out this is what they've done for 40 years, tax reform. I said, "Nobody knows what it means." And we do have reform in there, great reform. But they said nobody knows -- I said, "Nobody knows what it means.
Here it is. I want to put it down, tax cuts." They said, "What would be your favorite name Mr. President?" I said, "The tax cut, cut, cut, cut bill." And we almost did it. We almost did it but in all fairness in this case congressmen, a couple of them thought it was a little bit tacky. So we call it the Tax Cut and Jobs Bill. But you know what? We have done great reform.
But it's the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and you people are benefiting by it. You're benefiting. And companies are benefiting, and those companies are the ones that are providing all of the jobs. We're setting records on jobs. We're protecting, also so important for West Virginia and a lot of states, we are protecting again religious liberty and we're also standing up to social media censorship. That's the new thing.
That's the new thing. I'd rather have fake news like CNN. I would rather have fake news  it's true -- than have anybody, including liberals, socialists, anything, than have anybody stopped and censored. You gotta live -- we gotta live with it.
We gotta get used to it. We're going to live with fake news. There's too many sources.Every one of us is sort of like a newspaper. You have Twitter, you have whatever you have, Facebook, but everyone, you can't have censorship.
You can't pick one person and say, "Well, we don't like what he's been saying. He's out." So we'll live with fake news. I mean, I hate to say it, but we have no choice because that's by far the better alternative. We can't have people saying censorship because you know what? It can turn it around. It can be them next. It can be them next. We believe in the right of Americans to speak their minds. We repeal the core of Obamacare. I told you, individual mandate -- because we want to give critically ill patients. We have to give them access. We have to give health care to people. We want the right to try. Do you know what the right to try is? They've been trying to get this for 40 years. They couldn't get it.
A person is terminally ill, they're terminally ill. They're really sick. And I know people, if they have money, they travel all over the world to try and find a cure. If they don't have money, they die. They die.
We have the greatest scientists in the world, that's why China and so many other people, they're trying to -- countries they're trying to steal our technology. We can't let them happen. But we have so many people that want to be able to give -- it's like hope, right to try. I love the name. It's a right to try. They never had it before.
So a person is terminally ill and we have a great new drug, but it's going to take another two, three years to have it approved. OK, maybe longer. But the tests are really looking good. And this person is very sick.
And this person is going to be dead in 90 days and we couldn't get that drug for that person no matter who you were. And I said, "Wait a minute what's the story with this?" Now, there were a lot of complications because the insurance companies had problems, the medical companies had  everybody. A lot of people didn't want them in the stats, horrible things. But I said, "Well, what's going on? We're going to take the right to try and we went through with the help of Cory, with the help of your great, wonderful -- you are a coal lover, aren't you, huh, Shelley? But with the help of Shelley, soon to be with the help of Patrick Patrick, Patrick, oh, he's going to get a lot of things.He's going to get it.
We got it approved. So now if we have a great drug that hasn't been approved and somebody has a certain illness they're going to be able to be -- to try. And you know what? Some of the drugs we have in the pipeline are amazing. It's going to work for a lot of people and it's going to give them hope. It's going to give them hope, big deal. We've just secured $6 billion to fight the opioid epidemic. And I know in West Virginia, that's a big deal, right? That's a big deal.We confirmed a record number of Circuit Court judges, it's a record and it's going bigger and bigger.
We have a lot of them in the line if Schumer would ever get them approved. He's not exactly thrilled about approving them, that I can tell you. We confirmed the great deal Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States. And as I just said, Justice Kavanagh is doing great.
Looks like I had a very tough Central Casting. How do you vote against him? But the Democrats may find a way. We've secured a record $700 billion for our military this year and $716 billion for next year, billion with a b. Our military will be stronger and bigger and better and more sophisticated than it's ever been, ever.
And hopefully we'll never have to use it. You don't get a lot of good fighters out here. I see some of them. I know some of them. And the one thing about a fighter or a nation or whatever you want, the stronger your military, the better chance you have of never having to use it.
We don't want to use it. We don't want to use it. And all of that equipment is being built right here in the U.S.A. We make the greatest fighter jets in the world.We make the greatest ships in the world. We make the greatest missiles and rockets. Nobody does it like us.
And in my direction, The Pentagon is working hard to create the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, the space force.That's very exciting. We need it. That's the new frontier, and I'm not just talking about sending rockets to the Moon. I'm talking about militarily.That's where it's at. Thanks to the leadership of U.N.
Ambassador Nikki Haley. We've reduced the United Nations spending by $1.3 billion saving U.S. taxpayers $350 million. Just came out, but nobody wants to ride it.
We just passed the landmark VA accountability law.That's where people that don't treat our vets properly, we look at them and we say, "You're fired. Get the hell out." 45 years they have been trying to pass it. 45 years they've tried the pass it. We also passed veterans choice so that if our veterans can't get the care they need, they have the right to see a private doctor. They don't have to wait in line for three weeks, four weeks, eight weeks, two months.
I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal. And this month, we reimposed tough sanctions on Iran's nuclear program and on Iran.
I also recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And I understand now what happened because every president  many, many presidents. They said, "We're going to do it. We're going to move our embassy to Jerusalem. It's going to be the capital of Israel, and we're going to do it." We're going do it, and then they don't do it. [Inaudible]
Politicians, they don't do it. So I said, I'm going do it during the campaign.I said it right here in West Virginia. And I now understand why many, many presidents before me said they were going to do it and didn't do it because I was inundated with calls from foreign leaders, every country. Don't do it.
Don't do it. Don't do it. Please don't do it, don't do it. And so actually, what I did, I was about five days off.I stopped taking calls.
I said, "I'll call you back next week," because I knew what they were going to ask me. It's much easier if it was, oopsie, I didn't know you're always calling for that reason. So I approved it, and it should have been done years ago. And if there's ever going to be peace, remember I said it, with the Palestinians, it was a good thing to have done because we took it off the table.
Because every time they were peace talks, they never got past Jerusalem becoming the capital. So I said, let's take it off the table. And you know what, in the negotiation, Israel will have to pay a higher price because they want a very big thing, but I took it off the table. They could never get by.You understand that Cory.
You both understand that. Shelley? They could never get past the fact of Jerusalem becoming the capital. Now it's off the table. There's nothing to negotiate.
But they'll get something very good because it's their turn next. Let's see what happens. It's very  I've always heard that's the toughest deal of all deals that's called peace between Israel and the Palestinians. They say that's the toughest of all deals.
Let's see what happens. Instead of apologize, that's -- what we're doing is we're winning. Instead of apologizing from that, we're standing up for America and we're standing up for the heroes who defend our country, but to continue this incredible success, we must elect more Republicans.We must elect Patrick Morrisey. We need him. We need Patrick. So get your friends, your neighbors, your co-workers, your family members, get the people that love our country and get out to vote. We need his vote so badly. We need his energy. You're going to see this guy has energy.
Loyal citizens like you helped to build this country. Together we're taking back our country, returning power to where it belongs, to the American people. From Morgantown to Madison to Charleston, this great state was settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women who tamed the wilderness to build a better life for themselves and for their incredible American families. They didn't have a lot of money.
They didn't have a lot of luxury, but they had grit and they had faith and they loved each other. And I'll tell you what, they were smart. They are smart. We're the smart ones, remember. I say it all the time.You hear the elite. They're not elite, we're elite.
You're smarter than they are, you have more money than they are, you have better jobs than they do, you'rethe elite. So let them have the word elite. You're the super elite.That's what it is. I always hate -- I always hate when they say, well the elite decided not to go to something I'm doing, right, the elite. I said, "Well, I have a lot more money than they do. I have a much better education than they have.I'm smarter than they are. I have many much more beautiful homes than they do. I have a better apartment at the top of Fifth Avenue. Why the hell are they the elite? Tell me.
Because you are the elite. Just remember that. You are the elite. They're not the elite.
That's just a name. Aren't you insulted when they say the elite? To me, I'm insulted, always insulted. They're the elite, they're not the elite. Your people and the people that preceded you in West Virginia were the Carpenters and the coal miners, the ministers, the metal workers, the farmers, the factory workers, but they all had one thing in common.
They love their families, they love their country, and they love their God. We stand on the shoulders of generations of American patriots who knew how to fight and they knew how to win. We're winning again. We're winning again. Just like them we're going to keep on fighting and we're going to keep on winning and we're going to win for our nation, our children, our families and we're going to win for our continued freedom.
I joke that I'll have Patrick Morriseycoming to me soon. He'll be your senator and he'll say, "Mr. President, the people of West Virginia can't stand winning so much. They haven't won in decades and now you're winning with coal, you're winning with everything." He's going say  Patrick, he's going to say, "Mr. President, please they don't want to win so much. They can't stand it. Please you're winning too much for West Virginia. Please stop winning." And I'm going to say, "Patrick.
I'm sorry. I don't care what the hell the people of West Virginia want. We're going to keep on winning anyway, because I believe that's what they want." Right? That's what they want because the people of West Virginia never give up. They never given and they never back down because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue.
We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America wealthy again. That's happening. That's happening a lot faster than the fake news ever said it could happen.
We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, West Virginia. Thank you.
Thank you very much. I've never seen rain in North Carolina. It's raining, but we're going to start. There are a lot of people trying to get in. Should we start or should we wait about an hour? Thank you. Thank you. And thank you to my friends right here. You've been with me from before I started, right?
Thank you very much. Thanks. Hello, North Carolina. Thank you very much. And I'm really glad to be back in Charlotte, with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots. And I can't wait to be back here for the 2020 Republican National Convention. You had a lot of competition. But in the end, we said let's do that North Carolina thing.
Let's do that Charlotte thing. That's where we'll be. So we'll see a lot of you. In just 11 days, the people of this state are going to elect Mark Harris and Ted Budd to the United States Congress. They will be incredible fighters and have been. They've been fighting all their life for great things, and they're fighting for your interests, including lower taxes, strong borders, great health care, protecting pre-existing conditions, and removing job-killing regulations, which we've done more of than any administration ever.
Early voting is now underway. So if anybody wants to leave, we'll save your place. You can come right back. Go out and vote. Otherwise, definitely on November 6th, right? Did you vote yet? Did you vote? Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Well, we really have -- we've had a tremendous all over the country Republicans, we're hot.
We're hot. We're hot. And I don't think they're going to cool us off, no matter what they want to do. They try. They try so hard. But I don't think that's going to happen. Before going any further, I want to briefly address the packages and devices that have been mailed to a number of high-profile individuals.
As you know, the suspect has been captured. Great job. And is now in federal custody. These terrorist actions must be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law. We all know that. And I want to applaud the FBI, the Secret Service, and all state, local, federal officials for their incredible work in this investigation.
I mean, they did an incredible job. This is finding, truly, a needle in a haystack when you think about it. We love our police, and we love our law enforcement. Political violence must never, ever be allowed in America, and I will do everything in my power to stop it. In recent days, we've had a broader conversation about the tone and civility of our national dialogue.
Everyone will benefit if we can end the politics of personal destruction. We must unify as a nation in peace, love, and in harmony. The media has a major role to play. Whether they want to or not. [Audience chants CNN Sucks] And they do, indeed. They have a major role to play as far as tone and as far as everything.
And we all say this in all sincerity, but the media's constant unfair coverage, deep hostility... and negative attacks -- you know that -- only serve to drive people apart and to undermine healthy debate. For example... we have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party.
Yet when a Bernie Sanders supporter tried to murder congressional Republicans and severely wounded -- a great man named Steve Scalise and others -- we did not use that heinous attempt at mass murder for political gain, because that would have been wrong. It would have been the wrong thing to do. Many other examples could be brought up. Nor do we blame the Democrat Party every time radical leftists seized and destroy public property and unleash violence and mayhem.
Yet the media has tried to attack the incredible Americans who support our movement to give power back to the people. It's what our movement is. Our supporters are some of the most honest, wonderful, like you... principled, hard-working, patriotic people on the face of God's Earth. They pay their taxes, follow our laws, care for their neighbors, go to church and contribute to charity, and they are loyal to our country.
All they want is a government that is loyal to them in return. And that's what they are getting from me. And that's what they're getting from my administration. And you know that. But despite all of this, just came out, 94 percent of the press I get is negative. Even when I do something wonderful, it's negative.
Even when we do great things, you look at North Korea, how good are we doing? It's been going with them for 70 years, more than 70 years. This is now our fourth month, and they always say, he's not moving fast enough. Fast enough? If I wasn't here, you would have ended up in a world war. You watch! I mean, you would have ended up in a world war.
Or I heard even on Fox today, Bret Baier, I heard even on Fox we had a great meeting with Vladimir Putin. And every time I see, oh, Donald Trump had a bad meeting -- I had a great meeting. We had great. And they play it up as negative as they can. It was a great meeting. We have all the cards. We have all the cards, because we're the piggy bank that everybody wants to attack and rob and steal from.
We have the cards. But they made it look as negative -- that was a great meeting I had. They make it look -- all of them, as negative as possible. Almost all of them. Or if you take a look at what we're doing with NATO, where for many years they're not paying their bills. Now they're paying their bills and nobody talks about it. I went in last year, and I said, you got to pay up. We're protecting you.
We're protecting you. You got to pay up. They agreed to pay $44 billion more money we don't have to pay ultimately, because it's not fair. Not fair. We're protecting them, and they're not paying their bills. And we want to protect them, but they got to pay their bills. And this year, we had an even better meeting, but you never hear that from these folks.
So it's very important that the media cover results properly. And I could give you -- I could stand up here, I could give you all night long other examples, but these are just a few quick ones. I just heard the one with Russia. I'll tell you what, the worst thing that ever happened to Russia is when I won the election.
That's the worst thing. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And at the same time, getting along with Russia, getting along with China, getting along, frankly, with North Korea and South Korea and Japan and everybody else, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. In the meantime, we will keep delivering results, like nobody else has delivered them for many, many decades for this country.
And it is time for us to replace the politics of anger and destruction with a real debate about the real issues. And we want honest coverage from the media. That's all we want. This is one of the most important elections of our lifetime. Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, and America is winning because we are putting America first.
[Audience chants USA] So true. We're putting America first. When have you heard that last? Been a long time, hasn't it? I said the other day, I'm not a globalist. I'm a nationalist. And they say, oh, that's so terrible. They said that's so terrible. Oh. I'm for us. And you know what? We're going to help the globe.
But we have to help ourselves, as well. I want to help the globe, but we have to take care of ourselves, also. So unfair, what's been happening to our country for 25 years and longer. The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in more than 50 years. We have eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, passed a massive tax cut for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.
We are taking care of our great veterans, and our military will soon be more powerful than it has ever been before. That's true. Our military was in very depleted shape. It was in very shape. They were getting parts for aeroplanes going to the aeroplane graveyard. You know that, right? That's where they store old, old planes.
Not anymore they're not. We've ordered the finest planes in the world, missiles, rockets, every -- ships. Everything we have. We'll be stronger than ever before, and hopefully, you know what, we'll never have to use our military. Wouldn't that be nice? And the best way that'll happen is by doing exactly what I'm doing right now.
We want to be in a position that people say, let's leave them alone. But if Nancy Pelosi... and cryin' Chuck Schumer... Right? Nancy Pelosi... Can you imagine? Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. I don't think so. But if Pelosi and cryin' Chuck Schumer, remember, right? I've known him a long time. He never came close to crying, except one particular night.
When the radical Democrats get control, they will try to erase every single thing that we've achieved. Democrats want to raise your taxes. They want to impose socialism. That's what they're doing. They want to take away your Second Amendment. Take away your strong health care that we're making stronger and stronger every single day.
By the way, nobody talks about, but we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. Where you had the great privilege of paying a fortune in order to pay a fortune to not pay for bad health care. That's not a very good -- right? That's not a very good thing. Now we got rid of the individual mandate.
That's big. And by the way, we've really radically changed that. And we had it beaten. But we didn't get one Democrat. I always say, we didn't get somebody vote, which is true. But we didn't get one Democrat vote, either. Think of it. One Democrat would have repealed and replaced, but we're essentially doing the same thing anyway.
It's been decimated by us. And now, if you notice, your premiums are going up at a much, much lower clip. And yesterday -- and yesterday, which got very, very little print, very little ink by these great gentlemen and ladies... by the fake news... So yesterday -- yesterday, it really did, it was a very important -- we signed a bill -- prescription drug prices are going to come tumbling down.
Tumbling down. You know, we have other countries -- we have other countries that, for the same pill for the same company made in the same plant, wherever the hell it's made... [Laughter] You go and you see that same pill, same box, same everything, selling for 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent of what Americans are forced to pay.
That's all ending, folks. That's all ending, OK? So hopefully you don't need prescription drugs, but if you do, you're going to get them a hell of a lot cheaper, because it's going this way. But the middlemen and the drug companies, but the middleman are not thrilled with me right now. They're not thrilled with me. These were very rich people.
They are not -- they are not thrilled with Donald Trump right now. And the Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens into our country. And they want to sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and for the right to vote. They want to sign 'em for the right to vote.
What's that all about? [Audience chants Build that wall] The right to vote. You ever hear that one? Illegal alien has the right to vote. There's a town in California where they actually tried to take over the town council. All illegal aliens running the town council. That sounds like a great idea. I wish they became so activist in their own countries.
Wouldn't that be good? Wouldn't that be good? Let 'em go take over the councils in their country. Look, I want them to come into our country, but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit, the merit system. We have millions and millions of people right now on line, they've been waiting sometimes 10 years, they did it right, they went through, they did everything, they signed every paper.
They're waiting proudly on line. They're going to be admitted soon and all of that. And it's so unfair to them to have people just walk across a border, because our Democrat laws are no good. Because we have laws that are the laughingstock of the world because of the Democrats. They're the laughingstock of the world.
Catch-and-release, we caught 'em, release 'em. We caught 'em, release 'em. Think of it. Think of -- visa lottery. Visa lottery. Um, who is this? Who is this? And then when they turn out to be not so good, we say, I wonder why. Well, maybe the country is giving us their worst in those lotteries. Does that make sense?
Do you think -- do you think the country is saying, let's get our best people, our greatest people, let's put them in the lottery so that the United States can have them? Or do you think maybe they're going the opposite route? I think maybe the opposite route. Right? Or chain migration. How about that one?
How about that one? Chain migration, where we had this bad guy come in from a certain country, and he brought his mother and his father and his uncle and his grandfather and his grandmother and his brother and his sister and his aunt and his uncle and probably a lot of people that no relation to them whatsoever, I think it was 22 people.
But perhaps they'll be able to figure it out. And he's driving down the West Side Highway, this beautiful park along the West Side Highway in Manhattan that I know very, very well. And he decides to kill people. And so he takes the car going 60 or 70 miles an hour, far above the speed limit, and he turns it right into a park where people are jogging, where people are working out, where people want to look so good.
They leave their apartment to work out, to run, to run along the Hudson River, so beautiful. And he goes 70 miles an hour, boom, and he kills eight. And he badly, badly, badly hurts -- nobody ever talks about -- 12 people, missing arms, missing legs, missing everything. Just so sad. And he brought in 22 people.
This is what we have. Nobody working. He brought in -- that's called chain migration. It's from the Democrats. And we don't want it anymore. Right? A vote for Democrats is a vote for open borders and a vote for tax hikes. I don't know. I don't get that one. I think I would be a failed politician if I had to really promote open borders.
Everybody comes in. Everybody comes in. Come on in. We pay for all of the things we just went over. I couldn't do it as a politician. You know, to be successful in life, you have to believe in what you say. And I can't believe that many of these Democrats that have gone so far left -- I knew them, and when you say the wall -- first of all, we started the wall.
But more importantly, many of these Democrats in -- almost all of them, including Schumer, including crooked Hillary, including everybody... many of these Democrats approved the wall in 2006. [Audience chants Lock her up] Oh, boy. They're going to be reporting about you tonight. [Laughter] They're going to be reporting.
That's pretty cool. That hat is fantastic. That's a hat. Look at that. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safety and for jobs. Remember that. Earlier this month, we achieved yet another historic victory, a victory that people will appreciate over many, many years and maybe decades. We proudly confirmed the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
[Audience chants Kavanaugh] Good, remember that. Remember. Remember when you're going in to vote, remember what you say. Because nobody has ever been treated more unfairly than Brett Kavanaugh. What happened to him and his family was an absolute disgrace. And by the way, we have many women here -- remember, I won women -- remember how... We have many women here.
We have many women here, some of whom have been with me like this whole group. From the beginning, from almost before the beginning. We have many women -- and as I'm saying how unfairly he's been treated, they're all nodding. Look at you. They're all nodding their head. He was treated very unfairly. But you know what?
We won. And he's going to be there for many, many years. And we put another great one there, Justice Gorsuch. You know that, Neil Gorsuch. Those are two great people. Scholars, brilliant, genius. Number one in their class. Number one at Yale. Number one at Yale Law. One of the greatest records you've ever seen.
I used to hear about now Justice Kavanaugh. I used to hear 10 years ago. I said, there's a young man named Kavanaugh. Brett Kavanaugh. He's going to be a Supreme Court judge someday. I say, well, I'll never have anything to do, because I'm having a lot of fun building buildings. I'm not -- why do you mention it to me? And look what happened, right?
Look what happened. Look what happened. We had a lot of fun. This has been the greatest movement in the history of our country. Remember that. And in the history of most countries. Don't let them take it away with the -- with the false reporting and everything else. Don't let them take it away. This will be the election of the Kavanaughs and the caravans and law and order and tax cuts.
And you know what? This will be an election, frankly, of common sense, right? It's common sense. You know, they say, are you a conservative? I say, yeah, I guess. But, you know, really what I am, I think have common sense. Most of this stuff is common sense. We need borders. We need borders. We need a great military.
We want low taxes. We want great education. You know, it's like, really, it's not conservative or liberal. It's common sense, right? This election will decide the next speaker of the House. And you know what I just said. We have to have great people there. And, you know, we have a tiny, tiny majority, so small, you just can't -- I won't say it. I've said it so many times.
If a senator catches a cold, we delay the vote. That's the kind of majority we have. We essentially don't have a majority, OK? I think we're doing great in the Senate. And I think we're going to do really good in the House, but getting Mark and Ted in there, North Carolina, so important. Vote for Mark and Ted.
And before we continue, let me take a moment to send our love and support to our fellow citizens in North Carolina, South Carolina, and throughout the Southeast who are still recovering from your devastating -- that was a rain-soaked hurricane. That was a lot of water. I was here. I was here, and I was in South Carolina, and you got hit.
That was less wind, but more water, right? That was a bad one. But FEMA, first responders, the Coast Guard, the military, your local people have done a fantastic job. Fantastic. I spoke to somebody backstage who got hit hard. And I spoke to that person like just when it happened. And tonight, I said, so how's it? OK? He didn't know what I was talking about.
He's recovered so -- they -- you worked hard. And government worked hard. And it was really government and the people working together, and the way that North Carolina came back and South Carolina came back. And now we have Florida and Georgia, different. Michael. That was a different kind. Less water, but those winds were about as big as anybody's ever seen.
They just wiped out -- they ripped foundations. They didn't just knock a house down. They ripped the foundations out. That was like a massive tornado. The damage is incredible. I've never seen anything like it. Never. But I just want to say, congratulations on doing a great job. And it's being finished up. And it's incredible the job.
North Carolina, congratulations. Congratulations. And tonight we also remember a fallen hero. North Carolina Highway Patrol Officer Kevin Conner, who's family's here. His great family is here. Officer Conner was shot and killed in the line of duty on Wednesday. He was an 11-year veteran of the force, and he leaves behind a great wife and two young, beautiful children.
This evening, all of America holds Officer Conner's family in our hearts and prayers, and we pledge our undying gratitude and support to the men and women of law enforcement. They're incredible. They are incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. We are honored to be joined tonight by many of your great North Carolina Republican leaders, including Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest.
Where's Dan? Where are they? Where -- where are they? Where are they? Where's Dan? There he is. A lot of people in here, Dan. It's hard to find one very good-looking man. There are a lot of people in this -- thank you. Dan, thank you very much. Great job. And tell your son to get his cold better. Dan said, sir, this is my son.
I'm so proud of him. Sir, he has a cold. Don't shake his hand. [Laughter] And what did I say, Dan? I said, Dan, thank you very much, right? [Laughter] Tell him to take care of his cold. Another man who has been such a help to me in Washington, a really good guy, works hard, loves the people of North Carolina, Senator Thom Tillis.
Thom? Where is Thom? Where is Thom? I found him. There's a lot of people, Thom. Great job. Thom Tillis, great job. They're toying with me. They're putting all these people in different locations. Usually they have them, like, in one location. Sir, everybody's on the right. Now they have them all over the place.
Thank you, Thom. Thank your family, too. Great job. And Representative -- he's got the greatest name in all of politics -- Patrick McHenry. If you can't win with that name... Where's Patrick? Look at him. He's over in a different location. Patrick, they're toying with us. Patrick McHenry, greatest name in politics, and one of the most talented people in politics, maybe that's more important to me, Patrick.
Thank you. You do a fantastic job. And also a man who's become so popular -- and I was with him from almost before he announced -- and I'll never forget, a couple of years ago, he was running, and he was favored by so much that nobody went out to vote. Can you believe that can happen? He was favored -- and I called him, I said, wow, that was closer than we thought.
Literally, people thought -- they love him, and that'll never happen again. I mean, he still won by a lot. But a lot of people didn't vote for a man named Ralph Norman, who's fantastic. Ralph, wherever you are, Ralph? Ralph, right, Ralph? Remember I called you? I said, Ralph, never be so far in front that they don't want to vote, OK? Never let that happen.
You're always one point down the next time, Ralph. Thank you, Ralph. Great job. And, Ralph, I'll tell you, he's done a great job. We're also thrilled to be joined by a North Carolina native, because I love NASCAR. Do we like NASCAR? I love NASCAR. And I really love -- you know what I'm talking about -- the France family and Brian France.
And Brian, we love you. Get in there, Brian. Brian's going to be in great shape. Brian is a tough winner. And that whole France family, they have pretty good -- you know, that's like owning the entire NFL. You know that, right? What a great thing. NASCAR. We love NASCAR. I love the drivers. I don't know if you know it -- and I'm not saying this for political reasons, because it doesn't matter -- but I spend a lot of time in Lake Norman, right?
Lake Norman. And a lot of the drivers live in my job, in Lake Norman. And these guys, I'll tell you what, they take me for drives every once in a while, and they get it up to 200, 250. I say get me the hell out of this car. [Laughter] Get me out of here. But we have one of the greatest winners ever in NASCAR, and now his grandson maybe will turn out to be an even bigger winner than him.
You know who I'm talking about? Richard Childress. Where is Richard? Where is Richard? Where is Richard? Richard Childress. Is your grandson going to be better than you, Richard? Huh? Yes. See, that's the love. I have many friends who are bad people. Bad. Very successful. And if their son is very successful, they're jealous of their son.
You're supposed to love your son and grandson. And if they're more -- but, OK, so you're happy for your grandson, right? Good. Didn't he just won the big one? That's good. That means he definitely knows how to drive, huh? He's got that little -- got that extra spurt. Thank you very much, Richard. Great job.
What a great career. Thanks, Richard. He's been with us from the beginning, Richard Childress. That's a winner for you, Richard. Richard's a winner. Finally, it's my honor to introduce two outstanding Republican candidates, the people that we're here for, really. With Richard and the governor and the senator, Thom, and all -- we're really here tonight -- Thom, we're really here for these two great congressmen now and soon to be congressman, OK? And they have run fantastic campaigns.
They're doing very well. But honestly, get out and vote. Let's not take a chance, OK? Let's not take a chance. Let's not take a chance. So I want to ask for Ted Budd and Mark Harris to please come forward. Please. Ted Budd is a champion for the people of this state. He voted to cut your taxes, protect your pre-existing conditions, build a border wall, which we're working on, and wait until you see what we're doing next week.
You're not even going to believe it. And protect your Second Amendment rights. And Mark Harris is another true fighter for North Carolina. He will vote to protect your jobs and cut regulations like never before, because that's what we're doing. He will vote to save your health care, secure our border, and stop illegal immigration. Ted and Mark, say a few words. Come on.
Well, good evening, North Carolina. Thank you all for being here. So, Mr. President, I want to thank you for your hard work. You're traveling all over this country, trying to get great members of Congress elected and re-elected, too. Now, the status quo in Washington is trying to stop you, Mr. President, at every turn.
We know that. Yes, we do. But here in North Carolina, Mr. President, we are proud of you. And we want you to know... Mr. President, we have your back here in North Carolina. Absolutely. Now, my opponent is not for making America great again. Sorry. So she's against the tax cuts. And -- this is important -- she's given big money to Pelosi and all her friends.
So, Mr. President, I'm going to stand with you on cutting taxes, on building the wall... and draining the swamp. It's all yours.
Well, let me join my voice tonight in welcoming the president of the United States to Charlotte, North Carolina. We are so excited about where we find ourselves tonight. You know, I read an article not long ago -- in fact, it was just last week -- where one of the Fox commentators, Marc Thiessen, had actually written an article that said that President Trump -- that you may, indeed, go down as the most truthful president in the history of our country.
And what really got my attention was when you read through the article, he built the case in an incredible way, because he reminded us that it was Donald J. Trump that promised us that if he got elected president, he was going to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and he got it done.
He promised us that he was going to bring historic tax reform. And guess what? He got it done. He told us he was going to roll back regulations and stimulate this economy. And guess what? He's gotten it done. And he told us that he was going to appoint to the United States Supreme Court justices who are originalists and understood their job was to interpret the law, not make the law, because that's the job of Congress.
And the only things that haven't gotten done yet, we're going to do it in 2019 when the Congress convenes, because we're going to hold the Republican majority in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate. Mr. President, I want to join you and let's get the job done. God bless you. God bless America. [Audience chants USA]
Come on, that's pretty good, huh? That's pretty good. Thank you very much. Mark and Ted, thank you very much. Get them to Washington, please, fast. I think they're looking pretty good. What do you think? But I'm here tonight because we can't take any chances, right? Can't take any chances. Get out and vote.
Ted's opponent, Kathy Manning, is an extreme liberal Democrat... and a donor, as they said, and a donor to the campaign of Nancy Pelosi. And she's a big fan of Maxine Waters. Maxine Waters. But I'm going to be nice tonight, so I won't say it. I won't say it. I won't say it. I'm going to be nice. I want them to say, he was so nice tonight.
Kathy Manning pretends to be a moderate, but she will always be bidding for Pelosi and the far-left donors who are backing her campaign. She's a lefty, and she's always going to be voting on the left. And I know your state very well. We won it handily. And I will tell you, you don't love the left too much.
Especially that far left. She wants to raise your taxes, and she is for massive giving of amnesty. So that's the end of her. Mark's opponent, Dan McCready... is another extreme liberal trying to fool voters into believing he's a moderate. Dan McCready will be a vote for Nancy Pelosi and Waters and her radical agenda every single time, every time.
You know, a lot of them were unpopular, like in this state. They say such nice things about me. It's incredible. They're never going to vote for us. They say nice in West Virginia. I have a situation. I like him. But he's never going to vote for us. That's the problem. We have so many states where I won, with, by the way, a great vice president, Mike Pence.
Mike and Karen Pence. Mike and Karen. Doing a great job. But we won by a lot. And some of the ads are like -- they're ads for me, I said, I didn't know they were Republicans. They're Democrats. They're so nice. But a vote for any Democrat anywhere in the country is a vote to put Nancy Pelosi in the speaker's chair and to put far-left Democrats in charge of every committee and investigation in Congress.
Our Congress will come to a halt. A vote for Democrats is also a vote to destroy Medicare. A majority of Democrats on the ballot for Congress have already signed up for a government takeover of health care that would eliminate the private insurance of 5.4 million people from North Carolina. You don't want that.
And you'll have to wait. You'll have to wait like our great soldiers, our great warriors. They had to wait for two weeks and three weeks and seven weeks and -- to see a doctor. Do that plan, you'll be waiting for seven weeks to do that, also. We have people from other nations, where they have something similar, they come here when they need help, because they don't have good medical care and they have to wait so long.
The Democrat plan would -- it would just obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage for almost 7 -- do you know about this? Has anyone heard this? It will obliterate 700,000 North Carolina seniors who have been paying for this for years will not be taken care of anymore. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it. And frankly, if you know about this stuff, they paid for it. They've been paying for it for many years.
And Republicans will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. The Democrats will also destroy health care by giving free health care to illegal immigrants and much more than that. As we speak, the Democrat Party is openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and bankrupt our country.
That's what has to happen. Democrats' extreme immigration policies will overwhelm your schools, your hospitals, and communities, and strain public resources to the breaking point. And Democrat sanctuary cities, a term you don't love too much around here, release criminal aliens straight out of jail and right onto your streets.
Congratulations. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And the Republican Party will always stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. And we started the wall, and we'll finish the wall, but we have to do it faster.
We want the money to finish the wall. And watch next week what's going to happen, just wait. It'll be exciting. Going to be exciting, Thom. It's going to be great. If you want to uphold our laws, our borders, and our way of life, you need to vote for Ted Budd and for Mark Harris. Go out and vote for them.
This election is about borders. This election is about jobs. In less than two years, we have created more than 4.2 million new jobs and lifted more than 4 million Americans off of food stamps. We've created almost half a million new manufacturing jobs. African-American poverty has reached an all-time low.
African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest rates in the history of our country. That's not bad. That's not bad. That's not bad. That's going to be a good soundbite in the debate. Hispanic American, African American, Asian American, the best unemployment statistics in the history of our country.
What is my opponent going to be doing with that one? And this has all happened recently, folks. And if our opponent and my opponent ever got elected, we'd be heading south. We would be in such problems right now as a country. It was going that way. You know it was going that way. You know, every time I come to a venue like this or any venue, almost every time somebody comes back and says, big guy -- back stage -- and he goes, sir, thank you very much for saving our country.
Thank you very much. Happened -- happens all the time. This is a big, tough guy. Obviously from North Carolina. This is a guy he's -- he's almost got -- most of them do have, but this one's too proud to cry, but he had tears. And he just said that -- and I have so many people saying that. And, you know, when it first happened, when we first started doing all of these things with regulations and tax cuts, I used to hear it, and I'd say, what do they mean?
They really -- they're right. Because if this country would have gone on the path that it was going on for many years, not just the last eight years, our country could never recover, it could never be the same. We were heading down the wrong path. And I didn't save it. We all saved it. Because I said before, the greatest movement in the history -- this is the greatest political movement in the history of our country.
It is. I'm not even running for office. Look at this crowd. No, look at this crowd. I'm not even running. Think of it. Think of it. You know, the president came to North Carolina, just a nice president, a good president, even a really good president, like Ronald Reagan. If a president came to North Carolina, what would happen?
They'd go to a hotel. They'd have a conference room. That's my kind of guy right there. That's my kind of guy. No, nice president, they go to a hotel. They'd have a conference room, 300 people, 350, and that would be considered a success. They'd say, wow, that was a good success. That was worthwhile. We have -- the other night in Houston, the Houston Rockets, the arena, packed, set a new record.
Outside, tens of thousands of people, 109,000 people -- 109,000 people wanted to come. And every place. Every place. Every place. But if they came to North Carolina, nice president, 300, 350 people, and then they go back to the White House. Look at this crowd. It's crazy. Go out and vote for Mark and Ted.
Now, the thing I failed with -- because it's not historic -- you know that. You know what I'm going to say. I failed with women because women's unemployment only fell to 3.6 percent, which is only the lowest in 65 years. Everyone else is historic. Sorry. We're going to get it. I've been saying this. You know what?
I've been saying this for two months. And every month, every week, I say, give me the number on the women. Because we're very close to historic. I want to get rid of the 65 years. The best number in 65 years. But African Americans have done better. Asians have done better. Hispanic Americans, because theirs is -- but we will come through for the women soon.
It's this close. I want to get rid of the 65 years. It's not good enough. Anybody else would be very happy. I'm not happy with that one. Earlier this month, I announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal. One of the worst trade deals ever made. Our jobs, everything left our country. Our jobs, our plants, our factories, they left for Mexico, for Canada, one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world.
There is one worse -- I won't tell you -- but we're working on that one, too. And we replaced it with an incredible, brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement called the USMCA. Like YMCA. MCA. Which is a giant victory for North Carolina farmers, manufacturers, and dairy producers. They're opening up their markets.
Nobody thought that would be possible. They're opening -- Thom understands it. Thom, we're all happy with that. We're all happy. Thom Tillis, we're all happy with that. Everybody's happy with that. Even Chuck Schumer said, yeah, it's a good deal. I said, I want to go back and inspect that deal. There must be something.
[Laughter] You got a lot of bipartisan support on that. That has to be good, to get bipartisan support, Thom Tillis. But people like it. People like it. And it's true. Senator Schumer liked it. We've also taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practice. We had to do it. Had to do it. China's been taking hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year out of our country for many years.
We have helped rebuild China. I said, it's time to stop. And we are doing very well. We are doing very well. That's all I can say. They want to make a deal. I say they're not ready yet. They want to make a deal. First time you've ever seen this, though? First time -- you've never seen this before. China's had free wheel of our country.
Give them whatever they want. Not anymore. Every day is promises made, promises kept. You hear that, Childress? You hear that, Mr. Childress, with those racing cars? You've got to be crazy to drive those cars. We're bringing down the price of prescription drugs. Americans are tired of subsidizing the lower prices for other countries.
And that's how it happened. By paying the highest prices -- we pay the highest prices anywhere in the world. Congratulations, everybody. Yesterday, we just did something that was so terrific with Secretary Azar, a great gentleman, and we took the historic action to stop global freeloading and put American patients first.
We're putting our people first. And I'm very proud because Senator Tillis and others have really helped on this. We have approved after 44 years patients get life-saving treatments that we passed. It's called right to try. You know that, right? We have the greatest research in the world, the greatest drug companies in the world, the greatest doctors in the world.
We have the greatest. And it would be on line -- it's the pipeline. And it took 12 years, 14, 15, to get something -- we've got it done to a much shorter period, like four years, maybe less. But we have to be careful. But we have in some cases drugs or treatments or therapies that are fantastic. They're really looking good.
And there was no way legally you could do it to help somebody who was terminally ill. Very ill. Terminally ill. We couldn't use it. People were leaving the country. If they had money, they'd go all over the world. They'd go to Asia. They'd go to Europe. Go to Africa. They'd go all over the world looking for a cure.
Because we couldn't do it. And it sounded like, for me, not even a contest. Now you'll have what's called -- it's the name of the bill -- the right to try. Right to try. And it's had an amazing impact. I signed it two-and-a-half months ago. And I'm so proud of it. Went through Congress. Went through the Senate.
Thom helped. They all helped. And I'll tell you what, it's great. And you know what? We've had some incredible stories. We've had some incredible results. And one of the things is, you really do know whether or not something works. OK? You really do know. But we've had some incredible stories, right to try.
Hopefully nobody in this room needs it. Right? We don't want it. But if you need it, you can have the best in the world without having to go around. It's called hope. Hope. We passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor, and the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be fully accountable.
That's right. You're fired. Get out. Boom. You're fired! We secured $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year to fully rebuild the United States military, all made in the United States. Everything built in the United States. [Audience chants USA] All built in the United States. At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force.
Very important. Very important, cutting-edge. It's all heading out to space. I hate to say it. Whether we like it or not, it's all heading out to space, so we have tremendous support. We have tremendous support. Remember all that support, Thom. We have great support. Everybody loves the space. And this is where it's at. This is where it's at. Whoa.
Whoa. It's true. People get so excited with the Space Force. But that's where it's at. I'm not doing it as fun and games. That's where it's at. And I'm just talking about missiles going up or rockets going to Mars or going to -- which is very exciting. I like that. I say let the private guys do it, you know?
They're all having fun. Let 'em do it. We'll rent them our great facilities. That's what we're doing. We're renting them our great facilities. Let them spend their money. They want to go to Mars, I love it. They can hop in the ship themselves. I couldn't care less. They want to do it, I'm OK with it. They're rich.
I don't know, rich guys seem to like space. And I say they want to use our facilities, we'll charge them a small amount of money, like, you know, how about $25 million a launch? They'll say OK. But NASA has been reinvigorated. But we need it from the standpoint of protection, offense, defense. We need it for our military.
I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear catastrophe. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And instead of spending $1.1 billion, I opened it up for $400,000. You know that. You know. Have you all heard that story? OK. They want to hear it again.
But we have opened it up for slightly less than budget. Budget was $1.1 billion. I'm saying, how do you spend -- do you have any builders here, like knock up houses and things? How do you spend $1.1 billion for a one-story building? We'll try and figure this out. But they came to my office. Sir, would you sign this?
I said, OK, I'm sighing -- because I sign so many papers. And I have Donald, so what's it for, General? Sir, we are building the U.S. embassy in Israel, sir. How much? $1.1 billion, sir. I said, whoa, whoa, whoa. [Laughter] I said, we'll never get this passed by Thom Tillis, $1.1 billion. We're not going to pass -- I'm not going to -- don't worry, I'm not sending it to you anyway.
[Laughter] I said, what do you mean? Sir, it will cost -- we're looking for land right now. So I called up David Friedman, one of the best lawyers in New York, one of the biggest. He loves Israel. And he wanted -- he gave up -- he made a fortune. And he gave up this massive amount of money. I won't even tell you what he made, too much.
But he gave it up because he wanted to be the ambassador to Israel. I called David, very smart guy. I said, David, they want to spend $1.1 billion to build the embassy in Jerusalem. It's crazy. He said, could I work on it? Yeah. Calls me back two days later, he says, sir, we own the best piece of land in Jerusalem.
We have a building on the piece of land. It's set back from the standpoint of terrorism. They want to set back. They don't like it on the street. We all understand that, right? It's set back beautifully. It's on a big site, like I think 18 acres, which is a massive site. We've owned it for a long time. We have a building on it. It's a good building, but it needs some renovation.
We can take a big chunk of the building, renovate it. Sir, I can have it done for $180,000, he told me. $180,000. $180,000. So I said, wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's the first time I've ever done this in my life. I shouldn't tell you this. I'll get in trouble. They'll get me in trouble. I said, wait a minute, David.
You won't believe what I'm going to say. I said, that sounds too cheap. It's no good. He said, I can do it for $180,000. I said, David, it's too cheap. Do it for $400,000 or $500,000. Please don't do it for $180,000. $180,000, they're going to think you're kidding. Do it for like $400,000. Is that OK? Absolutely.
And there's a stone called Jerusalem stone. I have a friend. He's a very rich person, the great Ron Baron. He's a great hedge fund guy, great, brilliant guy. And for years, he brags about his office. He said, I use Jerusalem stone. He gets it in Jerusalem. And it's one of the most expensive -- he's so proud of it. He's more proud of Jerusalem stone than he is of his career, and he's made billions, OK? Really.
And he always wants to show me his Jerusalem stone. I've been hearing it for years. So I said, David, didn't you use Jerusalem stone? You're in Jerusalem. He said, absolutely. I get it for peanuts. Can you believe it? So we have all Jerusalem stone. It's beautiful. And we ended up spending $400,000, and we opened it four months after I agreed to do it in the first place.
We saved $1.1 billion. We got it opened. Don't forget, the $1.1 billion as a lot of people in this room would say, probably would never have gotten built. And if it did, it would have cost $4.4 billion, so we did it for $400,000, and we're proud of it. And by the way, it's beautiful. It's really beautiful.
They had their opening. It's beautiful. They have their embassy. They have their capital. And a lot of people are happy. Together we've made extraordinary progress. But we're just getting started. If you vote Republican this November, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes, because that's what we're doing.
We will protect Medicare and Social Security. We will continue to confirm judges who will interpret our Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border for you. We will pass Kate's law, which has already been passed by the House. We will stop sanctuary cities... stop catch-and-release, end the visa lottery that we talked about, end chain migration, and we will keep the criminal drug dealers and terrorists the hell out of our country.
We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's going to happen. For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. Very simply, standing up for America.
We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for North Carolina. And we are standing proudly up for our great national anthem. To continue our incredible momentum, you need to get your friends, get your family, get your coworkers, and get out and vote for Ted Budd and Mark Harris, and vote Republican.
We're going to win. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people. We stand on the shoulders of brave Americans who crossed the oceans, tamed the wilderness, secured our independence, won two world wars, and built the greatest country and most powerful military in the history of the world.
American patriots defeated fascism, vanquished communism, and delivered millions into freedom. Our ancestors put down the mighty railroads, linked up the roaring highways, dug out the Panama Canal, and planted an American flag on the face of the moon. These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our very proud American heritage.
For the sake of freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win, and we are going to keep on winning. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in, we will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender.
And we will never, ever lose. We will only fight to victory every single time. Because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
And together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. We will make America great again. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you. Thank you.
And I didn't know Lee Greenwood would be here. That was a surprise. That was a surprise. Wow. We love that voice, and we love that song, don't we? Thank you, Lee. Boy oh boy, that was great. That was great. And I want to thank our great vice president, Mike Pence. Thank you. Fantastic job. I know I speak for everyone here when I say we are all, indeed, proud to be Americans.
Right? And I'm thrilled to say that I love Tennessee. I am thrilled. And to be here with the hard-working men and women who are the heart and soul of our country, and that's true. That's true. In just two days, the people of Tennessee are going to elect Marsha Blackburn -- Marsha -- to the U.S. Senate to protect your jobs, defend your borders, and continue making America great again.
This is one of the most important elections of our time. I don't know if I rate it more important than the last election, '16. But it's almost -- it's right there. This is really one of the most important elections that we will ever have the privilege of voting in and for. This is a big one. It'll decide whether we build on the extraordinary prosperity that we've achieve for our nation or whether we let the radical Democrats take control of Congress... and take a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to our future.
And, by the way, did you see those numbers on Friday? Those are big numbers. America now has the hottest economy on Earth. No matter who comes in to see me in the Oval Office, when it's a president, when it's a prime minister, a queen, a king, they all start off by saying it's incredible what happened to the economy of the United States.
It's unbelievable. And they try and duplicate it, but you can't duplicate our people, can you, huh? In the last month alone, we added another 250,000 jobs and nearly half a million Americans rejoined the workforce. We created a total of 4.5 million new jobs since the election. And by the way, the media would have never believed it if I said it on the campaign.
They would have never believed it. They would have said, he shouldn't be allowed to say that. And we've lifted 4.3 million Americans off of food stamps. And the unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years, five-oh. More Americans are working today than ever before. Think of that, in the history of our country, we have more people working today than ever before, nearly 157 million Americans now have a job.
African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, unemployments, all of them, all of these groups, have all reached their lowest level in the history of our country. Think of that. Poverty is plummeting. Wages are rising. Incomes are soaring. And the confidence level of our businesses and our people is at an all-time high.
Other than that, we're not doing so well. Good. Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. We've got to win Congress, in all fairness. Just -- because the Democrats won't be doing that. The Democrats are going to be raising your taxes.
They're not cutting your taxes. So I have to put a little caveat. We've got to win Congress. Got to win the House. I think we're doing great in the House. I think we're doing great in the Senate. But who knows, right? Who knows? You've got to get out to vote. But I will say, there is an electricity in the air the likes of which I and you have not seen since the '16 election.
And you don't hear so much about that big blue wave anymore. They may do fine. They may do fine. Who knows? But the -- you don't hear about the wave, the wave is coming, the wave is coming. I'll tell you, with the statistics I just rattled off, who could do better than that? We're breaking every record practically in the history of our country, right?
And very importantly, we're taking care of our great veterans and we are rebuilding America's -- and you know this -- you know what was happening to our military. It was depleted. It was tired. It was exhausted. The plans were old. Everything was tired. We are rebuilding America's military might like it's never been rebuilt before.
And hopefully we'll never have to use it, but I can tell you, the stronger we become, the less likely it is that we will have to use it, OK? And we are building it at a level that has never been done before, $700 billion and $716 billion the following year. Under Republican leadership, America is respected again.
And America is winning again, because we are finally putting America first. And to protect your rights and freedoms, we overcame the Democrats' smear campaign and confirmed the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And speaking of Justice Kavanaugh, great man, great intellect, a great scholar.
They thought 10 years ago, long before I thought I'd be doing this, I was very happy in Manhattan having a lot of fun building buildings. I was very happy. But long before, I used to hear the name Brett Kavanaugh as being this great intellect, Washington, he will be on the Supreme Court someday. And when I told him that it's my honor -- because we did great with, as you know, Justice Neil Gorsuch -- you know that.
And when I saw -- when I saw and heard about, we have another vacancy, and I said, wow, what a great time. And I had Brett Kavanaugh, judge at that time, over to the White House, I said, Judge, this is going to be so easy. Congratulations. I'm going to nominate you for the United States Supreme Court. I said this is going to -- you are so central casting.
Great marks, great schools, the best everything, the best of everything. Your family, your wife, your children, you don't have a problem in the world. You are the greatest. I said, judge, this is a piece of cake. And you know what? The Democrats, what they did to him. But you heard on Friday what happened.
One of his accusers came out and said she never met him, she never met him, that she made up this story, was a total lie. Rape, rape! It was a total lie. It was a total lie. It was fake. It was a fake -- it was a fake story. Totally fake story. False accusations. It was false accusations. She made up this story.
It was a lie. And think of this. What would have happened if he didn't make it because of her lie? What would have happened? Think of that, how -- how unfair would that -- can you imagine? That could have happened. There was a lot of pressure on him, and there was pressure on me, frankly. These stories were coming out.
And now we have to find out about the others with their accusations. OK? But I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, well, already the other one are falling down. You look at what's going on there. But this woman came out of nowhere, and because of the pressure, she admitted that it was a total lie, it was a fabricated story.
And think of the fact -- think of this. If he didn't -- supposing he withdrew or I was forced to do something, which, frankly, I wouldn't do. I wouldn't do. It's a disgrace. And the way the Democrats tried to destroy this human being, this great man, who will be a Supreme Court justice at the highest level for hopefully many, many decades.
Young man. But the way they tried to destroy him, and they knew what they were doing. They knew. Dianne Feinstein with the lies and the leaks. The leaks. How about the leak? Did you leak it? Remember, right? You remember? Did you leak it? That was John Cornyn of Texas, did a great job. Just said, did you leak it? No, no, did we leak anything?
And the guy shouts back, no, turn around, no. Turn around. He didn't say turn around, I won't say, because they'll give me a hard time. And then she goes, no, uh, no, we didn't leak it. Which I consider that to be maybe the worst body language I've ever seen. But anyway, so we have Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court of the United States.
Great. The contrast in this election could not be more clear. Democrats produce mobs. Republicans produce jobs. It's true. A vote for any Democrat on Tuesday is a vote to hand power to cryin' Chuck Schumer... Nancy Pelosi... and, of course, the legendary Maxine Waters. And to -- Maxine's in charge of banking, by the way.
That'll be good. China will be thrilled to hear that. And to implement their extreme job-killing agenda, they want to raise your taxes by double and even by triple. I don't think the people in Tennessee want that. They don't want that. Lee Greenwood does not want it. Lee, do you mind if your taxes go up three times?
He doesn't mind, but his wife is not happy right now. They want to increase regulations. They want to take away your health care. They want to impose socialism on our country. And they want to erase America's borders. Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to pour into our country.
I don't think so. I don't think so. No nation can allow its borders to be overrun. And that's an invasion. I don't care what they say. I don't care what the fake media says. That's an invasion of our country. [Audience chants Build that wall] Thank you. And you're right. And we started the wall. We have $1.6 billion.
And we just got another $1.6 billion. And we're getting another $1.6 billion. But we want to build it all at one time. We want to get it done. And it's happening. It's all happening. It's all happening. But we need Republicans or the Democrats have to start voting for this, because this is the worst immigration laws anywhere in the world.
The world laughs at us. The world sees this stuff, catch-and-release. They come onto our land. Other people say get out. We say, congratulations, you're going to end up in court for the next four years. Can you believe it? Can you believe it? That's why I am telling the caravans, the criminals, the smugglers, the trespassers marching toward our border, turn back now, because you are not getting in. Turn back.
For years, we only defended the borders of foreign countries. We protect their borders, but we don't protect ours. Now we are defending the borders of our country. So very simply, if you want more caravans and more crime, because crime comes with it, vote for the Democrats. Vote for them. If you want strong borders and safe communities, vote for the Republicans.
It's very simple. We are grateful to be joined today by many distinguished Tennessee Republicans. What a great group. They've helped me so much. I want to thank your state's lieutenant governor, Randy McNally, where's Randy? Where's Randy? Thank you. Great, thank you, Randy. Great job you're doing. And your state GOP Chair Scott Golden.
Thank you, Scott. Thank you for doing a great job for me, too, Scott. That was a very good job. Thank you very much. I also want to thank your terrific Republican members of Congress. Are you guys ready? Are you guys ready? Lot of times, you know, they don't put them in one area, and I'm looking all over.
These big stadiums, they're always packed, because we have something going on, folks. There's something happening. Something is happening. That's going to be an interesting day. We're going to do fine. We're going to do very good. We could do great. We could do great. Congressman Phil Roe, Phil, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Great guy. A man who came to see me speak in Pennsylvania, and he said to me -- been long-term congressman, loves this state. And he said to a couple of friends of mine, who are also congressmen. I like congressmen, and women. I actually like the women better, but that's OK. He came to speak.
And you have early voting in Tennessee. And he talked to me backstage. I was going on. I was getting ready to go on. And near the Philadelphia area, we had a big stadium, it was beautiful. And he came up, he goes, you know, I have to tell you something. I wasn't president. So he goes, Mr. Trump, he goes, I want to just tell you that, I don't know what's going on, but I've been a congressman for a long time.
And I have people coming in Tennessee, and they've got the Trump hat and the Trump banners and the Trump shirts and the Trump gloves and shoes and socks. And these are people that haven't voted in years, because they never really liked who they were supposed to be voting for. And now they're pouring in with banners and everything.
He said, and those lines -- early voting -- he said and those lines are so long, I've never seen anything like it. And he said those red hats and the white hats and every other hat, he said I've never seen anything like it. And he was the first one that told me. He said, and all I can say is this. If other states are like the great state of Tennessee, you're going to become president.
And his name is Congressman John Duncan. Right? Right, John? He said, I've never seen anything like it. People that aren't even political, they have Trump all over. Good. And you know what I'm happiest about, we're overperforming, because everything I said, we are doing -- who thought the economy would be this good?
I wouldn't have been allowed to say it. They wouldn't have allowed it to be said. Who thought we would have in just a short period -- not even two years, the greatest economy we've ever had in the history of our country? Another great friend of mine -- they're all friends of mine -- Congressman Chuck Fleischmann.
OK, thank you. A man with one of the most beautiful names I've ever heard, Congressman Scott DesJarlais. What a name. If I had the name, I would have been president 20 years ago. And Congressman David Kustoff. David? Thank you, David. Great job. Along with the next congressman for Tennessee's sixth district, John Rose.
You know John Rose? I hear great things. I hear great things about John Rose. Thanks, John. It's a great group. You really do. You have a great group. And I know they're all winning big and all that stuff. Go vote anyway. We don't want to take any chances, OK? Fellas, you don't mind if I tell them that, right?
We don't want to take any chances. They're all good. They're great. But we don't want to take any chance that we get a little bit carried away with ourselves. So go out and vote. I don't want to see any extremely depressed former congressmen from Tennessee. Great job. That's a great group of people, I'll tell you what.
They love your country. They love this state. Thank you very much, fellas. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you, thank you. If you don't want to be saying Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the next two years... you have to get out and vote for John now, because he's the newcomer. And vote for these great Republican lawmakers.
When you head to the polls on Tuesday, you will be deciding whether you want to keep this economic boom like we've never had before going strong, and we can do it. Frankly, I'll tell you what, honestly, we haven't even begun. We have such potential. We have such potential. As crazy as it sounds, we have such potential.
Or whether you want to let the resistance take it all away, and it can go quickly. Your next senator, Marsha Blackburn, will keep your economy thriving, your wages rising, your jobs soaring, and she will keep your families and communities safe. She loves this state. She will be a tireless champion for Tennessee.
Marsha is running against a far-left liberal, and you're finding that out finally, named Phil Bredesen. The hand-picked candidate of Chuck Schumer. Schumer begged Phil to run because he knows that Phil will always do what Schumer says and always, always do what Nancy Pelosi wants him to do. Phil will block pro-Constitution judges.
He will cut funding to our military and law enforcement. He will embrace a socialist takeover of health care. And Phil totally supports the Democrats' open border madness. What's that all about? What is that all about? If you want to stop the liberal agenda of high taxes and high crime, you need to vote for Marsha Blackburn.
Marsha, please come up. Marsha.
Thank you all so very much for being here and for everything that you're doing to help elect Republicans this cycle. And thank you so much for all you did to send President Donald Trump and Mike Pence to the White House. They are doing... Our president and vice president have had quite a 21 months. And the vice president said a few things about that.
Just think. Record low unemployment. Wages are growing. You are seeing so much done all across the globe. We're out of the Iran deal. We've defeated... We've defeated ISIS in Syria. North Korea, China being held accountable. And our U.S. embassy is in Jerusalem, where it belongs. And to keep this working, I think Tennesseans want a U.S. senator who is going to do exactly what she says she is going to do when she goes to Washington, D.C. Now, let me tell ya, if my opponent, Phil Bredesen, had his way, Hillary Clinton, who he gave $33,400 to, would be president and not any of these things would be happening.
So if you want to have somebody... [Audience chants Lock her up] All right. If you want to have somebody who's going to support more constitutional judges and is going to be there to support tax cuts, be there to build the wall, I ask you to... I ask you to stand with me. And if you want to vote no on Hillary Clinton and her cronies one more time, stand with me. Let's win this election on Tuesday.
Thank you.
She's going to do a great job. Thank you very much. That was great. Thank you. Thank you, Marsha. If Democrats gain power on Tuesday, they will try to raid your Medicare to fund socialism. You know that. The Democrat health care plan would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than half a million Tennessee seniors.
They're not going to be happy. Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors, who earned it, and by the way, they paid for it. You know that. They paid for it. They paid for it. And Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Please remember that. Democrats' plan to destroy health care also includes giving away your benefits to illegal immigrants.
You know that. As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and destroy our nation in so many different ways. And they want to sign them up for free welfare, free health care, free education, and most importantly, the right to vote. They want them to vote.
Come on in and vote. They love them voting. Illegal immigration costs our country more than $100 billion every single year. That's almost three times the entire state budget of the state of Tennessee. Not only do the Democrats' open border policies drain our Treasury, but they endanger every American community.
And you people know that better than anybody. Nearly 100 percent of the heroin coming into the United States enters through our southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of the cocaine, the majority of meth, and a substantial portion of the ultra-lethal fentanyl, which is killing our youth at record numbers.
We can't allow this. These drugs kill 70,000 Americans every single year and destroy the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Last year alone, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 127,000 aliens with criminal records. Wow! Think of that, 127,000. Think of that, 127 -- ICE, they want to fire ICE.
They don't like 'em. They think they're a little bit too rough. They're dealing with tough customers. But listen to this. It's including those charged or convicted of approximately 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes, and 1,800 murders. We don't want this, folks. We don't want it. But Democrats want to abolish ICE and turn America into a giant sanctuary city for gang members and MS-13 killers.
Remember when Nancy Pelosi was upset with the way I was talking about MS-13? She -- remember that, though? It's like, they're people, too. They're people, too. Oh, really? Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement.
This election is about safety and it's about prosperity. For years, you watched as we let foreign countries plunder and drain our wealth, shutter our factories, and steal our jobs. But those days are over, Tennessee. Those days are over. We've added nearly half a million manufacturing jobs since the election.
Last month alone, we added another 33 -- think of this -- 33,000 manufacturing jobs, 1,000 each day. Remember the previous administration? We're never going to have manufacturing jobs anymore. By the way, they're among the best jobs we have in our whole country. And very important jobs. The magic wand, he just said.
You need a magic wand to bring them back. Well, I guess we found the magic wand. We found the magic wand. I recently announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal with an incredible, brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. The USMCA, like the song, YMCA, if you have any problem. If you have any problem remember it, just think YMCA.
It's a giant win for Tennessee farmers and autoworkers. And by the way, speaking of autoworkers, we have so many plants, so many companies coming back into the United States, they're all coming back, they want the action. Plus our new deal makes it extremely hard for companies to fire all their workers and leave.
So we're not having that anymore. And I talked about that during the campaign. Not going happen, where they fire our workers, they move to Mexico or another country, they build their cars and then they sell them back here, no tax, no nothing. We end up with no jobs and empty factory. That's not happening anymore.
That's not happening. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices. We're doing very well, by the way. Every day it's promises made, promises kept. And there has been no president or no administration that's had a more successful first two years than we have, with all that we've done.
We've taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. That's happening. You see it. Thanks to our aggressive measures to drive down the price of health insurance, this year premiums on the exchange in Tennessee are plummeting by an average of 26 percent. And we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a disaster.
We took it out. We got rid of it. You think that was easy? Not easy. And we've introduced new affordable plans in this state that are as much as 60 percent cheaper and more than that than Obamacare. To help critically ill patients get life-saving treatments, we passed right to try. I'm very proud of that.
Many, many years they tried to get it passed. Many, many years, right to try. A patient's terminal ill, they travel all over the world trying to find a cure, if they have the money to do that. If they don't, they just don't have hope. They go home. We have the best medical facilities, doctors, research in the world, and if we're getting close, anything in the pipeline, if something's terminally ill, if somebody's very sick, they now will have the right to try the experimental drugs that we have.
And we've had great success. We've had great success. There's been some incredible stories already. That was done three months ago. And last month, I proudly signed the largest bill to fight the opioid epidemic, which is a real big problem. Biggest bill, $6 billion, in American history. We passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to go see a private doctor instead of waiting in line for weeks and weeks and weeks.
Forty-four years, they've been trying to get it done. Forty-four years, we got it done. And the landmark V.A. accountability law, to ensure that anyone who mistreats our veterans will be immediately accountable. You're fired. Get out. Right? And those people right there, those congressmen helped me so much.
That's true, fellas. Thank you. On every one of those. On every one of them, what I just said, every one of them, that group of congressmen, they are incredible. Thank you, fellas. Thank you. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military. And we gave our great warriors their largest pay raise in more than a decade.
And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces. It's called the Space Force. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear catastrophe. And Iran is a much different right now than it was before I took office. They were doing bad things, and they are doing bad things now, but they don't have the same perspective.
They were looking for the Mediterranean. You know what the Mediterranean -- that was a long ways away. They wanted to take over the whole Middle East. Right now, they just want to survive. And we've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Together we've made extraordinary progress, and we are just getting started.
We have a long way to go. That's why we have to get Senator Marsha Blackburn in office as soon as we can. By the way, we have another great senator here. He's from a slightly competitive state. It's called the great state of Georgia, where I just left. The legendary Senator David Perdue. Thank you, David.
Great guy. Great guy. But if Lee Greenwood doesn't like him, I'm going to say, David, you got to get out of here. I'm sorry. But the Democrats want to turn back the clock, throw America in reverse, and return power to a corrupt, selfish ruling class that only looks out for themselves. You see it happening, but we stop it. Our opponents are stuck in the past, while we are rebuilding and going into America's great future.
I need you to vote for a Republican House and a Republican Senate so we can continue this incredible movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country. It is. With your support, we will keep on cutting your taxes, reducing your regulations, growing your jobs, and raising your incomes.
That's what we've been doing. We will protect Medicare and we will protect your Social Security. We will defend your right of free speech, religious liberty, and we will continue to confirm judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border. We will pass Kate's law. We will stop sanctuary cities, stop catch-and-release, and end the visa lottery, end chain migration, and we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists the hell out of our country.
[Audience chants USA] We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Tennessee.
And we are proudly standing up for our great national anthem. I am asking every citizen from every party, every background, and every race, color and creed to reject the Democrat politics of anger and division and to unite behind our proud and righteous destiny as Americans. I need you to get your family, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and go out and vote Republican.
Do it now. Do it Tuesday. We have to get it done. On Election Day I need the people of Tennessee to send a message to cryin' Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, and the radical resistance by voting for Marsha Blackburn. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people.
That's what's happening. This incredible state was tamed by tough frontier men and strong frontier women. This is the state of Davy Crockett and Andrew Jackson. Davy Crockett. Andrew Jackson. And this is the state of generations of proud Tennessee patriots who ventured out into the wilderness and up into the mountains to build a life and a home.
They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud American heritage.
From the majestic valleys of Tennessee to the red rocks of Arizona, Martha McSally, Arizona, McSally, McSally, she's great. She's great. McSally, Arizona. From the big sky of Montana to the green fields of Missouri, from the deserts of Nevada to the everglades of Florida and from the coal mines of West Virginia to the steel mills of Indiana, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win.
We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, we will never surrender, and we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
And Tennessee, together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Tennessee. Thank you.
Thank you so much. What a great honor and privilege to speak to you today. The American Legion is very, very special. So thank you very much. I want to thank Commander Dale Barnett and your vice commanders, and your constitutional officers. You have all done such an incredible job. The fact is, you are incredible people.
[Applause] The men and women of the American Legion represent the best, absolute best of America. Strength, courage, selfless devotion. Your organization and its members have done so much to defend our country, our flag and to advance the cause of Americanism, not globalism. Remember, America first, America first.
Your one group I don't have to tell you to remember it all so, you know it. We are in your debt very deeply. I will never let you down. [Applause] Together, we're going to work on so many shared goals but I want to begin by discussing one goal that I know is so important to you, promoting American pride and patriotism in America's schools.
Very important. In a Trump administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America's children. We want our kids to learn the incredible achievement of America's history, its institutions, and its heroes, many of whom are with us today, I can tell you.
Including, by the way, two special people, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Senator Jeff Sessions. They're right here. [Applause] We will stop apologizing for America. And we will start celebrating America. [Applause] We will be united by our common culture values and principles, becoming one American nation, one country under one constitution, saluting one American flag, and always saluting it. The flag, all of you helped to protect and preserve.
That flag deserves respect and I will work with the American Legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag. You see what's happening. It's very, very sad. And by the way, we want young Americans to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. [Applause] In addition to teaching respect for the flag, we also have to make sure we give our military the tools they need to defend that flag and to deter violence and aggression from our foreign adversaries of which there are many.
We will rebuild our depleted military and pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense. [Applause] We will do it based on those three very famous words: peace through strength. We will make sure our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines have the best equipment, training, tools anywhere in the world. Nobody will be able to compete with us and we will ensure that they have the best medical care in the world, both in service and when they return home as civilians.
[Applause] That will require a total reform of the Veterans Administration. It's in very sad shape. I deal with veterans all the time. We have tremendous veterans support. And the stories I hear are so sad. We're not going to have that anymore. I've laid out a 10-step V.A. reform plan that you can review on my website.
Here are the basics; I will appoint a secretary of Veterans Affairs whose personal mission will be to clean up the V.A., the secretary's sole man will be to serve our veterans, not bureaucrats, not politicians, but our great veterans. I'm going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline anyone who fails our veterans or breaches the public trust, which is what it is, it's a public trust.
I will appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the V.A., and there's plenty, and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for reforming the entire system. We're going to get you fantastic service. It's going to happen. Believe me. We'll ensure every veteran in America gets timely access to top-quality care, including the best care in the world for our female veterans.
[Applause] The Veterans health system will remain a public system because it is after all a public trust, but never again will we allow any veteran to suffer or die waiting for care. That means veterans will have the right to go to a V.A. facility or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice, whatever is the fastest, and best for veterans.
People are not going to die waiting on line to see a doctor. It's not going to happen. [Applause] The veteran will be in total control. Should I have the honor of serving as president, we're also going to start facing the world with confidence again. We are going to uphold the laws of the nation and defend our sovereignty and security and we are going to defend our border.
I just came back from a wonderful meeting with the president of Mexico, where I expressed my deep respect for the people of his country, and for the tremendous contributions of Mexican-Americans in our country and they have made tremendous contributions. Many are in our armed services. You know how good they are.
I want to, again, thank him for his gracious hospitality and express my belief that we can work together to accomplish great things for both countries, that's Mexico and the United States. [Applause] We agreed in the meeting, on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns, drugs, cash, and people across the border and to take out the cartels.
Have to get rid of those cartels and we have to do it quickly. Our country is being poisoned. Our country is being poisoned. We're also talking about and talked about the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere. A more prosperous Mexico means fewer illegal border crossings and a better market for products made in the United States.
When I'm president, I'm going to look at every trade deal we have across the world and see what steps must be taken to protect American jobs and create new opportunities for the American worker. The American worker has been forgotten and we're not going to let that happen. We will fight for every last American jobs and we will have friendships with other countries but they will not take advantage of us any longer, that I can tell you.
We're going to show ourselves and the world again what a strong and growing American economy can look like. We're going to give major tax relief to every worker and small business in this country bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs back to our shores and unleash an American energy revolution, which we have to do. We will also be appointing justices of the United States Supreme Court, who will you be -- you will be very proud.
You will be extremely proud when we name them. You've already seen some of the people and the kind of people that we want. Justice Scalia, passed away recently, serves as an absolute perfect focal point. He is the kind of person we want on the United States Supreme Court. [Applause] I will nominate men and women to the court who meet the high standard of Justice Scalia and judges who have the wisdom and integrity to follow the law and just not make it up any way they want to make it up. [Applause] Above all, these next four years, I will be uncompromising in the defense of the United States and our friends and our good allies.
We are going to end the era of nation building and creating new foreign policy joined by our partners in the Middle East that is focused on destroying ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism. We will extend the hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission. And we want this mission to be accomplished quickly.
At the same time, we will change our immigration-screening procedures to help keep terrorists and extremists out of our country. [Applause] We have enough problems. Our country has enough problems. We don't need that one. And that includes stopping the influx of Syrian refugees. Incredibly, my opponent, Hillary Clinton, wants a 550% increase in refugees from that region.
Hard to believe. I, on the other hand, want to build a safe zone overseas and use the money saved to invest in America. [Applause] We do not want to let anyone in our country who doesn't support our values and who is not capable of loving our people. [Applause] It's time to create a new American future for you, your children, and all American children yet to come.
In this future, we will have an honest government that includes an honest State Department, not pay for play. She probably didn't mention that to you yesterday. Government access and favors will no longer be for sale and important email records will no longer be deleted and digitally altered, which is something they just found out two days ago.
Bleached, bleached. Expensive process. Why? Why? Thirty-three thousand emails bleached through a very expensive process. You ask yourself what's going on. We will also have an efficient and responsible federal budget no more waste, no more throwing away taxpayer dollars. Once more, we will have a government of by and for the people.
It will be -- It will be an inclusive society, one that offers hope and opportunity to every part of this country including our inner cities. We will ensure that every child in this land, including African-American and Hispanic children are put on the American ladder of success. Meaning, a great education and a great job, which they are not getting now.
[Applause] We will follow the noble example of our military men and women working selflessly across all different races and incomes and backgrounds to achieve unity and accomplish amazing things. You are amazing people. Just in case you didn't know that. OK. Amazing people. Ladies and gentlemen of the American Legion, I asked today for the honor of your vote.
Working in unison, we can deliver the real American change our country so desperately needs. We will make -- We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. We will make America great again. [Applause] Thank you very much and God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence, and hello Cincinnati. You know, I used to work in Cincinnati, and a place called Swifton Village. You know what that is? Swifton Village. It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right?
Look what happened. Look what happened. But I was watching the so-called debate last night, and I also watched the night before, that was long, long television, and the Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically. And this morning, that's all the fake news was talking about that.
That wasn't pretty. Now we're doing good, it's great to be back in this state that I love. I love this state, very special, very, very special, on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hardworking patriots of the American heartland. Thank you, Ohio. We love you Ohio. So we've got thousands of people standing outside, and I asked the officials, can we sneak some up along the aisles?
Can they sit on the stairs? But I'll tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout. We've sold tens of thousands of tickets, and you know what the sale price is, we keep it nice and low, we keep it nice and low. But there never has been a movement like this. This is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before, maybe anywhere, but certainly in this country.
They've never seen anything like this before. You came from the mountains, and the valleys, and the rivers, and you came for, I mean look, from wherever you came from, there were a lot of you, and they showed up on election day. I'll never forget, a wonderful congressman from Tennessee, they have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state Tennessee, and he said, he was in Pennsylvania with me, a great state, and he said you know, sir, I've been doing this for a long time, but I've never seen people like this show up for early voting, people that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for.
Said I've never seen it. They have Trump banners, and Trump hats, and Trump buttons that I've never seen. And this great congressman said, I don't know, sir, but I can tell you one thing, if the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting, you're going to win by a lot, and we won and we won by a lot. We won by a lot. Our nation is stronger today than ever before.
We have the number one economy on earth. No economy is so strong. Were rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military, and soon it will be stronger, relatively speaking, than at any time in our history, and when we took over, it was depleted. We took over a depleted military. It's not depleted anymore, I can tell you that. Our spirit is strong, our stride is back, and our stand is clear, we are finally putting America first.
About time. We've created six million new jobs since Election Day. Nobody would have thought that was possible. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, and they're happy, they're happy. 123,000 more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected, think of that number.
And right now, Ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country. Thank you. Congratulations. Ohio. Stand up Mike. And you have a good governor, I want to tell you that. Good job, Mike. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century, and unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded.
While Republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart. The Democrat Party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear. No one has paid a higher price for the far lefts destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation's inner cities.
They have paid a dear price, you see what's happening, you see our inner cities. We spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years, and it's stolen money, and it's wasted money, and it's a shame. For decades, these communities have been run exclusively by Democrat politicians, and it's been total one-party control of the inner cities. For a hundred years its been one-party control, and look at them.
We can name one after another, but I won't do that because I don't want to be controversial. We want no controversy. The Democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay, total decay. The Democrats have taxed and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities, and out of existence. They've squeezed the blood out of them. Left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice, trapping children and failing in government schools left and right.
So many of these mayors right now, you know what they are? They're in jail, that's where they are. Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice. But the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders, and these open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services, and flood communities with poisonous drugs.
It's tough enough, and I want to thank, by the way, the country of Mexico. They've got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now. I'm starting to like Mexico a lot. They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right? And the numbers are way down, you'll see that, way, way down. Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents.
They put foreign citizens before American citizens. We're not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year.
[Disturbance in audience]
You must have a Democrat mayor. You have a democrat mayor? Come on law enforcement. Democrat mayor.
[Disturbance in audience]
Cincinnati, do you have a Democrat mayor?
Well, that's what happens. You see, there are thousands of people outside, and I said, I agree. You know we set a new record tonight in this arena, but we could get, but we could get a few more on the floors, a few more up here, we could get, theyre outside where it's 100 degrees out, and they weren't able to let us go. And I said, is that run by the Democrats?
The answer is yes. I said oh. So you got a lot of hot people outside, but we broke the all-time record. So, the homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. I believe it's higher than, give me, give me a place that you think is pretty bad, give me a place. The guy says Afghanistan.
I believe it's higher than Afghanistan in our country. Think of that. I believe, we'll check the numbers and, if we're wrong, they will tell us tomorrow, it'll be headlines. Trump exaggerated. I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan, yet Democrats, and theyve run it for many years, want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants, instead of supporting their own struggling communities.
No good, no good. The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable. They're deplorable. You remember the word deplorable? You remember when Hillary used the word deplorable? She used two words. She used deplorable and irredeemable, right?
And only being a politician for a few years, I said, what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable. Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary. Crooked Hillary, she is a crooked one. Crooked. Crooked. She is crooked. Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California.
What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame. The world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions. Look at San Francisco. Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor, you have a governor that invites the whole world to come in to California, well pay for your health care, well pay for  And then you wonder why so many people are coming up. Theyre coming up because were the hottest economic country in the world, but they're also coming up, because you have people like that governor saying, come on up, we'll give you a health care, come. Who wouldn't come up? Who wouldn't come up? How crazy is this?
How crazy is this? Schools, health care. Today, I've a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration, and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. That's the way we should be doing it. Thats the way we should be doing it. And by the way, you know they keep talking about, oh the voters, the voters, the voters, they want all sorts of security.
What about a thing called voter ID, voter identification? Rob Portman, please work on that Rob Portman. You have a great senator. Would you please start working on that? You see the response. Every place I go. Rob, please Rob, voter ID. They give you everything they can give you, except like voter ID, and the things that matter.
Republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. Our pledge to America's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 million Americans for the jobs of tomorrow. You know he's working very hard on that? You probably never heard of her. Ivanka Trump. Shes working very hard. She gave up a lot.
She had a very easy life, but she loves doing it. She's got over, I think now, 12 million people. They're teaching them, the great companies of our country, they're teaching people how to do it, and it's an incredible thing to watch, to give former prisoners a second chance at life. We passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could have passed, except us. President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed.
I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives, and a lot of help, and the biggest beneficiary is the African-American community, biggest beneficiary. And something which a lot of people don't talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit, doubled it, and our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones, hottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment and job creation in distressed communities.
[Disturbance in audience]
You OK? Take your time. Take your time. Doctor? Is there a doctor in the house? OK, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Don't forget, it's 100 degrees in here. That person has been standing there for almost a day, if you think about it, a lot of you, so I appreciate it. And you know what? They'll come back, they'll get a little something, and they'll come right back, because there's never been anything like this. There's never been anything, right?
Thank you. Incredible. We established more than 300 Opportunity Zones in Ohio alone, and these are really working out incredibly well. Nationwide, nearly 8 million African-Americans live in Opportunity Zones, but every Democrat voted against them, every single Democrat, because they vote as a bloc. It's the only thing they do good.
They stick together. Their policys no good, they're lousy politicians, but they stick together like glue. That's the only thing they have going. Democrats deliver poverty for their constituents, and privilege for themselves. Republicans deliver job safety and opportunity for all Americans, and we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and we'll start off with a man who had a very, very tough race for governor.
A lot of people choke, they choke like dogs, they can't breathe. They can't breathe. This guy was running against a so-called star.
[Disturbance in audience]
So that's two protesters, and tomorrow night the headline will be, protesters, protesters. You know what happened to the second one? He looked at the guy in front of him, and he said, I'm out of here, bye. Thats the way it works. That's the way it works, I guess, too bad.
But a man who really has done a fantastic job. He campaigned so hard, and this was a star right from the fields of the great Pocahontas, who's now lying and cheating her way to the presidency, if possible. She's trying to win. Remember? She defrauded people with her credentials. She said she was Indian, and I said that I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none, I'm sorry. And we drove her crazy. And we drove her crazy.
That's a good thing, not a bad thing, and she went out, and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th. He said, somewhere back there, hundreds of years ago there may have been an Indian, or it may have been a statistical error, because it was so small, which it was. Anyway, but the guy was like from her group.
You wouldn't be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless. And I came in, we did a rally where we had people like this, it was packed the day before the election, and Mike DeWine won that election, and he won it easily, Mike DeWine. And we have a man who's running for governor of Kentucky again.
And he's done an incredible job, and you know, did you ever hear, sometimes you can do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it, but they had a lot of problems with pensions, and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct. But when you correct it, you make yourself a little bit less popular, but he had no choice, and they had no choice.
It's a great, great state, and he has turned out to be a great, great governor, Matt Bevin. And he's running in November, and because I like him so much, Matt, get a nice big arena ready, we're going to do a rally for you, OK? And a man whose fantastic son is here tonight, who I just met. Incredible.
When I ran with him, he was down. I said. you know, Rob Portmans down, and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points. I said, what the hell did you do? And you know what he did? He does a great job, that's what he did. Senator Rob Portman. Great guy. And we have a few guys that, these are warriors.
A couple of them you saw the other day. They were questioning Bob Mueller. That was a beauty. He was sharp, wasn't he? He was sharp as a tack. And Steve Chabot, and Brad Winship, and Warren Davidson, and Andy Barr, and a man named Greg Pence, who happens to be a brother of somebody I know very well, they have been with us through thick and thin, it's been mostly really good times
Because what we've done, no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done. Thank you, fellas, great job. A couple of them gave a grilling. They gave a grilling. All they had to do was mention the facts, and it was over. And also the auditor of the great state of Ohio, a man whose job I made much easier because you have money pouring in, you have companies pouring in, Keith Faber.
How is it Keith? The numbers are good, Keith, numbers are good right? Yeah, the numbers are good. Ohio Senate President Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you, great job, nice style, I like Larrys style. And you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful. I hear that office and I shudder. Ohio Supreme Court Justices, Sharon Kennedy and Judy French, thank you.
And please don't recuse yourself because I gave you a nice welcome should I ever be before you. I love judges when they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair, and then they say I'd like to recuse myself, because 29 years ago I met Donald Trump. I'd never have been in love.
You know we've been doing very well in the courts, by the way, have you seen whats  We've been winning a lot of cases, a lot of cases, we really have. We really have been. You know, we've now appointed 148, think of this, federal judges, 148. We're going to soon have, within about two months, Mitch McConnell, the Senate, Rob Portman has helped so much.
Well soon be, listen to this, 179, percentagewise, it's the second most, we will never beat number one, sadly, well never be number one, so percentagewise, nobody's ever seen anything like it, and that's because President Obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in, which is a shame. And I came in, I had 148 openings.
I said, youre supposed to have none, I said, how many do we have? 148. I said, you've got to be kidding, and we've all done a good job together, Rob, it's been amazing, with Mitch and you and everybody, it's been amazing. So we're going to be up to, within two months, 179 federal judges. That's in two and a half years. And what else? Two great Supreme Court judges. Great ones, and there's only one person, I think most of you must know this, who percentagewise has done better than me with judges, tell me?
Ill give you a hint. He appointed 100 percent of the federal judges and 100 percent of the United States Supreme Court. George Washington. That's one record we're not going to beat. But I appointed many more than him, so let's take it that way, many more. I also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job, she's really something.
She has been incredible as a leader of the GOP, she's the Chair, and she's my friend, Jane Timken. And a man Bob Paduchik, you know Bob Paduchik? So Bob, I had to pick a campaign manager, and I kept hearing from the media, you must win the state of Ohio. I heard this over and over for like a year and a half, you must win Ohio, you must win. So I had to pick a campaign manager, and I picked a man named Bob Paduchik, and no matter what happened, no matter how badly we were doing, he said, sir, you're going to win Ohio easily.
I said, but Bob, we just lost the head of the GOP in Ohio. He left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave. Great support from the governor, a different governor than Mike by the way, slightly. So he had to get out. So I said, we just lost and Bob said, don't worry about it, sir, you're going to win, in fact I think you just went up.
Then we lost a couple of other people. Id call them, Id say Bob, I'm worried about Ohio, very worried. He said, don't worry about it, sir, I think he just went up. He kept saying, you just went up. I said to somebody, I don't know much about this guy, but boy, he's the most optimistic person I've ever met.
And we, he said don't worry, we ended up winning Ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of, so he was right. Bob Paduchik. Bob. And also here tonight, I don't know, did he do a good job, my son, Donald Jr. and Kimberly? I hope he did a good job good. Good. I heard you did, I heard you did a great job. He's been a great help, they both have, and thank you very much.
Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you very much. Our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100 percent pro-American. We've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, giving the average American household $3,000 more to spend every single year. The previous administration tried to shut down American energy, and close up, totally close it up, American, clean, beautiful coal.
That's what they did. That didn't work out too well, but you had to suffer. You know what? It didn't work out well, but you yet to suffer for a long time until I came along. You're not suffering any longer. The previous administration, they liked windmills. You know, windmills. If a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless.
They make noise, they're intermittent, they kill your birds, they break down all the time. You have to replace them every 10 years, because they wear out. And they cost a fortune and they need subsidy. Other than that, they're quite good. You don't want to have them in. You don't want one of those windmills within vision.
You hear them, theyre noisy. Theyve got a lot of problems. No, we're going to stay with the great energy that's powering our businesses, that's creating so many jobs. And solar, you know what, we'll live with solar, but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need. But we're going to stay the way we have it. We've ended the war on American energy, and we're putting our coal miners back to work, and our steel workers back to work, and our auto companies back to work.
And you know, we've learned over the last three years the incredible gold that we're sitting on top of in this country, we're very lucky. We're now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than the Soviet Union, formally. Remember the Soviet Union when it was all together, the Soviet Union, when it was all together, before they decided we got to call ourselves Russia, when it was all together, they wanted to be, that was always their dream, to be the biggest in the world.
Then it became Russia, and you know what, they've done a good job with energy, and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy, but we're now bigger than Russia. We are now bigger than Saudi Arabia by far. And I withdrew our country from the job-killing very expensive Paris Climate Accord.
Last year, coal exports were up 92 percent compared to 2016, 92 percent, do you believe that? You're shipping it all over the world, to Vietnam. I was in Vietnam, and they said we get coal from Ohio, we get coal from West Virginia, it's the finest coal in the world. We've created more than 110,000 new mining jobs, and thanks to states like Ohio, the United States is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas, the number one everything having to do with energy, number one anywhere in the world.
We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs, plunder our factories, and devastate Ohio communities and communities in every state.
The era of economic surrender is over. When you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time, NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made, and probably the worst deal. You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now they're getting filled up pretty fast, they're being knocked down for brand new ones. We have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States.
My first week in office, I went through the United States from one of the last administration's worst sell outs. It would have destroyed our automobile industry. It would have destroyed manufacturing in this country, and maybe that's what President Obama meant when he said, you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States, because he would have signed Trans-Pacific Partnership and he would have been right.
I killed it. And by the way, TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country. Already they ship down 30 percent of your jobs to Mexico. Under the new USMCA, that's Mexico and Canada, we've got to get them to vote on that, because that's an incredible deal, but under the new  It's gonna be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down, to make their product whatever it may be, to send it back into the United States with no tax, al we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings. So theyve got to vote on the USMCA.
Before I took office, foreign countries ripped us off, robbed us blind, and pushed us around, but America is not being pushed around anymore. Do you realize that? I think I got that from working in Ohio for two summers, right? We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to Chinese trade abuse, and I just announced another 10 percent tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country, and that's on top of the 25 percent that we take of $250 billion coming in from China.
And don't let them tell you, the fact is, China devalues their currency,
they pour money into their system, they pour it in, and because they do that, you're not paying for those tariffs, China's paying for those tariffs. For the last 20 years, Chinas taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now we're stopping the theft of American jobs, we're stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property.
They steal our intellectual property. And you know, I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I'm not sure, because the word is, I feel, they want to wait till they get, oh they're praying, they're praying. They would like to see a new President in a year and a half, so they could continue to rip off the United States like they've been doing for the last 25 years.
They would love to see a guy like sleepy Joe Biden, who has no clue what the hell he's doing. They'd say to sleepy Joe, sir, just sign right there. Oh, OK, I'll sign. We've been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China, and it has to stop. They understand that. President Xi is a good man, he's a friend of mine.
He understands it, and until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China. That's all there is, OK? If foreign countries don't want to pay a tariff, I have a simple solution, make your product in America, come on back to the United States, come on back to Ohio, there's no tariff, there's no tariff.
Thanks to steel tariffs, hundreds of thousands of tons, think of this, were dumped on our shores, and steel is like something else, it's not quality, they were dumping garbage. They call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel, it was mixed up, it was bad stuff. And we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up buildings, but they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is United States Steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business, and I stopped it. I put on a 25 percent tariff.
Billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury, and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back. Right here in Ohio, Nucor, a great steel company, and a steel company that's doing great again, Nucor has announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a new $150 million steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights, and Cleveland-Cliffs announced a new $700 million plant in a very good place that I like a lot, Toledo, Toledo, Ohio. And this was unthinkable, because four years ago, steel plants were closing, they weren't expanding, and they weren't building. We're building new plants in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina, all over, not just Ohio.
On issue after issue, Democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent. They forgot. I wonder why they forgot. The job of elected officials is to represent American citizens. The radical democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets, sanctuary cities.
And many of the places that have sanctuary cities, and many of the people that live there, they don't want them, they don't want them. Theyre dangerous, they're not good. Here are just a few examples. In San Francisco, an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft. Yet each time, San Francisco defied federal authorities and set him free, and bad things happened when they set him free.
A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail. The very next month the same individual was arrested for rape, and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened, but yet again he was released back into your community. After a sanctuary city in New Jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people.
In the bizarre world view of the third and hard left, they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent Americans for a single, politically incorrect thought, but they want to virtually, and you know this, you know this, they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder, horrible crimes and murder. Republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And yes, we just won a big lawsuit last week.
In fact, one of my lawyers, for winning that lawsuit, is here tonight. I gave him a little reprieve. We need a lot of lawyers in the White House. We get sued so much, so unfairly, but we're winning those lawsuits left and right, but one of them is here. He said, I'd love to go to a rally. I said, I'm going to a place called Cincinnati, Ohio, you deserve it. We just won the lawsuit on the wall.
Wheres Pat. We just won the lawsuit on the wall, you hear that? And we're building the wall faster and better than ever. It's time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities, and catch and release. You know what do you, do you catch him and then you release him, and you say, would you please report back in four years from now. But only two percent come back.
You know why? Because they're not the smartest, they are not the smartest. They're, the ones we don't want to have come back. Only two percent show up. Catch and release. We could end it immediately if the Democrats gave, so what we're doing is something else, we're keeping them out altogether. We're replacing random migration, and we're replacing the lottery system.
How about the lottery system? How about lotteries? This was Chuck Schumer. You put the name in a basket. The country puts the name in the basket, and you pick people out of the lottery. Well, let's see this one's a murderer. This one robbed four banks. This one I'd better not say. This one, another murderer. Ladies and gentlemen, another murderer.
Think of this, do you think they are going to put their great citizens, they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people. Do you think those people are going into a lottery? No. And then we get these people coming in, and we hold it against the country. The country isnt based on that, the country, you just take a look, look at the people they put into these lotteries.
It's a disgrace. And how we've done this for so many years, folks, how we've done this. It's an immigration system, that's totally broken and we're going to win the House, we're going to win the Senate, we're going to win the presidency, and we're going to do a merit-based immigration system. Merit based. Merit-based immigration, and we need that, because we have companies coming in from all over the world, and we need good workers, we need good people.
We're down to 3.5 percent unemployment. We need people, but we want people to come in based on merit, not based on some lottery put in by a government. Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private health care and force everyone onto the government plan.
Remember the lies from the previous administration, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, 28 times, one lie after another, 28 times it was said, and it turned out to be a total lie. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you.
We're offering right now plans up to 60 percent cheaper than Obamacare, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always, always. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion. And then you'll have like a governor of Virginia, it's not only late-term abortion, it's killing the baby after the baby is born.
How about that? Think of that, think of that. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion and they're the party, frankly, of socialism.
The Republican Party is the party of freedom. We're the party of the American worker, the American family, we're the party of the American dream. I'm fighting for you each and every day. I had a great life. I used to get great publicity. Nobody got better publicity. I had such a great life. It was so easy.
My great wife, the first lady Melania, she said, she said you know, you've always been a hard worker, you love to work, but your life was a lot easier in the old days. But I love it, and you know I love it? Because we're accomplishing so much, nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things were doing. Even a thing like Right-to-Try, right? Right-to-Try. They've been trying to get that for years and years and years.
That's people that are really sick, terminally ill. They couldn't get medicine. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest clinics, the greatest technicians in the world. They couldn't get anything. Theyd travel to Asia if they had money, theyd travel to Europe, theyd travel all over the world hoping for a cure.
If they had no money, theyd just go home, theyd die. They had no hope. For 44 years they've been trying to get Right-to-Try. We are so advanced in medicine. We have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick. You know why? Because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people, but the people were terminally ill. So I got it approved, and it wasn't easy, it was complicated.
The insurance companies didn't want to do it. The government didn't want to do it. The doctors didn't want to do it, tremendous liability, but our country didn't want to do it. They said well, if it doesn't work, we're going to get sued. I say, so they'll sign an agreement, very strong, one page, taking all liability away from the United States, from the drug companies, from the doctors, all liability, theyre terminally ill, lets try it.
And you know what, it's been a miracle, so many people have done so well. We got it done. When I said about the agreement, they had these great lawyers, and they said gee, that's a good idea. They've been working on this for years. They said, that's a good idea. I said yes, it's a good idea. How about getting it to me like it about two hours. Right-to-Try, it's a great thing, but we have so many things like that.
I have lists that you wouldn't even believe. I have lists that go on for pages of things we've done. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries. It's a very unfair system. Our country pays the highest prices in the world. Last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down.
Now we're going to bring it down by a lot. We're going to bring it down a lot, and now, so other countries  Here's an example. Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs than we do. So we have a great governor in the state of Florida, Ron DeSantis, calls me up, doing a great job, Ron DeSantis, he was at three and he went to 70. That's a pretty good increase, right? Ron DeSantis is a great governor.
And he comes to me, and he goes, you know, if you buy the drugs, if we buy the drugs, because this is so botched up, we have a middleman, it's a, it's not a good situation. He said, if I could go and buy the drugs from Canada, I could save 50 percent. I said, do it, do it, and if you can buy it from Europe, because their system, like remember, I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to, and I'd say, the system is rigged? Well, the drug system is rigged, it's rigged. So if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from Europe, or from Canada, or from other places at a big deep discount, we're doing it, and we're giving them the right to do it. Just happened today. And we're doing one other thing that, believe it or not, is even bigger, but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks.
With the help of your great senator Rob Portman, we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic, and in Ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22 percent last year, 22 percent. But think of that, opioid, big problem, big problem, deaths went down, opioid deaths, 22 percent. Nobody writes that, nobody talks about that.
They don't want to talk about that. Good job, Rob, good job. Good job Mike. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. They've been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades. They couldn't get it done. We got it done, we got it done. This is where a veteran would stand on line for three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks. Sometimes they're OK by the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill. And I said, you know, I have a great idea, because I've not doing that this long, you know, this has been, we've been working to this for, I've been thinking about it a lot.
This was during the campaign. What a campaign that was, right? Was that a campaign or what? And I came back to my people, I had experts, and I said, I have a great idea. These lines for the veterans are too long. It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor.
I have a great idea, let's let them go outside, go to a private doctor, well pay the bill, they'll be fixed up all perfect, and they can do it immediately. We'll pay the bill. And I thought, I said, man am I smart. I am the smartest guy to think of that. So I went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things, and I said, how do you like that idea. And they said, sir, we've known about it for about 40 years, but we've never been able  I said really, you've known about it that long, but here's the thing, we got it done, nobody else could get it done. Nobody.
And Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody. If they were treating our vets badly, you couldn't fire him for anything. People could steal, they could be sadistic to our vets. By the way they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets, I can tell you that, they can be whatever they want, you couldn't fire them.
And it was because of unions, and it was because of other things, civil service, very tough. You couldn't fire anybody for almost anything. We had cases where people got, they got caught stealing a lot of money, and you couldn't fire them. We got VA Accountability, now we say Jim, get the hell out of here, youre fired.
We're rebuilding our military, and after years of budget cuts and layoffs, the Army tank plant in  You know Lima? You call it Lima, right? You know, most people call it Lima, but I know Lima, you know why? Because I came here, and they said we're closing this plant. I said, what kind of a plant is it? Remember when I was here? In Lima, and I used to say you mean Lima, they said, no sir, its Lima, that's why.
Because hey, look, I'll be honest with you, because they have it wrong on the teleprompter, OK, and I would have been in big trouble. But the good news is I don't use the teleprompter too much. If I did, you would have been out of here a long time ago, because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal. But in Lima, and I said What kind of a plant, and I said, let's go see it.
During the campaign I went to see it, and they make the incredible, the best army tank in the world, and I couldn't believe the complexity, the genius. I said, wait a minute. You close this, you'll never be able to open it again. You can't open this. This isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof. This is complicated.
This is genius, and you'll never replace these men and women that work here. I said, and I didn't know anything at the time other than I said, you're not closing it. They took it off the list, they kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock. We're investing in the future of human spaceflight.
Americans won the race to the moon, and we will now win the race to Mars. It's gonna be amazing, and you know, one thing I have to say also, and we're also winning the race to great, great, strategic defense and offense, not just Mars. And Mike Pence is doing a great job on that, great job. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, a horrible stupid deal.
We gave Iran a $150 billion. We gave Iran $1.8 billion in cash, planeloads of cash. I wonder what they saw when those planes landed? I wonder what happened to the cash? Can you believe it? $1.8 billion we gave them in cash. And remember what I said, Iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago. When I took over Iran, was all over. They had that 14 to 18 different sites of confliction.
They were all over, and now they just want to, oh they want a negotiated deal so badly. Iran. Iran. I recognized Israel's true capital, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just a few months ago, we recognized the Golan Heights, you know that. That's another one, big one for the security of Israel.
We also recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela, and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place. Let's see what happens there. Let's see what happens. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country, never ever ever will it be a socialist country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism, and the destruction of our great, our beautiful, our wonderful American dream.
We're not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing, it's about you. I say it again, I say it all the time, never happened before. There's never been a movement like this. They've had movements, they never went  They won a state, they did well in a state.
We won 32 states, there's never been anything like it. There's never been anything like it. But this movement is about your family and your future, and it's about the life and the faith of your country. We begin our Ohio, hey, look, this is a good place, is this a great thing to do? We begin our campaign, and we're going to do great Bob, right Bob?
Bob, if we don't do great, you're fired, Bob, you're fired. But think of it, our Ohio campaign, with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future, and again, remember this, Ohio is doing better today than it's ever, ever, ever done before. It's the best it's ever done.
So, what's he going to do, a guy like sleepy Joe Biden is going to come in and say, but I can do better, I can do better. He wants to go back to sleep. Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise, so every American can reach their fullest and highest potential, tremendous potential.
Our country has such tremendous potential. You know, we've had the last week, we've had the highest stock market in the history of our country. That means 401(k)s, that means jobs. But there's tremendous potential to go up. We have tremendous potential to go up. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration.
We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words, made in the USA, or made in America, either one, you can use either one. Made in America, made in the US. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, and I see what they're doing. I see it. They show me. the things we're doing in our country today, there's never been anything like it.
We will be ending the AIDS epidemic shortly in America, and curing childhood cancer very shortly. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. And just remember, with the Democrats, there is no second amendment. You can forget about keep and bear arms, you can forget it.
Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We will never ever stop fighting. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work, and we believe in the sanctity of life, and we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way.
We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history and always be proud, patriotic Americans. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust. Two days ago I spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at Jamestown, Virginia. It was beautiful.
It was incredible. I was, I must tell you, I was reminded of so many great things in our country. We have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage. We are the greatest republic on the face of the earth, and we are going to keep it that way. Every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans, and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you.
The future belongs to the greatest movement in the history of our country. With your help, and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one people and one family, saluting one great American flag.
We all share the same home, we all share the same heart, and we all share the same love of Almighty God. Together with the great and proud people of Ohio, we are making America wealthy again. We are making America strong again. We are making America safe again. We are making America great again, and with your vote in 2020, we will keep America great. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you.
There is something going on, Ohio, that they're not talking about. There's something going on. You look at this gigantic room and there are many more people outside trying to get in. Should we let them in or not? The problem is we don't have the room to let them in. Thousands of people outside, there is something going on. There's an electricity like people have not seen since a date 2016 November.
A lot of things are going on. Get out and vote. Hello, Ohio. I love Ohio. Remember I heard it over and over again -- you cannot win, right? You cannot win, everything goes through Ohio. You cannot win without the great state of Ohio, so we won Ohio easily, easily. We won Ohio together and we won the whole thing and I'm thrilled to be in Cleveland, Ohio, where we had a wonderful convention.
And I'm with thousands of hardworking, great, great American patriots. Thank you for being here, we appreciate it. This is our final day, two stops after this. I did a lot of stops, I saw a lot of people. I saw a lot of Make America Great Again hats, a lot of hats. I saw a lot of spirit, I saw a lot of spirit like this country hasn't seen.
We have -- what we've done -- this is the greatest political movement of all time in this country. And it's an incredible time in America -- jobs are soaring, wages are rising, poverty is plummeting and more Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our nation. Think of that. How do we lose that -- how do we lose that in a debate?
More people are working today than ever before, somehow whenever they do pick their far left candidate, I think we're going to do OK. We have a lot of good soundbites. Our military is stronger than ever, we have a lot of great, great soundbites. Tomorrow the people of Ohio are going to elect Mike DeWine and a Republican Congress to keep America's economic boom surging full speed ahead.
Mike DeWine, boy he is fighting, he's great. And I know his opponent, he's a disaster. I -- look, I'm just -- you know, there are some Democrats, they're fine. This guy Cordray is a bad guy, he's not a good person, he's hurt a lot of people. What he's done to people is a disgrace, and I hope he loses for two reasons.
Number one, Mike DeWine is a -- he's going to be a great Governor, and Cordray a bad person who will do a terrible job, OK. Now that I have that out of my system, let's go back. It's true, it's true, he's a bad person. Republicans have -- we actually essentially fired him, so I -- mean -- I know a lot about him.
You're fired. Republicans have created the best economy in the history of our country and the hottest jobs market -- well, look, you take a look. Take a look what's happened. This is the hottest place economically anywhere in the world right now. When I have some wonderful leaders of countries -- Presidents, Prime Ministers, Kings, Queens, some dictators but we don't mention that... the first thing they say to me is congratulations, Mr. President, you have the hottest economic nation anywhere in the world, congratulations.
And Ohio sees it just about better than anybody because you see the car companies back, the car companies expanding, other companies are coming back. Remember, they were all leaving, now they're all coming back, folks. They're all coming back. Just like I said, but I did mislead you in one way and I apologize.
I didn't know we could do it this fast, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't know we could do it this quickly. It's gone very quickly. If I would have said that out on the campaign trail, I would have been greeted with the worst headlines. They would have said how dare he make those statements. But what we've done in less than two years, no President or administration in its first two years has done anywhere near what this administration has done and they know it -- and they know it. But everything we have created and achieved is at stake on Election Day, it is. If the radical Democrats take power, they will take a wrecking ball to our economy and to our future -- a wrecking ball.
When you enter the voting booth on Tuesday, you will be making a simple choice -- a vote for Republicans is a vote to continue our extraordinary prosperity, our extraordinary journey together. It's a journey that we made together -- not me, all of us together. A vote for Democrats is a vote to bring this economic boom crashing to a sudden halt.
The Democrat agenda is a socialist nightmare for our country. The Republican agenda is the American dream, and that's what we're doing, we're bringing back the American dream. In the last month alone, we added 250,000 jobs -- and this is -- these are beautiful, brand new, spanking new jobs in the month of October.
We brought back nearly half a million people, and we brought them into the work force and they are so happy. The unemployment rate is the lowest level in 50 years. You saw on Friday, you saw the numbers were announced -- those numbers were announced. Good timing with all those great economic numbers that came out.
Do you think the media wanted to maybe delay them to Wednesday? Would you say they would have been happy? They would have been happy if they could have delayed them, announced the numbers the day after the election. No, they came out at a good time. Friday numbers, those were phenomenal numbers. You haven't seen numbers like that in a long time, many years.
We've created 4.5 million new jobs since election day... and we have lifted 4.3 million Americans off of food stamps. African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels in history. Jobless claims in Ohio have fallen to their lowest level ever recorded. We're bringing the jobs all bad.
They're coming back. A lot of them are coming back to Ohio. We sort of tell them, "hey, how about Ohio? How about going to Ohio? Household income for Ohio families has reached the highest level in the history of your state, and we have put your coal miners and your steel workers back to work. We passed a massive tax cut, massive for Ohio workers, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.
We got to win the House to do that, by the way. Just put it in your heads. Put it into your heads when you're getting ready to vote, while you're voting. Who has already voted? Oh, so this is very much a Tuesday state. I found that with mine. I remember they said, "well, the people are sort of holding for Tuesday," and did you show up on Tuesday.
So ready? Who is going to vote on Tuesday? OK. Don't forget. Don't forget. You know, the midterm elections used to be like boring, didn't they? Do you even remember what they were? People would say midterms. They say, "what is that? What is it," right? Now it's like the hottest thing. These guys are making a fortune because of me and you.
But it's true. It's true. I mean, whoever even heard of midterms? I don't even know what it is. I've had a lot of people say, "I don't know what midterm is, but now I'm watching every single minute and I'm going out to vote." But the key is you have to go out to vote because in a sense I am on the ticket.
You got to go out to vote. And you have to protect your rights and your freedoms. We overcame the Democrat's smear campaign and confirmed the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The contrast in this election could not be more clear. Democrats produce mobs. Republicans produce jobs.
If crying Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and... and a legendary Maxine Waters... gained a majority, they will try to raise your taxes, restore job killing regulations, shutdown your coal mines and your steel mills. That's what's going to happen. Take away your healthcare. Your healthcare, you could forget it. You're going to live in a socialist world, and put illegal aliens before American citizens.
The people of Ohio are not too happy. Not too happy. I know Ohio well. I don't know if you know I used to work in Ohio for summers with my father on a job we had. Cincinnati, Ohio. I worked for a couple of summers, and I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. And I won't tell you, but I used to -- I shouldn't say that in this room, but I on occasion would be known to sneak into Kentucky because I liked Kentucky.
I like Kentucky for all the wrong reasons, but I like Kentucky. I liked it. I had a good time in Cincinnati, Ohio. I learned a lot. I learned a lot in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I love Ohio. Maybe that's why we won it by so much, remember? Everything goes through Ohio. I love the people of Ohio. The Democrat platform is a 2018 socialism, open borders edict.
Democrats are inviting caravan after caravan -- isn't that nice -- of illegal aliens to flood into our country and overwhelm your communities. That's what's happened. Have you seen the pictures? And they try and play it down like it's not that many. It's not that many people. You know, you're looking at a bridge with thousands and thousands.
We're building the wall, though. We're building the wall. Don't worry. We've already started. $1.6 billion, we've already started. Yes, we've started. We want to do it at one time. Although, barbed wire looks like it's going to be very effective, too. With soldiers standing in front of it. By the way, how good does our military look?
Doesn't it look good? If you want more caravans and more crime, vote Democrat. If you want strong borders and safe communities, vote Republican. Now, I have no idea where they are in this incredible room. I don't know. Maybe they're outside. They got stuck outside with a lot of people, but we are thrilled to be joined today by many terrific Ohio Republican members of Congress.
Here's a guy I love because he's a champion. Years, the NCAA champion in wrestling, his record is crazy like 128 and one -- some crazy record. And you know why? Not because of just the muscle. It's because of this right here, because of this. This muscle, that's your most important right here. Lot of strong people, but if you don't have this it doesn't matter.
Congressman Jim Jordan, where is he? He's a champ. I love him defending me on television, he is a bulldog. He doesn't give a damn -- boom, boom, boom, point after point. Right? He's a champ. Say something.
Thank you. The -- the -- love you, too. So the -- the President -- the President is exactly right, the choice tomorrow could not be more clear. The left has gone completely crazy, they applaud Kaepernick when he disrespects the flag, they cheer on Governor Cuomo when he says America was never that great and they embrace Maxine Waters when she says go out and harass anyone who supports our President.
Contrast that -- contrast that with the record in the 21 months under the President's leadership. Regulations -- regulations reduced, taxes cut, economy growing at four percent, lowest unemployment in 50 years, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh all in the court, out of that crazy Iran deal, the -- the embassy's in Jerusalem, the hostages are home from North Korea and oh by the way, there's a new NAFTA agreement.
That is the choice tomorrow. Go vote Republican tomorrow. God bless you all, thank you Mr. President.
Thank you, Jim. Champion -- he's a champion. One of the greats. He's one of the best. Congressman Bill Johnson -- Bill... These are great people -- these are great people. They help us so much with so many -- including the tax cuts and regulations and we wouldn't get by without them. It's Ohio. Congressman Bob Gibbs -- Bob... Great guy.
Congressman Warren Davidson... Dave Joyce, where is Dave? Thank you Dave, great job. They do -- these are great people. And our Republican nominee for Ohio's 16th Congressional District, you know him very well, Anthony Gonzalez. I hear his poll numbers are looking very good, is that right fellas? Looking good, it's looking good?
I hear it's looking good. And also, a special person -- and he was going to make his way up, I said do this, don't even think about it, just keep campaigning because he's doing fantastic. He's only been there for a short while, Troy Balderson, he's respected by everybody, Troy Balderson. Troy is in there working, I said just stay there and campaign.
Don't take any chances. Troy Balderson, vote for him. If you don't want to be saying the words Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi for the next two years, get out and vote for a Republican House, so important. And we're also grateful to be joined by somebody who's really worked hard -- his whole life he's worked hard, he gets it. He's a wonderful human being, he's strong, he's tough, he doesn't take no for an answer, he's run I hear a really good campaign, not easy.
It's not easy, nothing's easy, but he is somebody that -- he gets it and you're going to be so happy. You're going to be so happy, so thrilled -- hopefully your next Senator Jim Renacci.
Well thank you, Mr. President. Listen, it was just two years ago that I welcomed you here at the Ag Center -- it was Mr. Trump at that time, and look at what he's done for Ohio -- look at what he's done for Ohio. Look, the Buckeye State loves you, we love what you're doing -- jobs growing, economy's up, unemployment down, wages are up, and Sherrod Brown's going to be gone tomorrow.
So again, thank you all, we've been fighting. The polls are narrowing, we got a good poll today, shows we've crossed over and we're winning. Let's make it happen tomorrow, get out and vote, thank you.
He's a fighter, he's a fighter, real fighter. Be a tremendous Senator. Now, I don't know -- they'll say this is nepotism, but the truth is she's a very, very -- you're not allowed to use the word beautiful anymore when you talk about women, you're not allowed, no no. It's -- it's politically incorrect. No no, it's politically -- I will never call a woman beautiful again, and every man here -- every man here, raise your hand, you will never, ever say your wife, your girlfriend, anybody is beautiful, right?
So I'm not allowed to say it because -- because it's my daughter Ivanka, but she's really smart and she's here. Should I bring her up? Come on. Ivanka, come up.
Wow, wow. Hi, Ohio. That was some introduction. It is always, always, always an honor to be here and I am so proud what we're all here fighting for. This President, my father, promised that he would fight to give you all a voice. He promised that he would fight for the forgotten men and women of America and he is fighting hard.
I see it every single day, and the fight is paying off. Wages are rising, unemployment is at historic low rates across almost every single category, people are coming off the sidelines and back into the economy and realizing the opportunity of the American dream. In October alone, 250,000 people entered the work force.
Incredible. So what tomorrow is all about is keeping that going. This is the golden era of economic opportunity, of prosperity and of security, and that's what we're all fighting for. Thank you for having me here, thank you Ohio, we love you.
OK, all right. I never said she was beautiful, but she was smart. I'll tell you what, always like a great student -- always a great student. And I remember when she graduated from the Wharton School of Finance, some of her classmates came up and said -- I don't know if I like this, they said Mr. Trump, she doesn't even try and she gets good marks, she gets these great marks.
And there's something OK about that, too, but she has been a wonderful daughter, I have to tell you. She's been a wonderful, wonderful daughter, and her big thing is creating jobs in our country. She's done it so much. She goes all over, she meets with companies, she's creating five, six million -- workforce, where they're training people that have never done this, and I think they're up to almost six million people right now being trained by the companies, cause the companies can do it better than the government, right?
And it's more specific. So she has been incredible. Thank you, Ivanka. Finally, tomorrow the people of Ohio are going to elect an outstanding new Governor and Lieutenant Governor. They got together, they were smart. That was pretty smart, right? They got together, they went head-to-head, and then all of a sudden they got together.
How smart, we should see more of that in this country, shouldn't we? Think of it. Mike DeWine and Jon Husted, they got together, the two top candidates, they called it a merger. Mike DeWine has spent his entire life fighting for Ohio families. He loves this state. He will keep your jobs going way up, and you know what?
I'll work hard either way, but it helps when you have a Governor who somebody likes that happens to be President, don't you think? You know? Maybe you take his call instead of not taking his call when they need help for something and we help a lot. But he's working on your taxes and always -- he wants those taxes to go way down, and they will be because we have so much business coming in. And he will always support our brave military.
He loves our veterans, he loves our military and he loves our law enforcement. Mike's opponent, who was in my administration for a short while, who was by the way terrible -- terrible, is a far left radical socialist named Richard Cordray, and not a good person. He was hand-picked and he's a disciple of Elizabeth Warren, who I can no longer call Pocahontas because she has no Indian blood.
She has no Indian blood. I used to go around saying I have more Indian blood than you do, and I have none, and I was right. I mean the only bad thing about that is that I can't really, legitimately call her Pocahontas anymore because the press will say I'm misrepresenting, right? OK, OK, I'll call her Pocahontas anyway, right?
We won't give up that name. That name is -- that name is too good to give up. It's too good. But this Cordray guy literally -- she grabbed him and put him there -- spent the last six years in Washington crushing people, crushing community banks, destroying small businesses and destroying jobs. He also, in a big scandal, spent nearly $250 million of federal money to renovate a headquarters agency that the government doesn't even own.
It's a lease. And more than twice what the entire building was worth, and the escalators or the elevators, I hear, cost -- they're the most expensive elevators in the history of the world, let's put it that way. They're the most expensive elevators. I heard the price. I said, "That doesn't sound right." Now, Cordray wants to bring his socialist, job-killing crusade, and destroy the state of Ohio.
Cordray's anti-worker -- and he is anti-worker, and he's anti-business -- extremism will drive your state into poverty. And we have another one like this in the state of Florida. I don't even know if he's as bad as Cordray, you want to know the truth. He just doesn't know what the hell he's doing. This one does.
And he's going to drive your taxes right through the roof. Cordray will destroy Ohio, and destroy its miners and its steelworkers, and everybody else. Mark my words. I hope I don't have to come back, because that means a bad thing happened tomorrow. If you want a safe and prosperous future for Ohio, vote for Mike DeWine.
Come on up, Mike. Come on up. [Audience Chants USA]
Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, first of all, thank you for being back in Ohio. I am very grateful for your support, and I'm also very grateful, as we all are, for 82 conservative federal judges that are now on the bench. I'm told that there are 30 more coming that will be confirmed in not-too-distant future.
That is an amazing legacy, Mr. President. This race -- I need your help tomorrow. This race is about whether we go back, or whether we go forward. Richard Cordray and Ted Strickland took us back. Eight years ago, we lost over 400,000 jobs. We've regained those jobs today. We've added 150,000 more and, Mr. President, statistic that came out last week showed because of good Republican leadership and your tax cut, Ohio had its best year in growing jobs in 21 years.
So my wife, Fran, and I, John Houston and Tina, we will continue to work until the polls close at 7:30 tomorrow night. Help us get this victory to keep Ohio growing, to keep Ohio moving onward. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mike. He's a good man. I just say that's a good man who loves you and he's going to take good care. If Democrats gained power on Tuesday, one of their very first projects will be a socialist takeover of American healthcare. You know that. That's why the countries that have those plans, whenever somebody has a couple of bucks in their pocket gets sick, they come to the United States to have the operation or to get better.
The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare advantage for almost 900,000 Ohio seniors who depend on it. Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and, by the way, who paid for it. They paid for it. And Republicans will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always, always.
Democrats plan to destroy healthcare, also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants. How do you like that Ohio? Does Ohio like that? I don't think so. We know the people of Ohio too well. As we speak, Democrats are open encouraging millions of illegal aliens to violate our law and break into our country, and they want to sign them up for free welfare, free healthcare, free education, and, of course, the right to vote, the right to vote! And it's the right to vote that they like the best.
They want them to be able to vote. There's only one way to end this lawless assault on our dignity, our sovereignty, and on our borders, and that's by voting tomorrow Republican. Illegal immigration costs our country more than $100 billion every single year, and that's more than the budget of Ohio, Montana, and Wyoming combined, all places I've been.
We have great races in those places. I think you're going to see some very good results. Not only do the Democrat's open border policies drain our Treasury, but they endanger every American community and endanger them like you wouldn't believe. Nearly 100 percent of the heroin coming into the United States enters through the southern border along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, the majority of meth, and a substantial portion of deadly fentanyl.
These drugs kill more than 70,000 Americans a year, destroy hundreds of thousands of lives, and by the way, Ohio knows it better than almost any other state in the union. Last year alone, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 127,000 -- think of that. This is -- they want to fire them. They don't want ICE.
Even Jim Jordan would be afraid of some of these ICE people, right? Maybe not. No, no. He's not -- he's not a good example, but maybe. But they're tough and they're strong and they're patriots like him. But they're patriots. So listen to this 127,000 aliens with criminal records were thrown out last year or put in prison by ICE who else is going to do that?
Who else? Including those charged or convicted of approximately 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes, and 1,800 homicides. Other than that, you know, they're very nice people, very nice people. Other than that, they're very fine people. Hey, by the way, you think we're letting that caravan come into this country, you can forget it. But the Democrats want to abolish ICE.
They want America to be a giant sanctuary city for drug dealers, predators, and blood thirsty MS-13 killers. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law biding Americans, not criminal aliens. Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE, border patrol, and your great law enforcement, and you really do have great law enforcement in this state.
Thank you all. Thank you. This election is about safety and this election is about prosperity. For years you watched as we let foreign countries plunder our wealth, shutter our factories, and steal our jobs like we're babies -- like we're little babies. But those days are over, Ohio. Because as everybody is seeing and as everybody is pointing out even to them back there, America is respected again.
America is respected. We've added nearly half a million manufacturing jobs since the election. Last month alone, we added another 32,000 manufacturing jobs. One month -- that's 1,000 new manufacturing jobs every single day. And you remember the previous administration -- I'm being nice. The previous administration said manufacturing jobs will never come back to this country, right?
And I used to say, "what does he mean by that one?" They're never coming back. He said you'd need a magic wand. Well, we found the magic wand. We found it. I recently announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal, one of the worst trade deals every made in the history of the world, with and incredible, brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement.
It's all done. The USMCA is a giant victory for Ohio farmers and factory workers, a giant victory, a giant victory. You're not going to have your companies leaving anymore, firing everybody, moving to Mexico or Canada, sending their product in here tax free. We end up with empty factories and no jobs. That's not happening anymore.
We have taken historic action to bring back American jobs by cracking down on China's very abusive, very unfair trade practices, and we are doing very well I want to tell you. They want to make a deal and that could happen. That could happen. You know, we're right now taxing them on $250 billion worth of goods that they're sending to us. They're not happy, but they want to make a deal.
Could -- really it could go much higher. We could add another two -- I guess we could add another -- I won't even say it. You know what it'll be a big story if I say it. Should I say it? I'm not going to say it. If I say it, it's a big story. If we say it, it's a big story. All right, let's put it this way.
It's a lot of money left, but you know what? I have a great relationship with President Xi of China, and I think we have a real good chance of working something out that's a great deal for us and works for everybody. And if we don't, I'll be honest. I'm extremely happy with our position, extremely. After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country and we are doing it with American steel and American aluminum.
Thanks to our tariffs and taxes and trade policies which are tough, American steel mills are roaring back to life. Do you see it? Do you believe it? It's one of the biggest business stories. They don't like to report it, but these are minor details. I'm reporting it, OK? They're roaring back to life. They were dead.
The steel industry was very close to being over the cliff dead. It was hanging on by a thread -- by a whisker, and they are coming back. It's one of the really great business stories of the year because I stopped and I tax the dumping of garbage steel that they're dumping all over our country, putting our steel mills out of business.
And we're going to get the iron ore and the miners are going to get it for them, and it's going to come from places like Minnesota where they have the finest in the world, and it's going to come down into Ohio and so many other places because right here in Ohio, Nucor -- great company, big, big, but steel was going the wrong way -- has just announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion.
Charter Steel announced a new $150 million steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights. JSW Steel -- by the way, you know this is sort of a [Inaudible] because you haven't had an announcement like this is 25 years, 30 years, and some cases it's brand new. They're not even doing the renovation deal. They're doing brand new.
JSW Steel is restarting the furnace and investing $500 million in Mingo Junction. And by the way, this is just what's happening to Ohio. This is going on all over the country. And Cleveland-Cliffs announced a new $700 million plant going to start right away in Toledo, Ohio. Toledo. Pretty amazing. Everyday is promises made, promises kept.
That's what it is. Promises made, promises kept. You know, I've actually kept more promises than I've made. When did you ever hear that from a politician? Maybe never. Never. So I've done things that we never even talked about on the campaign. Many, many things. We've also taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs.
You see what's going on. And Pfizer and Novartis and a lot of the big companies agreed to reduce their prices after I cut. I called them up and they were great. They were great. They reduced their prices! Did you ever hear what president calls a drug company, "I'd like you to reduce your prices to [Inaudible]." You think Hillary would do that?
I don't think so. I don't think so. We have just introduced new affordable healthcare plans that are really incredible, lower priced than this horrible Obamacare, which we really have decimated and kept your premiums down by doing it, and we got rid of the individual mandate that costs nearly 60 percent.
You have to see this. The individual mandate -- how many people are happy that we cut out the individual mandate? The worst part of Obamacare, and we're working very hard. We're going to be the ones that solve the healthcare. We have already come close to doing it. We passed Veterans Choice giving our veterans the right to see a doctor... a private doctor right down the road instead of waiting for two, three, four weeks, instead of waiting for two months.
What happened was horrible. And now you see a private doctor, we pay for the costs of that private doctor, and our veterans are taken care of immediately. They don't have to wait in line. They've been trying to do that for over 40 years. I though it was my idea until I went back. I said, "I have a great idea.
We're going to have private doctors take care of our vets because they can't wait three, four, five weeks." And my people said, "sir, we've been trying to do that for 40 years." I said, "you know what? I'm good at getting approvals. Let's go get it." And we got it! We got it. Right? We got it. Our vets are being taken care of first time.
They don't have to wait in line. If they see a wait, they go run down to that doctor. You know, it's interesting. We save -- it's so unimportant compared to taking care of our vets -- but secondarily, we save a lot of money. We save a lot of money because we have vets that go in and they're not badly ill, not badly -- not a big problem.
It takes so long to see a doctor they end up being terminally ill and it's a horrible thing. Now they take care of it right away. I love it. And we also passed the VA Accountability Law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans can be held accountable. You're fired! Get out! Get out! We secured $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States Military stronger than it's ever been before.
And thanks to our $2 billion investment in new armored vehicle workers at the legendary tank plant in Lima -- Lima, Ohio. Where are they? Do you have any of those? They're very happy people. Where are they? Yes. They're very happy. Lima, Ohio are now back on the job churning out the best tank anywhere in the world, the M1 Abrams tank, so the best anywhere in the world, best in the world.
At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, called the Space Force. Very important. And I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. We have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
And it wasn't supposed to be built, they thought, for 20 years. But I got it built in three months so we saved $1 billion, OK. It's already open. We took a building already located in one of our sights, which we had for nothing, we renovated it, it costs $500,000 or less. And we have a beautiful embassy.
It was supposed to cost $1.1 billion. I think it's better, because the location we have is better than the location we had to buy for a fortune. So anyway, little things, little things. That's called real estate, right. It's already open, it's already open. Together, we have made extraordinary progress, and we are just getting started.
This is the greatest political movement in the history of our country, and it's your movement. It's all of us together. It's your movement, not mine. It's your movement. And you got to keep the movement going tomorrow, because if we don't do reasonably well -- you know we're at a disadvantage because they say that two times in many, many, many years, they had positive results, whoever's in the White House, for whatever reason.
But nobody in the White House has ever had the greatest economy in the history of our country. Nobody's had that, right. So it should be different. And look at the people in this room and the thousands that are outside that are watching this on screens. You know, this is a happening. Something's going on. I really look forward -- I really look forward to seeing it. And there are a couple of honest polls that are showing some very, very good promise tomorrow.
So let's see what happens tomorrow, but we have to keep it going. Two years ago, we shocked the Washington establishment and stunned the world, when we defied the pundits and the critics, we rejected them and the failures of the corrupt status quo and elected government that finally put -- we are now doing it. We're putting America first.
It's very simple, putting America first. America first. [Audience Chants USA] And every day since the failed old ruling class have been trying to claw their way back into power, our political opponents have been on a relentless campaign of obstruction, resisting, demolishing, defaming and trying to destroy.
They're not doing too well. They're not doing too well, and we're not going to let them do too well. These are corrupt people. Tuesday is your chance to send a message to the Democrat mob and to everyone who has made it their mission to denigrate our movement and to divide our great nation. Not going to happen.
Tomorrow, with your votes, you can stop the radical resistance in its tracks. I look forward to seeing what happens because something is going on. You understand? Does that make sense, right? Something is going on, and they are not happy back there. The media is not happy. They are not happy. They never report this.
They don't report these crowds, they don't report this stuff. They never say -- they'll say, "Donald Trump, President Trump was in Ohio today. He made a speech in front a few thousand people." You know. Right? That's what they say. It's the most unbelievable thing. For years, you've watched as your leaders apologize for America.
Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values, we are standing up for the great state of Ohio, and we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. I am asking every citizen from every party and every background and every race, color and creed to reject the Democrat politics of anger and division and to unite behind our proud and righteous destiny as Americans.
It's our destiny. I need you to get your family, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and go out and vote Republican, vote for Jim Renacci, Jon Husted and Mike DeWine. Loyal citizens like you help build this country, and together, we are taking back our country, returning power to where it belongs, with you, the American people.
That's what this is all about. This great state was built by tough frontier men and strong pioneer women who braved the wilderness to build a life and a home with their own two hands. They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their country and they loved their God.
Religious liberty. These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, tear down our history and destroy our proud American heritage. From the farm fields of Ohio to the big sky of Montana, from the deserts of Nevada to the everglades of Florida, from the coal mines of West Virginia to the steel mills of Indiana and in every city and town all across our land, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win.
We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight onto victory. Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue! We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And Ohio, together we will make America wealthy again.
We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you.
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. And I see these signs all over place, Tigers for Trump. I like that. I like that. Hello, Missouri. I'm thrilled to be back in the American heartland, right here... with the incredible men and women that make this country run. You know it, too.
In just five days, the people of Missouri are going to retire far-left Democrat Claire McCaskill... who's been saying such nice things about me. But you know what? She'll never vote with me. That's the problem. She's been saying nice things. I said, I didn't know she was a Republican. She'll never vote.
She'll never vote. She never has, and she didn't even vote for Justice Kavanaugh. Think of that. Didn't vote. And you're going to send Missouri patriot -- and that's what he is. He loves your state. He loves you as people. He loves this country -- Josh Hawley to the United States Senate. He's a good man.
He'll be a star. Josh shares your values, and he will fight for your values all the time. So I need everyone to show up and vote. You've got to vote for Josh. And that's why I'm here, other than the fact I like you very much. And I'm actually coming back on Monday. Do you believe it? Coming back to Missouri on Monday.
We've got to make sure. He's a star in our country. He is going to be something special. He's going to represent you for a long time, and he's going to represent you well. This is one of the most important elections of our lifetime. This election will decide whether we build on an extraordinary prosperity that we have achieved, probably the greatest economy in the history of our nation.
Think about it. Or whether we let Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Claire McCaskill... and the radical Democrats wipe it all away. And they can do that. We've got to win. Under Republican leadership, America is booming. America is thriving. And America is winning because we are finally putting America first.
The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years. More Americans are working now than any time in history. Think of that. More Americans -- just think of that. So today, right now, we have more Americans working than at any time, any time in the history of our country. That's pretty good.
That's pretty good. That'll be a very good soundbite in the debate when we face one of those Democrats, whoever it may be. African American and Hispanic American poverty are at an all-time low. Our economy is at an all-time high. We've cut a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any administration in the history of our country, in less than two years, by the way, in less than two years.
So we've done in less than two years what any other president or administration did in four years, in eight years, or, in one case, in more than eight years. We've cut more. Pretty good. And we have more to cut. Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.
And remember the Democrats are going to substantially raise your taxes. Just what you need. We're putting our coal miners and steelworkers back to work. We're taking care of our veterans and our military... and we will soon have the most powerful military that we've ever had by far. The choice in this election could not be more clear.
The Republican agenda is the mainstream agenda of the American people. It's how we all got here, the greatest movement in the history of politics in our country. It's about you, not about me. The Democrat agenda is the agenda of the extreme far left. They've gone crazy, folks. They've gone totally loco. Republicans are the party of all Americans.
We welcome citizens from all walks of life and embrace freedom of thought, freedom of speech, and freedom of everything else. The Democrats are the party of rigid ideology and total conformity. They demand absolute agreement. And they dismiss, demean, and demonize anyone who questions their radical ideas.
Did you ever see anything like what's going on? You can't have dinner. You can't have dinner. Do you see what they're doing to our people? I mean, see what they're doing to people that represent our thought? And we're being so nice. We're being so nice. And let's stay being nice, right? We'll stay being nice.
Because we are tough as hell. We -- we're going to stay nice. [Audience chants USA] Don't forget: We've got the police. Law enforcement loves us. I don't know if they get anything out of -- I said to the police the other day, we're so high in the polls, we're trying to figure out who is representing the other side?
We don't even know. We want to figure it out. But we have the police. We have law enforcement. They're great people. We have bikers for Trump. Bikers for Trump. Is that 100 percent or, like, 95 percent? We have -- the military is for us. The vets are for us. The veterans are all for us. Veterans' choice.
We got 'em veterans' choice. No, we want to be nice. We're much tougher, we're much smarter, we're much more sane. We believe in the process. We don't run around like Antifa with their little arms and then go home back home into Mommy's basement... and put on the black uniform and the black helmet. Oh, it's so disappointing when those helmets fall off and you look at this weak little face, isn't it? And they hit people with clubs.
You know, they hit 'em again and again. Oh, they're so lucky we're nice, oh. Oh, they're so lucky! Then they go back home and they get yelled at by Mom and Dad. The Democrats lie. And you know what? I'm going to say, because this effort is the angry far-left media. The great Ed Rollins just said, I just heard it, that never before has a president had to withstand the level of partisan assault from the media that President Trump has had to withstand.
No, it's true. Because nobody ever had to take this. If we do great things, they come out bad. No matter what we do -- we could do the greatest in the world, should have gone faster. Well, they're doing that a little bit with -- not a little bit, how about a lot -- with North Korea. I took over North Korea.
You know, President Obama knows they were ready to go to war. And now we're getting along. No rockets, no nothing. They say, why can't he go faster? They've been doing this for 75 years. Why can't he go -- four months. It's been a long time. Been a long time. And today, I spoke to President Xi, great guy, great man from China.
And he is the boss. He's the head of China. And we spoke, and I said, look, we have to make a fair trade deal. He wants to do it. They all want to do it. We're going to the make -- lots of great things are going to happen over the next short period of time. But we had a great talk with President Xi on North Korea.
We had a great -- and the border is holding. And they've been honorable. And they're doing what they said they were going to do. And my relationship with Kim Jong-un is very good. And we are getting to a point where they really want to do something. And we're not going to have to worry about millions of lives being lost and nuclear weapons going up all over the place... and flying over Japan and everybody else.
No, it's been amazing. But no matter what you do, they actually got to a point -- because, you know, with North Korea, it is, we got our hostages back, right? We're getting the remains -- I don't know if you saw how beautiful that was. Mike Pence went to Hawaii. The remains of our great heroes from so many years ago are being sent back.
That never happened. Nobody expected that. That was so beautiful. And they're all coming -- they're coming back. They're coming back rapidly. No more missiles going up, no more nuclear tests for a long time. If you read the papers today, it came out to the surprise of a lot of people -- not a surprise to me -- that they don't mind having people come over, the experts, and check the sites.
We're doing well. And we kept the sanctions on. The sanctions are what we have, the sanctions are -- we haven't taken sanctions off. And, hopefully, we'll be able to when we're down the road. We want to take the sanctions off. We want North Korea to be very successful. But you know what? The new line, they met -- m-e-t -- they met.
We met. In other words, I actually met. And that's the thing we gave up. I said, I met. How am I going to do it if I don't meet? I met. So -- so their new line is he met. And because he met, it's a terrible thing for our country. Let me tell you, we would be in a nuclear war right now if the right person didn't come along.
So we're doing well. We're doing well. And again, with China, we're doing really well, too, on trade. They want to make a deal. We've got to make the right deal. Five hundred billion dollars a year for years have been coming out of this country, and lots of other things. And I said we have to make right deal.
We're going to make the right deal. It's going to work out good. But we had a great conversation today that you know about, nobody else knows -- now today that's going to be the news. Sorry about that, Josh. But he understands it. He gets it. We're doing great. As a country, we're doing great. We've never done better.
We are doing really well. And they're attacking me, really, because I'm fighting for you, and that's OK. That's a good reason because... because we really have to bypass the media, because it's so one-sided and unfair, in order to get straight to the American people. That's what we're doing. So that's what we're doing.
And it seems to work out pretty well, because here we are. Right? Here we are, folks. But someday we're going to get a good story from these people. Someday. And it's not all of them. Look, you have some of the fine people, some of, really, finest people I know. I know reporters, journalists, others, they're fine people.
But some are not honest. And we have to -- we have to just go around 'em. We just have to go around 'em, and we have gone around them like nobody in history has ever gone around them. Republicans believe in lower taxes, less regulation, and more American energy. We just became number one in the world in energy production.
Thank you. It's amazing what you can do with cutting regulations that are unnecessary. Amazing. And some regulations, by way, are very necessary. I want the cleanest water on the planet. We want the cleanest air on the planet. And we've got it. But we want to keep it just that way. We've got it. Better now than ever before.
Democrats want higher taxes, much higher taxes... They want many more regulations, and they want to shut down American energy. We're not shutting down American energy. It's an asset for us. Republicans want strong borders, no crime, no chaos, and no caravans. [Audience chants Build that wall] Thank you. Thank you.
And the wall is being built. We spent $1.6 billion... we spent another $1.6 billion this last year. We're getting another one -- we want to build it all at one time. We need it. They are doing everything in their power, the Democrats, to delay it and to stop it. And you need the wall. And now it's more obvious than ever.
We'll get it. We'll get it. We'll get it. I don't like doing it in bits and pieces, but that's what they're forcing us to do. And, you know, we called up the military, because we're not going to let people come into our country when you look at that illegally. Not going to happen. Our great military. And I don't know if you saw the one is coming up, that's a big caravan.
The only time I've seen them, they underestimate the crowd. They want to underestimate that crowd, which is easy for them, actually, to do. But that's a lot of people. Now if you see what's going on in El Salvador, and if you see what's going on in Honduras, and if you see what's going on in lots of places, they're starting little mini-caravans.
Not going to happen, folks. And the second -- I call it caravan number two. That one came out. Did you see these? Did you see how tough these young men, mostly young men, strong, tough, what they did to the police, the Mexican police, in breaking through the border? What they did -- what they did to the Mexican military in breaking through the border?
These are tough people. These are not angels. These are not little angels. These are tough people. And we're not letting them into our country. They're not coming in illegally. Right? And you take a look at the scene, where thousands and thousands of people are marching, and then you hear that Democrats want to have open borders, and they want to invite caravan after caravan into our country, overwhelming your schools, your hospitals, and your communities.
And by the way, those caravans, you know, you look at what's happening, does anybody think that's just by accident that they're forming? Does anybody think -- does anybody think? You know, I think what happened -- I really believe somebody was involved that's not on our side of the ledger. Somebody was involved.
And then somebody else told them, you made a big mistake. Look at what happened. You have made a big mistake, because people have really galvanized over this. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and through merit. And through merit. We need people. With a 3.7 percent unemployment, we have many, many companies moving back into our country.
I was with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. He gave me company after company -- automobile company -- moving to Michigan, moving to Ohio, moving to Pennsylvania. You don't really need 'em over here, you're doing so well. But you want one? I'll get you one, too. No, but they're moving. And I'm not just talking about automobile companies.
You look at -- look at how well your economy's doing now. Your economy was horrible a number of years ago. Look at your economy. Look what's happened. But we need people to come in to help run -- North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida. We need people to help run these massive car companies and other companies.
Look what we got, Foxconn, one of the great companies of the world, what they did in Wisconsin for Governor Walker. I mean, what he's done, what he did -- and I was very much involved with that one, and I want to give him full credit, because, I'll tell you what, I gave him that one, and he took it, and got it done.
It's one of the great companies of the world, and you have to see what they built. You have to see what they built in Wisconsin. Scott Walker. You have to see what they built. It's incredible, actually. It's as good as anything I've ever seen. But we need people. But we need people that can do the job. We need people -- it has to be based on merit.
No more lotteries. Oh, let's see, lottery, lottery, who are these people? You know, when countries do lotteries and they put people in a lottery, do you really believe they're giving us their finest? [Audience calls out No] And then we have problems, and we say we don't understand it. Republicans want judges who will interpret our Constitution as written.
They don't want to make 'em up. Democrats want judges who will rewrite the Constitution to impose their own radical views. And you see that happening at the border, and you see it happening all over. But we've appointed a lot of judges. We'll soon have a record in the number of federal district judges and judges that we've appointed.
And, of course, two Supreme Court judges. Two Supreme Court -- two great justices of the Supreme Court. A few weeks ago, we achieved that historic victory for our Constitution and for the rule of law. We defeated the Democrat mob and proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, who was treated very, very unfairly, by the way, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Justice Kavanaugh was treated as unfairly as any human being I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like it. But in the end, they all got smart, and we got him on. He was supposed to be a Supreme Court judge, like, 10 years ago, 12 years ago, long before I did this. I used to hear about a man named Brett Kavanaugh who someday will be on the Supreme Court, because of the intellect.
Great scholar. Great everything. And then he gets treated like the way he was treated? How unfair was that? But we got him in, and this will be the election of Kavanaugh, the caravans, law and order, tax cuts, and common sense. Common sense. A Republican Congress means more jobs and less crime. A Democrat Congress means more crime and less jobs.
And that sort of works. That's pretty good, isn't it? Wow. I'd almost like to repeat that. That's pretty good. This election is a choice between Republican results and radical resistance. It's a choice between greatness and gridlock. It's a choice between jobs and mobs. And it's a choice between an economy that is going strong and the Democrats who are going crazy.
So true. So this November 6th, vote against the Democrats and vote for commonsense Republicans. You're going to drain the swamp, you're going to replace the Democrats. It's happening. It's happening so fast. It's happening faster than anybody can believe. You know, it's all happening much faster than anybody could believe.
Even one of them recently said that President Trump made promises, but he's kept many more promises. I mean, far more than I made. Think of it. It's true. It's true. It's true. And we're not even that close to the second year, you know? We're not that close, right? We still have a couple of months to go. And we've done a lot.
We are honored tonight to be joined by a man that I've gotten to know very well, one of your Republican great people, and a great leader, Governor Mike Parsons. Mike? Where's Mike? Thanks, Mike. You're doing a great job. But I want to take full credit for what's happened in Missouri, Mike, is that OK? Great job, Mike.
Thank you. A friend of mine who's so outstanding, he's with us all the time, who works hard, loves the people of this state and loves this state, Senator Roy Blunt. Thanks, Roy. Great guy. And representatives, congressmen, women, great people that really work, and they always -- they always are with us. They never let us down.
Blaine Luetkemeyer... Vicky Hartzler... a man who did an auction recently. That was the coolest thing I've seen in a long time, you know? You get used to watching those hearings, and you're just falling asleep. And then you hear this sound, you say, what the hell is that? It was Billy Long. How good was he? And is he a great guy?
Congressman Billy Long. Great guy. Great friend of mine. And, of course, a man who, again, loves this state and loves the people and gets it done, never lets us down, Jason Smith. Jason? Thank you, Jason. Great group. Thank you also to former United States Attorney General John Ashcroft and his son, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, for being here.
Thank you both. Thank you, fellas. We're especially proud to be joined by a star. This is somebody that's going to win. He's going to go on to great, great things in our country. And he's been a winner from day one. We're very proud of him. He's doing well. He's up in the polls. But do yourself -- just pretend he's one point down, please, OK? Because he is outstanding.
We cannot take a chance on something going awry on Tuesday. That's why I'm coming again on Monday. We can't take that chance. You people in Missouri, you're going to say, I can't believe it, the president's here again! But I'm here, because I believe in Josh Hawley. And come on up, Josh. Come on.
Isn't it an incredible honor to have President Donald Trump in Missouri? It's amazing. It's amazing. You know, you know, President Trump won in the state of Missouri in 2016 by 20 points. Twenty points! More than anybody. And President Trump is delivering for Missouri. He's delivering. Now, the only thing is, I noticed that some of those career politicians in Washington, D.C., haven't noticed and haven't gotten with the program.
Like, for instance, Senator Claire McCaskill. It's sad. You know, President Trump, President Trump is putting pro-Constitution, pro-America judges on the bench, but Claire McCaskill voted no. President Trump is securing our border, but Claire McCaskill, she voted no. She voted no. You know, Senator McCaskill voted for amnesty.
She voted against the wall. Now she's sponsoring an open borders bill in the United States Congress. Is that what we want? President Trump -- President Trump lowered your taxes. But Claire McCaskill voted no! You know, I guess the only thing I can think of that can explain it is Claire McCaskill did say that she thinks that the reason President Trump got elected was because of the Russians.
Yeah, I'm serious. Yeah. Right. What she doesn't realize is, he's president of the United States because of the Missourians, because of us! When I look at Senator McCaskill's record, I have to say, Mr. President, it really reminds me of another career politician that you recently defeated. It reminds me of the person that Claire thinks should be president, Hillary Clinton.
I mean, get this. Get this... [Audience chants Lock her up] You know, Claire McCaskill -- Claire McCaskill has spent her lifetime in politics, just like Hillary. Claire McCaskill has made a boatload of money on federal taxpayers, just like Hillary. Claire McCaskill even has a phony foundation that rakes in millions of dollars a year, pays no taxes, just like Hillary.
You know, Claire McCaskill -- Claire McCaskill wanted us to call Hillary Clinton Madam President. Well -- well, on November the 6th, because of the leadership of Donald Trump, on November the 6th, we're going to call Claire McCaskill fired. Let's go get it done! [Audience chants USA]
So Josh Hawley will be one of the greatest champions for Missouri that you've ever had, and you've had some good ones, by the way.
You've had some good ones, haven't you? Josh is running against far-left Democrat and card-carrying member of the Washington, D.C., group that we all know so much about, Claire McCaskill, who, by the way, I've seen commercials, I've seen her statements. She now all of a sudden loves border security. Where did that come from?
Did you -- today! I was watching her interview, and every time -- every third sentence, like, we love Trump. We love border security. The president's right about border security. I said, what happened to her? Look, the fact is, she wants to get elected, and then she's always going to vote against us, folks.
OK? A vote for Claire is a vote to make Chuck Schumer majority leader and to enact the extreme agenda of Nancy Pelosi and, of course, the legendary Maxine Waters. Claire McCaskill promised to represent the people of Missouri, but she broke that promise and joined radical Democrats in Washington. She's not representing Missouri.
And Josh said it, I won by 20 points. I know the people. I know the people. Your senator, Senator Blunt, knows me very well. He will tell you. I know the area well. We campaigned, we worked together, and we know the people. That's not what you want. You don't want Claire McCaskill. She voted against the massive tax cuts that you got.
And by the way, she will end up trying -- with them, they've got a long way to go -- trying to increase your taxes very substantially. She voted against Neil Gorsuch. And she joined the Democrat mob and voted against our great Justice Brett Kavanaugh. She's got one of the most open borders, until today, voting records in Congress.
Today she changed. I must take that back. Did she change? Maybe. Josh, did she change? She's totally for open borders, but today she thinks I'm right. I don't know. But you know what? On November 7th, she'll say I was wrong. Claire McCaskill voted no on Kate's law. She voted no on enhanced vetting for refugees.
Just let 'em come in, folks. Let 'em come in. Did you see the guy today, they interviewed him? I put it on social media, because I'm being nice. And they said, well, what do you want? Well, I want a pardon, I want a pardon. A woman, like -- she's like this reporter, I guess. And innocent, nice. Oh, you want a pardon?
What did you to? What did you do? What did you do? Murder. Murder! Homicide, something. What did you do? Murder. And she -- this is one of the people in the caravan, by way. What did you do? Murder. You want murder? You want a pardon? This is -- can you believe what's going on in this country? But we're getting a change.
This big ship is turning a lot faster than anyone thought possible. And remember that Claire McCaskill voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities. We don't want sanctuary cities. So don't listen to what Claire says. Just look at how she votes. All you have to do is take a look. She votes with the crazy Democrats, and they have gone crazy.
A vote for Claire is a vote for more taxes, more crime, and more illegal immigration. Very simple. And just to finish up, you vote for Josh, you're going to reduce your taxes, you're going to substantially reduce crime. We're doing great, anyway, considering we have the worst immigration laws in the history of the world, the dumbest laws, laws that make no sense on illegal immigration.
But we're doing well anyway. We're taking thousands and thousands of MS-13 gang members, and we're throwing 'em the hell out of the country back where they came from. And you know who's doing that? Law enforcement and ICE. They want to get rid of ICE. And nobody in this room -- I see a couple of guys that wouldn't mind, I see a couple of people.
I see one woman there that wouldn't mind, too. But nobody here wants to do that. And they do it. It's like a day in the office. They're tough, and they're smart. And that's what you have to be. You have to be tough. These people, they call them nests. You go into a nest. They are bad. Everyone needs to show up and vote for Josh Hawley.
Please do it. Please do it. A majority of the Democrats on the ballot for Congress have already signed up to support a total socialist takeover of health care that would totally destroy Medicare. So true. The Democrat plan would eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than 400,000 Missouri seniors who depend on it. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it. And guess what?
They've paid for it. They've been paying for it for a long time. And Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. The Democrat plan also raids Medicare to fund benefits for illegal aliens. That's great. Democrats are the party of open borders, socialism, and crime, whether you like it or not.
As we speak, the Democrat Party is openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and bankrupt our country, and they want to sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and, of course, the right to vote. Great. And the Democrats want to continue giving automatic birthright citizenship to every child born to an illegal alien.
Even if they've been on our soil for a mere matter of seconds. Hundreds of thousands of children born to illegal immigrants are made automatic citizens of the United States every year because of this crazy, lunatic policy that we can end. That we can end. We need support, but we can do it. And they're all made instantly eligible for every privilege and benefit of American citizenship.
All of you? You get nothing more than they do. They're full citizens. And it's costing us many, many billions of dollars a year. You don't realize what a big industry -- it's an industry. And many come from China. You'll be surprised. China now is number one. We're not talking just South America, Latin America.
We're talking about China, parts of Asia. It's crazy. Think of it. You're an enemy of our country. You're a general with war on your mind. You're a dictator who we hate and who's against us. And that dictator has his wife have a baby on American soil. Congratulations. Your son or daughter is now an American citizen.
Does anybody think this makes sense? Does anybody think it makes sense? Congratulations, General, you have a United States citizen as your daughter. It's crazy. It's crazy. But we're getting it all worked out. This policy has even created an entire industry. It's called, you know, birth tourism, where pregnant mothers from all over the world travel to America to make their children instant lifelong citizens with guaranteed everything.
Everything. Everything that you have is guaranteed. Welfare, public benefits, right? Birthright citizens in turn can then bring their entire extended family into our country through chain migration. That's another beauty. Chain migration. You come into the country, you're like two months old, and you're going to take your brother and your sister and your mother and your father.
You're going to bring 'em all, aunts and uncles and grandfathers, and lots of people. I tell the story, we have -- a horrible incident took place on West Side Highway a year ago, where a maniac decided to kill people, so he's driving his car at a very, very high rate of speed along a park right along the beautiful Hudson River.
And there's a group of people working out and running and all sorts of things, recreation, most beautiful park along the river. And he decides to hang a right and run over many people. Eight people died. They never mention all the people that have been so horrifically injured, where they lose arms and legs and everything else.
They never mention. They say eight people died. What they don't tell you is that many arms lost, many legs lost. So they got him, this maniac. He'll be in court for the next 20 years, you know, fighting, claiming something with some good lawyer. But we'll get him eventually. And what happens? He is a man that through chain migration brought in his mother, his father, his uncles, his brothers, his sisters.
They think it's probably 22 people came on and into this country because of this guy who killed eight people and so gravely wounded and injured so many more. It's a disgrace. And we've got to change our laws. And the Democrats refuse to do it. And it's not because they don't know right from wrong. They think it's good politically for them to make us all go through hell to get those laws changed.
We're going to get 'em changed, OK? Democrats want to spend your money and give away your resources to the benefit of everyone but the American citizens. We're changing that rapidly, if you've noticed. If you want a government that cares about you, vote Republican. If you want your children to have a country, vote Republican.
You won't have a country. If you don't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you'd better vote Republican. If you want to keep drugs, gangs, crimes, if you want to keep human traffickers -- think of that. In the history of our -- human traffickers, they steal, they kidnap women.
Many, many, many women. But they kidnap people. And it's a big business because of the internet. It's worse today worldwide, worse today than ever before. Think of it. The human traffickers. Who would even think this goes on? These are horrible, horrible people. And we are working on that so hard. It's because of the internet.
The internet gives them this tremendous advantage. They use the internet for horrible, horrible means, including ISIS, which as you know we've done a very serious number with... But we're going to keep these people out of our country. Vote Republican. And I told you, we're finishing the wall, we're working on the wall, we're taking down MS-13. We're supporting the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement.
You are going to get Josh Hawley. We're going to finish it up. We're so far ahead of schedule, it's incredible. This election is about safety, and it's also about your prosperity. We're going to keep it going. In less than two years' time, we have created over -- think of this -- we've created, in less than -- nobody would believe it. The wonderful media back there -- I'm trying to be nice -- the wonderful media, if I would have said during the campaign that we're going to create 4.2 million new jobs since the election and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps, they'd say, how can he dare say a thing like that?
Well, that's what we did. Far, far, far greater than anyone thought. We've created almost 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. You remember the previous administration? We can't create manufacturing jobs anymore. They're the best jobs. They're the most important jobs. They're great jobs. And they're high-paying jobs.
And we do it better than anybody, 600,000. And it's going up rapidly as these companies come back into the United States. They all want to be in the United States, because now, for the first time in decades, we are where it's at. We're the hot country. Can you believe it? [Audience chants USA] We're the hot country.
And you know what? As a country, we are respected again. We're respected again. We're respected again. You didn't think you'd hear that, right? You never thought you'd hear that, right? They respect us. China respects us. And everybody, Russia respects us. They all respect the United States. They all respect what we've done.
You know, I meet a lot of leaders. They're great, you know, some of them. Some I like, some I don't like. What the hell. But every one of them, they come in, they say, Mr. President, congratulations on what you've done for this country, what you've done with the economy is incredible. We have the hottest economy in the world.
Think of it. And they all come in, congratulations, congratulations. African American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever in recorded history. African American youth unemployment is at an all-time historic low. The Democrats have undermined jobs and wages in the African American community for years, for decades, for a century.
Republicans are fighting and delivering every day for the African American community, and they know it. They see it. The support is incredible. Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached all-time historic lows. Thanks to our pledge to America's workers, in just three months, we have secured commitments from over 160 of the biggest companies in our country to train and recruit more than 6 million workers, 5 percent of our force.
Women's unemployment just fell to 3.6 percent, which is, as you know, you've heard me say -- I'm trying to get that historic number. It's only 65 years, women. You know, they keep saying I'm not doing well with women. They said that before the last election. They said it -- they said it before the last election.
And then when the election was over, they said, you know, it's an amazing thing. He did great with women. What the hell. We're doing great. You know why? Women are smart. Women are smart. They're smarter than the men, but don't say I said it. Women are smart, and they want security. They have to have security.
They need borders. They want borders. They don't want people pouring into the country that you don't know where they come from, who they are, what their record is. There's nothing -- women want security. They want jobs, and they want homes, and they want -- but they have to have security. And women want security.
And that's why we're doing great with women, and we always have done well with women. Last month, I announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal, one of the worst trade deals ever made, probably the worst, with an incredible, brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement, the USMCA, right? Remember they said, oh, he's never going to be able to get it done.
And we got it -- and not only did we get it done, you're very happy with it, everybody's happy. We're happy. We're happy with it. The USMCA is a massive victory for Missouri farmers, manufacturers and dairy producers. We opened up Canada. It was closed. We opened up Canada. They're gladly taking our stuff.
Thanks to our tariffs, steel mills all across the nation are roaring back to the life. I taxed all of the dumped garbage steel. They were dumping garbage on our shores. I taxed them 25 percent. What you never hear is that billions of dollars will be flowing into our coffers. Billions. They're paying billions of dollars.
And our steel industry, as you know very well, is one of the hottest industries right now in the country. It's incredible what's happened in, literally, six months since I started really going to town on it. And aluminum. And aluminum. And by the way, we need a steel industry. We were going to have no steel industry within a couple of years.
U.S. Steel is now building seven plants. They're renovating plants. Nucor is building these massive new plants. They're going to town. And wait until you see what's going to happen ultimately. We're getting the iron ore from Minnesota, the finest quality stuff, we're getting it from here, we're getting it from all over.
Our mines are opening up. Our miners are working again, not just with coal. It's an incredible thing to see. But we need a steel industry. You know, some industries we can do without. I won't mention, because probably some of you are in those industries. But we need steel for defense. What happens if we don't have steel?
We were not going to have steel in a couple of years. It was going to -- it was a dead business. What happens if we don't have steel and we need it for military conflict? And hope that will never happen. We going to call up China and say, listen, we need some steel? Help, help, we need steel! We don't want to ask anybody for help.
So our steel industry is now thriving and getting better every single day. And it's jobs, and it's that money pouring into our coffers. It's beautiful. We've also taken the toughest-ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices. They understand it. And I think we're going to work a deal, you know, very good.
I think it's going to be very good. And if it's not, I'll let you know. It's got to be unbelievably good, because if it's not, they're going to say it's a terrible deal. And if it's unbelievably good, they'll say it's OK. If you read that the deal is OK, you know I really struck gold for this country. It's OK. He got the deal done, it's OK, you know?
We'll make billions and billions, and they'll say, OK, it's all right. Not bad. It's going to have to be really good for that. After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding, folks, our country. Every day, it's promises made, promises kept. We've taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs.
We're reducing the price. The drug companies aren't liking me too much now, but that's OK. That's OK. I've had people say that's more important than almost anything. I have people that say -- because we've done great on health care, but I've had people say that reducing the cost of prescription drugs is maybe in a certain way more important than health care.
And you watch what's going to happen. Just watch prescription drug prices. You know, I called up Pfizer and some of the great drug companies. They're great companies. Novartis, a couple of others, about a month ago, because they raised the price of their drugs. And I called, I said, what are you doing? You can't do that.
I'm cutting prices. Look, it's all profit. So much profit. They make so much profit. But they just raised it. You know, why not? They've been raising it for years. They got away with it with the politicians that didn't know what the hell they were doing. So they were raising the price of drugs, and they were going to raise them substantially, and they announced the raise.
One after the other, I called my people, Secretary Alex Azar, fantastic. I said, I've got to call these people. I called the head of Pfizer. I called some of the others. And that's when I realized this is a very powerful office. They had raised them. They had announced the raise of price. And they said, sir, we will immediately drop the price down to where it was.
Can you believe that? Can you believe that? It didn't get much news, folks, but you know it. You know it. At least I can tell you. Might as well talk about yourself, because nobody else is going to. Nobody else is going to! Nobody else. So these drug companies -- and I do appreciate Pfizer and Novartis and so many others, they really did, they dropped it down.
Now they're going to drop it down because we're getting rid of a lot of the middleman, it's called. I never heard middleman and middlewoman. You probably have some women in there, too, so we'll call them the middleman and the middlewoman. But this tremendous gap of wasted money. And we're knocking it down, and we are -- you're going to see some great results very soon.
To help critically ill patients get life-saving treatment, we passed something that they've been trying to pass for 46 years. It's called right to try. You all know what it is. Hopefully, nobody has to use it. I don't want you to use it. I hope you don't have to use it, but we have the finest doctors and research and medicines in the world.
And it's in the pipeline, and it takes a while, although we've cut the time way, way down. It was almost 15 years to get something approved. We're cutting it down. We're trying to get it scot. We're trying to get it down to three or four years. We have to be careful. But if we had something that really looked promising and somebody was terminally ill, they could not use that drug, and you'd see them -- if they had money.
If they didn't, they'd go home and there was nothing they could do. They're looking for hope. And what happened is they'd go all over the world, they'd go to Asia, they'd go to Europe, all over the world looking for a secret cure. And we have the best chance right here. So now you go in, you sign a piece of paper, which is just fine, and you get taken care of, and we have had some incredible results already.
It's amazing. It's really amazing. It's amazing. It's also a great way to see if it works, to be honest with you. I mean, it's a great way. But it gives these people hope. It gives them hope. And they don't have to go all over the world to much lesser talents and look for something. We have had already -- this was three months ago -- already some amazing stories.
We passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor. Forty-four years, and I thought it was my idea. And I said, I have the greatest idea. I went to my people. I have the greatest idea. What you'll do is instead of having them wait seven days, 23 days, 38 days, three months, we have had patients and people that were not very sick, and by the time they saw the doctor, they were literally terminally ill.
Now you go out and you see a private doctor, and we pay the bill. And Senator Blunt helped a lot on that, Senator Blunt. But I thought that was my idea. I'll tell you, I walked off -- I said, man, am I smart? I'm so smart. Then I went to my people, I said, I have an idea. We're going to take the person off the line, let them go see a local doctor maybe a block away, we pay the bill.
They said, yes, sir, we've been working on this for 44 years. But I got it done. So, you know, at least I got it approved, right? At least I got it approved. And we passed the V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable and we'll just look at them and we'll say, get out of here, you're fired.
Right? We secured $700 billion and the second year $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military. And I know it doesn't mean anything to the warriors that are with us tonight in the military, I know they couldn't care less about this, but we gave them their largest pay raise in more than 10 years.
They don't care. They don't care about that. And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces. It's called the Space Force. We're keeping America safe from radical Islamic terrorism. Being very careful. And we are keeping open the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.
I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. What a difference that made. Iran is not the same country it was when I came into office, I will tell you. They were looking to take over Syria and Yemen and every place, Iraq. Right now, they want to survive. They were looking to the Mediterranean, which is very far away.
They wanted to see the Mediterranean. Right now, they have to survive. It's not the same country. Not the same country. Hopefully they're going to get smart. Hopefully they're going to get smart. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Together we've made extraordinary progress, and we are just getting started.
But if Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Claire McCaskill, and the crazy Democrats -- and one thing I will say, even Claire McCaskill today said they are crazy Democrats, which is pretty good -- if they get back into power, they will try everything they can to raise the hell out of your taxes and restore those regulations that have meant so much, impose socialism, destroy your Medicare, and eliminate your borders.
If you vote Republican this November, we will continue to cut your taxes, more so. We're working on bills right now. It's more money going into our system, believe it or not. Cut your regulations and raise your incomes. We will protect Medicare. And remember during the debates, during the debates, I was the only one -- I said, we will protect your Social Security.
Nothing's happened with your Social Security. We will continue to confirm judges who will support and defend the Constitution of the United States. We will fully secure the border. We will pass Kate's law. We will stop sanctuary cities. We will do all of it. And, folks, I'll tell you what, we have a tremendous opportunity to do something tremendous, just so great for our country.
This is a very important election. These are the midterms. Nobody thought of the midterms as being that big a deal for years. For years. Nobody thought of the midterms. You know, you hear midterms, it's like let's go to sleep, right? This year, we're breaking every single record in attendance for the midterms.
They're getting more people than some of the presidential elections. More people. And in one way, it's a beautiful thing. And I will tell you, we have gotten tremendous numbers, tremendous numbers of Republicans are going out to vote. Now, we did have two maniacs stop our momentum that was incredible, because for seven days, nobody talked about the election to stop the tremendous momentum.
More importantly, we have to take care of our people. And we don't care about momentum when it comes to a disgrace like just happened to our country. But it did nevertheless stop a certain momentum. And now the momentum is picking up. And it's picked up based on common sense. It's picked up based on strong borders.
It's picked up based on taxes. It's picked up based on everything you can think of that makes sense. Just add it in. We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. For years you watched as your leaders apologize for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America.
Proudly. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Missouri. And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. Along with the Tigers. Right? [Audience chants USA] For every voter across this land, whether you are registered as a Democrat or Republican or an independent, we are asking for your support so that we can protect your family, your prosperity, and we can protect your great country.
To continue our incredible momentum, you must reject the Democrat politics of anger and hatred and division and fear. And you see it. You must stay no to open borders, no to socialism, and no to higher job-killing taxes. You must say no to Democrats. And you must say yes to Republicans. You must vote for Josh Hawley.
Get out there. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people. This is where we all started. It was right here in Missouri that the great explorers, Lewis and Clark -- that's very impressive -- that's very impressive, Lewis and Clark -- that's big time -- began their epic journey across the American West.
Their voyage of discovery led generations of tough frontier men and strong, brilliant pioneer women to defy the dangers and brave the wilderness to build a life and to build a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God.
True. It's true. These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud American heritage. We didn't do that. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win.
We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender, ever, ever, ever. We will always go on. We will fight only to victory. We are one people and one family and one glorious American destiny. We all share the same home. We all share the same heart.
We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same almighty God. And to the people of Missouri, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Missouri. Thank you. Thank you.
Hello, Iowa. It is great to be back in beautiful Council Bluffs with thousands of hard-working, great, great American patriots. Thank you.  This is truly a historic week for America.  And you know what I'm talking about. Of course, yesterday at the White House, we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
And today, Justice Kavanaugh took his seat alongside of Justice Gorsuch to defend your rights, your Constitution, and your God-given freedom.  And I want to thank our incredible Republican senators for refusing to back down in the face of the Democrats' shameful campaign of political and personal destruction.
I especially want to thank an Iowa legend, whose backbone and leadership made this great victory possible, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a very tough cookie, Chuck Grassley. Thank you, Chuck.  Thank you. Great man. Great person. From the very first minute Brett Kavanaugh was nominated, radical Democrats were on a mission to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy -- they wanted to destroy that man, because they want to destroy me, too, but that's OK.  Me, we understand.
Him, how can you do that? They want to destroy everything. That's all they're good at, resisting. Their whole campaign is to resist. Ours is to create.  What the Democrats did to Brett and his beautiful family is a national embarrassment, a national disgrace. You see what's happening and you see where they're coming from.
You see. Including the phony protestors that got paid...  ... and now they want to protest because they didn't get paid yet, and they want their money.  So now they're going to really protest.  You see, that's a real protest. But in just four weeks, you will have the chance to render your verdict on the Democrats' outrageous conduct.
On November 6th -- and you can do early voting in Iowa. Go. Just vote. Get it over with.  Vote. Go vote. Early voting started today. Right? Today. Early vote. Go do it immediately. Then you don't have to listen to me any more tonight.  In fact, if you did early voting already, go home. Have a good time. Thank you.
We'll let some additional people from outside in, right? Nah, that's not going to happen. Got a lot of people outside. Look at this place. You believe it?  It never changes. Could I ask the cameras to just take a swoop of this room, please? Do you mind? Come on.  They don't like to do that. They don't like to -- they like to keep that camera dead set on me and about six people in the background.
All wearing hats saying "Make Farmers Great Again."  And we're doing it. I shouldn't -- we're a little bit early. I shouldn't say it now, but we're going with E15 year round, OK?  I made that promise to you during the campaign. I made that promise to you during the primaries. Remember? I made that promise.
Promises made, promises kept.  Right? On November 6th, you have the chance to stop the radical Democrats by electing a Republican House and a Republican Senate. So, we need the votes.  We have a majority that if one person has a cold, we have to hold the vote. I mean, can you -- we don't have -- it's like we hardly have a majority.
We need votes.  Early voting is now underway. And you know that. You got to get out. Early voting, go out now and vote. Leave here now immediately. Is it still open? Yes, get the hell out of here. Early voting.  And in their lust for power, the Democrats have become totally unhinged. They've gone -- they've gone crazy.
No, they've gone crazy. Now the Democrats -- or as some people would says, the Dims -- the Dims -- who says that? Lou Dobbs, the great Lou Dobbs. He says that, right? Sean Hannity says that. The Dims. Sean Hannity.  Judge Jeanine says that, doesn't she?  Laura -- Laura, how good has Laura been, right?  We got a lot of good people.
Do we like -- do we like Tucker? I like Tucker.  He says that a lot. How about Steve Doocy? How about Ainsley, Brian? We got a lot of great friends.  The Democrats are even talking about doing really bad things now to Justice Kavanaugh. You know what they're talking about? And packing the courts with radical judges to overrule the will of the American people.
It's not going to happen, folks. Not going to happen.  Last week, they're saying we'll impeach him. Impeach him for what? For what?  Besides that, I have to go first, right? Don't I have to go...  Even though we've done nothing wrong, other than create one of the greatest economies in the history of our country...  That will be interesting.
You get impeached for having created the greatest economy in the history of our country. The best job numbers in the history of our country, just about, right? The greatest trade deals, which we've just finished, in the history of our country.  The biggest regulatory cuts by far already in less than two years, bigger than any other president during their entire term or terms...  The biggest tax cuts and reforms -- you got a lot of money back -- in the history of our country.
But the Democrats have become too extreme. And they've become, frankly, too dangerous to govern. They've gone wacko.  They've gone so far left that they consider Pocahontas to be a rational person. No, it's crazy. Elizabeth Warren.  Oh, I hope she runs. I hope she runs. Then we can finally get down to the fact as to whether or not she has Indian blood.
So far, she's not doing too well. Her mother says she has high cheekbones. That's why.  And she's gotten a lot of advantages by falsely claiming what she's claiming. So I hope she's one of the finalists. But I don't want to knock too many of them, because maybe by doing I'll knock them all out early and I'll actually end up somebody that's -- like, that's got some talent.
That wouldn't be good. So we have to be nice and quiet.  I should be really quiet, really, really, quite on the bad ones. On the bad ones.  Like, we won't talk about Cory Booker, who ran Newark into the ground.  We won't talk about Da Nang Dick...  ... who tried to convince people for 15 years that he was a great war hero.
They were going down left. They were going down right.  Right, you know who that is? Blumenthal. He said they were going on my left, they were going down -- he was in Da Nang Province. Except the one problem. It's hard to be there, because he was never in Vietnam, but these are minor details.  And then he gets up. He goes, I demand total honesty and transparency.
I'm saying, what's -- he wants honesty. Great war hero. He's a great hero.  Yeah. Right, how about -- how about Senator Feinstein? That's another beauty.  That's a beauty. Did you leak the documents? Well, what, what? No, I didn't do it. Did we leak? Did we leak?  No. No. No, we didn't -- did you ever see -- no, she goes no. He just said, no, we didn't leak.
[Audience chants Lock her up]  And I think they're talking about Feinstein. Can you believe that? Now, was that the worst body language, honestly? In other words, did she leak it? A hundred percent.  No, no, I don't want to get sued. Ninety-nine percent. See, now I can't get sued. Now I can't get sued.  You don't hand matches to an arsonist, and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob.
And that's what the Democrats are becoming.  They would turn our country so fast into Venezuelan -- and Venezuelan is not doing too well, folks. If you want to drain the swamp, you must defeat the Democrats, so you're going to have one hell of a swamp.  Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving.
And America is winning again like never before, because we are finally putting America first.  The national unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7 percent. You believe that one?  3.7 percent, the lowest in 50 years, five-oh, 50. And it's going better. It's going better. Iowa's unemployment rate is 2.5 percent, among the lowest in its history that we can find.
And by the way, we need people helping you. We need people coming in. We need people to run the farms. We're going to have people coming in. But they're going to come in legally, and they're going to come in through merit, through merit. It's called the merit system. [Audience chants Build the wall]  And we've built the wall -- we're building the wall.
We've started. A lot of it's getting done right now. We got $1.6 billion. Another $1.6 billion. And another $1.6 billion. I want 'em to give us the money so I can build it -- we can build it in a year. But we've done a lot of it. It's going up right now.  But, you know, the Democrats feel that that's one thing we really want, we got our money for the military, $700 billion.
We got our money to help us out with the opioid crisis, $6 billion.  But when it comes to the wall, they feel we want it so badly, but we keep getting big chunks and we keep building that wall. And it's under construction. And we're going to get it finished sooner than anyone would believe. And if you could get me some Republicans, we'll get it done quickly.
Quickly.  I mean, when I have to ask Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters...  ... Maxine Waters, can we build a wall, Maxine? No, I don't want that wall built. She doesn't want a wall built. Can we build it? How about -- how about Pelosi? We want to build a wall. No, I don't want that wall built.  Look, Iowa manufacturing jobs are growing at the fastest rate in more than 20 years.
And if you remember...  ... the last administration, without mentioning names, the last administration said manufacturing jobs, they're dead. They're gone. We have 600,000 have come back since the election.  Six hundred thousand. More Americans are now working than ever before. Think of that. At this point today, this day, we have more Americans by far working -- right now working than have ever worked in our country before.
Isn't that great? That's a big number. That's a big number.  Today I kept another major promise, as I said, to the people of Iowa and Nebraska and other countries.  Wait. Hey, wait a minute. I got to do that again. I got to do that again. I love Nebraska. You know we won Iowa, we won Nebraska...  But they said, sir, you're speaking in Iowa, but we'll have some people from Nebraska there.
What the...  Like I said, Nebraska...  OK, so -- and we have both. By the way, we have both great governors here.  And I did that just in case. So, ready? I'm going to go Iowa first, then I'm going to go Nebraska. I just want to see who the hell I'm speaking to.  OK? Because that was a little shocking what I just heard.
So I'm going to go -- I'm just curious, OK? Iowa.  Nebraska.  Unbelievable. So they said, sir, you're speaking in Iowa, there may be a few people coming in from Nebraska. I don't think that's right. Great going, fellas. Great going. I'll tell my staff, great going, fellas.  Doesn't matter. We love both. Who cares, right?
Who cares? We love 'em.  All I know is you've got a lot of farmers in both, right?  And my administration is protecting ethanol, all right? That's what you want to hear.  Today, we are unleashing the power of E15 to fuel our country all year long. Not eight months. All year long.  The Dems will end ethanol.
You know that. They're not going to approve ethanol. They will take it away as -- we'll try and make it, like, so they can't do it to -- but they will find a way to take it away if you give them rights. You better get out there and vote for Republicans.  We've also achieved another historic victory for Iowa farmers and ranchers, by replacing the job-killing NAFTA with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA.
But if Democrats take control, they will try to reverse our amazing progress and plunge our country into gridlock, frankly, into poverty, ultimately into chaos. That's what's going to happen.  And we've never had it like it's been now. We've never had it like it is now. Look at all the money you people are making.
What are you going to do with it?  Democrats want to raise your taxes, impose socialism, dismantle law enforcement...  ... eliminate ICE...  ... and get rid of American borders. You want to get rid of the borders, right? You won't have a country.  And I've been saying this, and I mean it. Democrats are the party of crime.
They are. Republicans are the party of safety. We are also the party of jobs, jobs, jobs.  Now, we're thrilled to be joined tonight by a number of terrific Republican leaders. Iowa Congressman Steve King...  Where's Steve? Where is he? Where is Steve? Where is he? I wish he could get a little bit more conservative.
Can you believe this guy? He may be -- we're all -- he may be the world's most conservative human being.  Thank you, Steve.  And I supported him long before I became a politician. Do I have to use that term? Am I a politician?  Thank you, Steve. And another great, great gentleman, so much help to me, Congressman Jeff Fortenberry.
Thanks, Jeff. Great job. Thank you. They're always with us. They are -- those two, always with us.  Another friend of mine, got to know him during the primaries, got to know him during the election. We took this state by storm. He helped. But I did even better than him. You know, you still need a -- you still need a product, right?
But we did great. And we love the people of Iowa. We took Nebraska equally.  By a lot. By a lot. That wasn't close. Iowa GOP Chair -- friend of mine -- Jeff Kaufmann. Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. Great job, Jeff. Get ready, Jeff. We're coming back soon, Jeff. And from Nebraska...  ... where's Tom Osborne, huh?
Where is he? Where's Tom Osborne?  And I don't know Tom Osborne. All I know -- it's "Tom Osborne," right? All I know is for years all he knew how to do is win, win, just win.  I mean, how good a coach was that guy? You know, there's a guy -- again, I don't know him, never met him. But it's called no talk, all action.
Isn't that nice?  Now, what you did every year, you won. Better get going, Nebraska.  But we have a governor who's done a fantastic job. He's so into so many different things, including cutting your taxes, and we have him with us, Governor Pete Ricketts. Pete?  Great guy. Great. I think they like you, Pete.
Vote for Ricketts. That's November. Right? Vote for Ricketts. He's got an opponent that doesn't have what you need, but still you never know. You got to get out there and vote, right, Pete? You have a vote. Great job, Pete.  And Congressman Don Bacon...  Incredible guy. Great job, Don. He's always there.
He's always there, Don Bacon. He's always there. Thank you, Don. Great job. Appreciate it. Every time we needed him, he's there. Thank you.  And Nebraska GOP Chair Dan Welch. Thank you, Dan. Thanks, Dan. What a great group. And I am especially thrilled to introduce a person just to come up for a second to say a couple of words, because she has become a real star in the Republican Party and in politics.
Kim Reynolds, she fights every day for the people of Iowa. And she always delivers and -- wow, does she have my endorsement. She's incredible. Kim, please come up. Kim Reynolds.  Kim Reynolds.
Thank you so much. Oh, my gosh! This is amazing! Thank you all for being here! This is incredible! Welcome back, Mr. President, to the great state of Iowa. And on behalf of all Iowans, I want to say thank you, thank you for cutting taxes for hard-working Iowans, for eliminating senseless regulations that stifled innovation and jobs, for standing strong with Justice Kavanaugh and appointing conservative judges to the court!
Thank you. Thank you for USMCA and for KORUS. And, Mr. President, thank you for year-round E15! Our farmers thank you. Iowans thank you. And we are grateful. Promises made, promises kept. The Midwest has a partner in the White House with President Donald Trump. Woo! It is an incredible honor to serve as the 43rd governor of this great state.
And my story is the Iowa story. It's a reflection of the opportunities that exist here, where a small-town girl, daughter of a factory worker and farmer, who waited tables, checked groceries, never gave up on her dream of getting a college degree, is standing before you today as the first female governor of the state of Iowa.
I understand the challenges that everyday Iowans have faced because I've faced them myself. And that's why I'm proud that we focused on cutting taxes, expanding and growing jobs and wages and opportunities, addressing Iowa's health care needs and creating strong and safe communities. Iowa is working. The Midwest is working.
And we're getting things done. We're recognized as the number-one state in the country, second lowest unemployment, third best managed, wages are going up, taxes are going down. Our budget is balanced. And we're going to keep Iowa moving. We need your help. We need -- Republicans need your help. We need your support.
And to do that, we have to show up. We have to go vote. And if you do that, I promise you, Republicans up and down this ticket are going to be a partner for our great president, to keep the Midwest and moving forward and to keep the United States of America number one! God bless you! God bless the great state of Iowa and the United States of America!
Wow. Good energy. That's what you need, good energy. Thank you, Kim. Great. By the way, Kim's opponent this November is a radical Dem named Fred Hubbell. He's got some problems. He's weak on crime, weak on borders, doesn't want any. Only wants to massively raise your taxes. He wants to take away your ethanol.
What I'm giving you, he will take, very quickly. Wants to devastate your farms and businesses with an avalanche of job-killing regulations that we just got rid of. Everybody get out and vote for Governor Reynolds on Election Day. Finally, I want to introduce another great Iowa Republican, Congressman David Young.
When you said, David -- he's a great guy -- he's another one, fellas, he's with us, he's with us all the way -- when you said, David, to Congress you voted to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, tax care of our veterans -- our veterans, we love 'em. Veterans' choice. We got veterans' choice. After 44 years, we got veterans' choice.
He voted -- thank you very much. He voted to secure our borders, stop the visa lottery horror show. Can you imagine it? This is legislation. They put names in a bin. We picked names. Do you think we're -- they're putting their finest? We get these people -- a lottery, can you believe? We want a merit system.
We don't want a lottery system. We want a merit system. And we're going to get it. And we're on our way to getting it. Need a few more votes. We got to get some Republicans. And he voted -- and he -- believe this is somebody -- he's not into the American military, but we are. We are really into the American rebuilt military.
But David is a true champion of the military. He loves our military. He loves our vets. David, get on up here, David. Come up. Come here. Remember this. A vote for David is a vote for me and our agenda to make America great again. David, come up.
Thank you, Mr. President. Wow. This is incredible. Thank you for showing up tonight. Thank you, Mr. President. It's such a pleasure to have you in Iowa. For years, presidents have made promises about E15 year round. We've got a president who delivered, and he did it. Thank you for keeping your promise, Mr. President.
Yeah! Look at the economy, 4.2 percent growth, 3.7 percent unemployment rate across the country, 2.5 percent unemployment rate here. Incredible things are happening, folks. Allowing hard-working Iowans to keep their hard-earned dollars. Opportunity, the American dream. Thank you, Mr. President. Rebuilding our military and signing into law the largest pay increase for our military in almost 10 years.
Thank you, Mr. President. Securing our border, Mr. President. Thank you. And thank you for getting us out of that bogus Iran deal. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Mr. President, for finally moving our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in Israel. And, Mr. President, you are looking out for veterans.
Thank you for that. Hey, folks. Elections are about choices, right? We can keep moving forward, or we can allow Nancy Pelosi and her hand... and her hand-picked candidates to take us backwards. We cannot go backwards to higher taxes, more government, a weaker military, and the failed policies of the past.
I need your support. We need your support. Talk to your friends. November 6th. Vote. Go to davidyoungforiowa.com to volunteer. Thank you, Mr. President. God bless you. God bless this great country. God bless Iowa. God bless you.
Thank you, David. A vote for David's far-left opponent, Cindy "Tax Me"... Remember that name, Cindy "Tax Me". It's a very good name, actually, for her. I guess it's actually Axne. But we call her "Tax Ne". That was so easy. I didn't hear that one, but I don't know if anyone's thought of it, but that's like a natural.
Is a vote for the radical agenda of Pelosi and Schumer and, of course, Maxine Waters. "Tax Me" opposed our massive tax cuts. That's why her name. She was born with the right name. And she wants a socialist takeover of health care, which is going to destroy our entire city. Cindy Axne is totally controlled by Pelosi and the extreme Washington liberals who are bankrolling her campaign, totally bankrolling her campaign.
If you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming -- can you believe this -- the speaker of the House? Then you need to vote for David Young, who is a terrific, terrific guy. Terrific guy. And you also need to vote for a great friend of mine, who really through just force of will got us to put up millions of dollars to build a dam to stop your flooding in a very important part of Iowa, Congressman Rod Blum.
Great guy. And I have to say, Rod is fighting to reform welfare, reduce crime, and continuously cut your taxes. Rod's opponent, Abby Finkenauer -- who the hell is that? Who is that? Is an extreme liberal who supports mass amnesty. Anybody like amnesty? For illegal aliens, wants to raise your taxes through the roof, and wants to take away your health care.
So you got to vote for Rod Blum. Got to vote for David Young. You've got to vote for these two characters over here who have been there. We don't even bring them up, because they're leading by so much, I said, I'm not going to waste your time. But get out and vote anyway, just in case, right? Just in -- you never know.
You never know. A majority of House Democrats have already signed up for a socialist health care plan that would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for 20 million seniors. Republicans want to protect Medicare. We're protecting it for our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it all of their lives.
Right? And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We are going to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. The Democrat agenda is radical socialism and open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. What a great idea. You know why? Because the people that work for ICE, they love our country.
But they're very tough people. Guess what? That's what we need to take care of MS-13, all the gangs. You don't want to do it. You don't want to do it. Even you don't want to do it. I don't want to do it, either. They're fantastic people. They love our country. And to them, it's a day in the office. For other people, they want no part of it. They want to turn America, these Democrats -- and that's what they want -- into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and the MS-13 killers... that we're getting out of the country, by the way, by the thousands.
Thousands. They've taken over towns in Long Island. I mean, literally. It could happen to your community. They've taken over towns in Long Island. And we go in, and we, like, liberate the towns. Can you believe -- towns that I grew up right next to. I know every one of them. And they go in and they go in and they have no fear and they take care of the situation, they get them the hell out of there or they put them in jail.
They either send them back where they came from or they put them in jail. And they liberate -- literally, can you imagine we're saying this about places in our country? They liberate towns and small cities in different places of Long Island and others. They liberate them, like we're taking over a war and we get liberated.
How sad. How pathetic. And if we didn't have ICE, it wouldn't happen. It wouldn't happen. So we have to cherish our law enforcement. We have to protect our law enforcement. The Democrat immigration policies aren't just wrong, they're lethal. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens that sneak into our country.
And Republicans stand proudly with the brave men and women of ICE and Border Patrol and our great law enforcement, including your great local law enforcement. If you want to have safe communities, if you want to have a border, then you must organize. Remember this. You don't have a border, you don't have a country, folks, OK, let's face it. Let's face it. You know, we're doing things that are incredible outside, but things are happening you won't even -- you'll see.
You'll see what happens. You take a look at what's going on with North Korea. They were ready to go to war with North Korea. Now we're getting along very nicely. It's working out very well. Look at Iran. Before I got there, Iran was going to take over the Middle East in like 12 minutes, right? Now they're trying to survive.
You got riots in every city. So if you want to really just keep up what we're doing and keep this country -- we have tremendous potential. You know, we're doing well. But we have tremendous potential to grow incredibly. When we get rid of these horrible, disgusting trade deals, with China, over the last five, six years, we've been losing $300 billion to $500 billion a year, billion.
Nobody even knows what the hell it is, it's so much. It's ending. It's ending. It's ending. And it's not just China. It's not just China. And what we do is we protect wealthy countries for nothing. For nothing. Would you say Saudi Arabia is wealthy? Yeah. Right? And I said to the king, you've got to pay.
I'm sorry. You've got to pay. We're going to protect, you've got to pay. Get the money. You've got to pay. You've got to pay! I have friends in the audience, they're good businessmen. They're looking like, absolutely. They -- but you're not a politician. A politician doesn't -- you got to pay. Japan is an immensely wealthy country.
Great people. Prime Minister Abe just had a big election, won by a landslide. He's a friend of mine. But I said, look, we're protecting Japan. They're making a fortune. They're sending us millions of cars. We're not allowed to send them -- they have barriers. We can't send them cars. But they send millions of cars into here.
They pay essentially no tax. And we subsidize their military. When I say subsidize, I'm not talking about like for 2 percent. We pay for 70 percent of their military. Nobody knows this! And I said to the prime minister, who's a great guy, I said, how come? And he honestly says, nobody ever asked. When we straighten out this, we have so much potential.
And there are many countries like that. I'm not looking at just those two. There are many, many countries like that. And you know what? We should protect people that can't protect themselves and they're getting slaughtered. It's OK. It's OK. That's OK. And we're now building by far the strongest military that we've ever had.
And the reason is... And the reason is that when you have the strongest military ever in the history of this world, nobody's going to mess with you. These big guys know it over here. These people know it. I don't want to use our military. But this is a very dangerous world. This is a sick world, in many ways, OK? It's a very, very -- I mean, I see things as president that you don't want to know about.
The things that I see, you don't want to know about. We have to be on guard for some really treacherous people that are running some places -- and we are so prepared you have no idea. We are so prepared. We are so prepared. Because this election is about security. And it's also about prosperity. Since the election... [Audience member calls out Seal Team Six] SEAL Team is right.
Who's SEAL team? The good-looking guy over there, that's good. SEAL Team, they're great. But since the election, we've created -- nobody believes this. If I would have said this when I came to Iowa many times or when I came to Nebraska many times... With your governor, with your governor, if I would have said that we would create 4.2 million new jobs, the fake news media -- look at this, it's like the Academy Awards back there... Look.
The fake news would have said, oh, what he's saying, oh, it's -- oh -- well, guess what? We created 4.2 million jobs just since the election. And... We lifted over 4 million people off of food stamps. How good is that? We've added nearly half a million manufacturing jobs. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country.
And African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. And Kanye West, who gets it... And Big Jim Brown, how do you think he'd do in the NFL today? Bum, the greatest. But they're coming over to the White House very shortly. We're going to have a little lunch and talk about it. But they get it! How do you -- how do you win when you hear those numbers?
Because the Democrats for 100 years have been promising African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asians. They've been promising everything, nothing happens. Here we are, less than two years, the best employment numbers, the best numbers they've ever had in virtually every category. Every category. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment rates have also reached all-time lows.
How do you -- how do you beat us in 2020? Governor, do you have any idea? What would you say? What would you say? We're going to do a great job. But, yeah, but we have the best numbers ever recorded. Those debates I look forward to. See, I said we were going to do that. Remember? What the hell do you have to lose?
Remember that? Right? I said we were going to do it. But now we've done it. So how's somebody going to do better? But we're going to do much better than even that. Women's unemployment rate just fell to 3.6 percent. Which is the lowest in more than 65 years. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning.
We have finalized a new fair trade deal for South Korea. They don't even talk about -- that's a big deal. We just did a deal, manufacturers, farmers. The deal was so bad. That was a Hillary Clinton deal. She said -- no, no. She was secretary of state. [Audience chants Lock her up] She made a statement today, they're doing a tour, her and her husband or something.
And she made a statement, some ridiculous -- I said, well, that's why she lost the election. She just doesn't get it. She's never gotten it. But she never got it -- so she said, we will create 250,000 jobs. And everybody was excited. Unfortunately, she was right, but it was created in South Korea, not in our country.
Just another deal, check it off. Just another horrible deal. We will create 250,000 for -- you know if she said for South Korea, at least it would have been honest, right? But we've totally renegotiated that. Under the guise of massive tariffs -- I said, if you're not going to do it, we're just going to put tariffs in, that's it. And they said, let's do it. Come on. Let's do it. Let's make a decent deal.
And we've opened it up for your farmers, for your manufacturers. We've taken a horrible deal and made it a good deal. Made it a good deal. And now we're opening up or we're going to do something where we do even better, but we're going to open up Japan for trade and the European Union, which is brutal. They are brutal.
Sounds so nice. So nice. The European Union. Sounds so nice, right? They are brutal. But that's because they've had their way. They formed in order to take advantage of us on trade. Now, we protect most of those countries. European Union, NATO. We protect most. So Germany is paying 1 percent. We are paying 4.3 percent to protect Europe.
Explain that one to me, OK, please? The numbers are horrific. But I've gotten $44 billion last year, more paid into NATO by other countries. And this year will be more than that. That's why I say, our country has such incredible potential. There's so many -- I mean, I could go through deal -- I could go through so many things, just the same thing.
They were going to build the embassy in Israel. As you know, we got approved, right? On my desk was a document to get ready to spend over $1 billion to build a building. I said, how do you spend $1 billion to build a building? I didn't look, but probably like one story, it's an embassy, right, two stories, a billion dollars.
And I said, maybe we can get a building and renovate it and fix it up real fast, and who knows? And our great -- our great ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, called. He said, you know, we have the best site in Jerusalem. And there's a beautiful building on it. And we can take just a big corner of that building, fix it up, and instead of waiting 20 or 25 years, by the time this thing got worked out, we could have it in about four months, sir.
I said, what do you mean the site's the best? He said, well, we were there early. We've had the site for many years. The building is good, but, you know, we have to renovate. So we're going to spend a billion and probably never get it open, right? And, by the way, had we spent a billion, it would end up costing $3 billion or $4 billion for -- you know, people would look at it, probably one-third the size of this room.
They'll spend $2 billion. So I said, David, how much is it going to cost to do that? And how good is the site? Site's great. And, sir, the building is set way back, which is good for purposes of security. They like that. They don't want it right on the sidewalk. I can't imagine why. Set way back. He said, sir, it's beautiful.
And it's a big site. We can do other things later. I said, how much is it going to cost? He said, sir, it's going to cost about $180,000. I told him, we'll think about it. True, $180,000. First time in my life I've ever done this. First time. Don't get angry at me. I said, David, it's too cheap. It doesn't sound good.
I never did that before. I never did it before. Like, I like to say, like Air Force One, we gave out the contract. They were going to give it out for $1.6 billion more than I gave it out for. They'll tell you. I said to Boeing, I'm not going to pay that price. And I said, I'm not paying it. Cancel the contract.
I'm not paying it. And I held a line. I said, you got to take off $1.8 billion. They called back a day later. Supposing we took off $1.6 billion? I said you have a deal, OK. I actually did that. I actually said cut it in half, OK? But we don't have to go through the whole deal. But with the -- with the -- with the embassy, I said, David, David, $180,000, it's too cheap.
We've got to spend more than that. It doesn't sound good. But, sir, I can do a really -- I said, I know you can, but it's not going to play well. You mean we took it from $1 billion to $180,000? I said, David, I said, you know what, David, make it $400,000. And use Jerusalem stone. Did anybody ever see it? It's the most beautiful stone.
And you're in Jerusalem, right? I mean, what's -- probably inexpensive. Most expensive stone when you bring it here. But you're in Jerusalem. They should have plenty of it, right? I said, David, use beautiful Jerusalem stone and let's do it. We opened it up four months later for $400,000. Can you believe it? Open.
It's open. I could tell you many of these stories. I could tell you many. I could tell you so many of these stories. There's that story, and I got 30 more we could take about. The way we spend -- he says I want to hear more. Should I give you one more of those stories? All right. All right, one story. So we like South Korea.
We've got 32,000 soldiers over there. Thank you very much, United States. They don't pay. They don't pay us, but that's OK. They're very successful. And the Obama administration gave this incredible -- it's all right. Don't worry. It's being mostly dismantled. Mostly dismantled. So my first week in office, I get there, and I notice there's this incredible THAAD system, THAAD system to knock down rockets.
Shoots down rockets, shoots down missiles, most incredible thing you've ever seen. I think they got like a 97 percent shot at it. And the company likes to say, but if you send up two missiles, you get it 100 percent. But that's expensive. I said, do it with one, right? So I get there, and brand new, they put in. I said, just out of curiosity, who pays for it? I said to a certain general, good guy, but, you know, he's not into business.
He's into winning wars, but they're not into business. They don't care. OK. He's into winning, but not into business. He's got a little business, too. So I said, so, let me ask you something. How much does that system cost? Sir, I don't know. As a businessman, you, by the way, a good businessman, you know what I'm talking about.
How much does that cost? Sir, I don't know. Who pays for it? Sir, I don't know. Now, you got to understand, the purpose of this -- it's on the border. This is in the time when we were having a little problem, you know, at the beginning. A lot of people thought we were going to war, but we're doing nicely now.
But I said, so let me get this -- we have a system that's very expensive. And we shoot down rockets that are shot from North Korea to South Korea to shoot down -- OK, so we're protecting South Korea, right? Why aren't they paying? Well, I don't know. I don't -- I said, General, immediately go and find out who's paying for it and how much.
So he goes, next morning, he comes into my office. Sir, we are an ally of South Korea. And therefore, we are paying for the system, sir. I said, I thought so. Then I said, all right, give me the bad news. Raytheon. Give me the bad news. How much is it going to cost? Sir, $1 billion. I said, whoa, whoa! So we're putting in a system that we pay for and it's going to cost $1 billion in order to protect an immensely wealthy country that makes all of your television sets, right?
Samsung, LG, I order a lot of them, South Korea. And I'm trying to figure that out, Steve King, as a true conservative, but I'm trying to figure it out. So we do this, and I said, do me a favor. Go back to the country. Renegotiate that deal. That's not a good deal. But, sir, the Obama administration has already agreed to it. I said I don't care if they agreed to it. I couldn't care less if they agreed to it. I don't care.
So that's the second or third story. I could go on all night, but I want to get the hell out of here, OK? Because I thought I was coming to Iowa, and there's more people from Nebraska. Right, Pete Ricketts? Pete Ricketts. Governor Ricketts. We love you both. We love you both. After years of rebuilding other nations, I could give you 30 stories.
I -- I could give you 100 stories like that -- we're finally rebuilding our nation. That's what we're doing. America is not being taken advantage of anymore. America is being respected again. With Republicans in Congress, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. Big numbers.
So important for the farmers and small business. To save your family farms and ranches, we've virtually eliminated the estate tax, also known as the death tax. So now if you like your children or love your children, you can leave your beautiful farm to your children and they won't have to pay any taxes. They won't have to go to your local banker, borrow money, and end up losing the farm, which was happening.
Now you won't have any -- you guys know that, that's a big deal -- that's a big deal, Jeff and Steve and everybody. That's a big deal, because people were leaving their farms, they go out, they mortgage their farms, then they end up -- the kids end up going through hell and losing their farms. So now you won't have to go to the bank, borrow money, put a mortgage on. But here's the thing.
If you don't like your kids, or if you don't love your kids, it doesn't have any impact on you. Sell the farm. Enjoy yourselves and relax. Don't give them anything. Don't give them anything if you don't like them. Don't give them anything! We're reducing the price of prescription drugs to help critically ill patients access life-saving treatment we passed.
And right to try. Right to try. We all know what it is. We have right to try now. For years, people wanted to access some of these cures that worked, but they can't get approved, because it's a long process which we've cut way down. Right to try. They were terminally ill and they couldn't get treatment of something that may work.
We just signed right to try. And these guys helped a lot, right? Steve, Jeff, everybody. They helped a lot. David was great, David Young. So now you get the right to try. People used to travel all over the world if they had money. If they didn't have money, they'd go home. They had no hope. Now they can get treatment.
They sign a document, they can get treatment. They tried for 40 years to get that passed. We got it passed. Right to try. I love it. We also passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor. Big thing. Forty-four years. Forty-four years, they've tried to get it passed. People are waiting on line for 12 days, for 20 days, for 28 days.
People aren't that sick. By the time they see the doctor, seriously, they're terminally ill. They couldn't see a doctor. Now we have the right to let them go see a private doctor. We pay for the bills. It's great for them. It actually is saving for us. Forty-four years. Forty-four years. Forty-four years.
I thought it was my idea, but then I came back and I said -- what a great idea. They said, we've been trying to get it passed for 44 years. I mean, how simple? Right? Forty-four years. But because of guys like this, right, Steve, Jeff, everybody, Governor, you were incredible, Pete Ricketts. You helped so much.
All of you guys. And the landmark V.A. accountability law. You couldn't fire anybody. There were -- literally, there were sadists working for the V.A. There were bad people. There were thieves. Horrible people. You couldn't fire them. We passed -- I think it's 46, 47 years. Look, I hate to say it. Union problems.
All sorts of problems. Civil service problems. Pretty strong lobby, right? We got it passed, 44, 46 years. And now when we catch people that aren't taking care of our veterans, we look at them, we say, Jim, you're fired. Get out of here! It's true. It's true. [Audience chants Trump] Now, you know, they don't spin the cameras.
Tell this -- I said in the beginning to spin. Nobody does it. Because they don't want to show how big these crowds are. They -- no, I'm telling you. They don't want to show it. They don't want to show it. Look, they're not spinning. Do you see one camera turning? No, they don't want to show all these people.
They don't want to show it. I don't see -- look, I don't see one camera turning. They don't want to show them. Our great first lady -- I come home, I said, did they show the crowd? No, but it sounded massive. Right? It sounded -- sounded -- looks like an Iowa -- Iowa state or Nebraska football game. That's what it sounds like.
That's what it sounds like. Right? That's what it sounds like. So my wife would say, they didn't show the crowd, but it sure as hell sounded big. You know, when you have crowds like this, you can't cheat on the sound. I mean, it's a lot of people. But they cheat, because they -- they never show the crowd.
We secured... $716 billion to fully rebuild our great American military. And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American Air Force, the Space Force. Very important. Very important. We got to get that done, Congressman. Everybody wants that. So important. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America.
They apologized. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Iowa and Nebraska. And we are proudly standing up for our great national anthem. [Audience chants USA] And, by the way, speaking of the NFL... No, it's OK. But you know, for years, the NFL had a big problem with Canada and the Super Bowl and rights.
It's a complicated thing, but it doesn't matter. And I heard about the problem. And we were dealing with them on a much, much, much bigger issue. And the NFL is a great American company. And I told my people, give the damn NFL problem solved. It took them about two minutes. And I got a call from the commissioner.
I thought he was calling about the flag. I thought he was calling to say we have fully agreed that we are all going to stand at attention with our hand on our heart, helmet on the ground, and salute -- he didn't. But a good guy. He called me to thank me. You know why I did that? I did that -- nobody told me to do it. I did that because I knew they had a problem.
And it's a great American company. Whether we like it, don't like it, doesn't matter. It's a great American company. And so I got it done. I got it done. Took us like two minutes. And you know what? Now the players will be paid more money and they'll still hate me. Isn't that terrible? They'll still hate Trump.
And they get more money. But that's OK. That's why -- that's why guys like Jim Brown and Kanye and so many others like me. But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote or early voting. Get out and vote or early voting.
Vote for Governor Kim Reynolds. Vote -- I thought you were coming here as my guest. Pete, I thought you were coming here -- just today -- come on over, Pete. Vote for Pete Ricketts. I didn't know you were bringing half of Nebraska, Pete. Vote for Congressman Rod Blum and Congressman David Young. Don't bother with these two guys.
They're going to win by -- vote for them, too, please. Vote for them, too. That's right, Steve. They're going to vote for you guys. Thank you. And thank you. Vote for Republicans. You're doing the right thing, because a vote for us is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products that are made right here in the USA.
That's what we're doing. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, division, and destruction. And you know what else? You know what else? And weakness, because it's weakness.
And to reclaim our magnificent destiny as Americans. To everyone in this great room tonight, to every citizen watching across our land -- and there are a lot of them -- this is your time to choose. So important. Got to get out. You've got to vote. It will all be taken away if they get control, including -- they'll start appointing Supreme Court judges that you will not want.
We'll have justices that you will say, how did this happen? You got to get out and vote. It's time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness. Never forget that in 2016 we had the greatest movement in the history of our country.
And they won't challenge that. They even admit that. They're not happy about it. They're not happy. But that was the greatest movement in the history of our country. It is not up to the media or the fake news or the pundits to decide your fate. It is up to you. You have the power. With your vote, you can do so much, but you can defend your family, defend your community, defend your country, defend your rights, your faith, and your dignity.
Loyal citizens like you, Iowa and Nebraska, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power back to the American patriots, which is you. These states were settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women. The women actually were stronger than men, but I don't want to get into that.
I don't want to get into that! The women are stronger than the men. I've said it for a long time. Sorry, men. Sorry, you guys. You know what I'm talking about, right? They're all nodding. You're right. Who have braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home right here. They didn't have a lot of money.
They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They loved their families. They loved their country. And they loved their God. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage.
For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory.
Because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you, Nebraska. Thank you. Get out and vote.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello, Dallas, it's great to be with you tonight. Thank you, and I am thrilled to be here deep in the heart of Texas, where we just opened a beautiful new Louie Vuitton plant. When I'm with the freedom-loving patriots of the Lone Star State I love it. There has never been a better time to be a proud Texan and there's never been a better time to be a proud American.
There never has, there never has. So I came from a small town, Alvarado, Texas, where we celebrated the incredible revival of American manufacturing and we opened up some beautiful places. I'll tell you this place is doing great and created in a very short period of time, an extra 1,000 jobs for Texas. Since my election, we've created 775,000 new jobs across the state, including 70,000 Texas manufacturing jobs, they said those jobs had disappeared, didn't they huh, hey man?
Our country is once again living by two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. The economy is booming, our people are prospering, our country is thriving, and our nation is stronger than ever before, but the more America achieves the more hateful and enraged these crazy Democrats become. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Crazy.
They're crazy. They're, crazy. At stake in this fight is the survival of American democracy itself and don't kid yourself, that's what they want. They are destroying this country, but we will never let it happen not even close. For three straight years, radical Democrats have been trying to overthrow the results of a great, great election, maybe, maybe the greatest election in the history of our country, and they want to impose an extreme agenda.
They cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box. They're not going to win. They're not and even going to -- they won't come close in 2020. They know it. They know it. They're not going to win it. They say, let's see, what's another idea? What's another idea? How do we win this election? [Inaudible] You know, I really don't believe anymore that they love our country.
I don't believe it. [Audience chants "Four more years"] Crazy Nancy. Think of that. That crazy Nancy, she is crazy. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And shifty Schiff, how about this guy? How about this guy? [Audience shouts "Boo"] He makes up my conversation which was perfect. He makes up my conversation, he sees what I said.
It doesn't play well because it was perfect, so he made up a totally false conversation with the Ukrainian President and we caught him cold. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Everybody knew it anyway. See? We did one thing, you always have to do the unexpected. They never thought I'd release the conversation with the Ukrainian President.
I want to get him before Congress and I want to see what he has to say. You know they say he has immunity. Why would you have immunity for outright fraud? Why do you have immunity? Why? He's a fraud. We're fighting a campaign against leftists, socialists, and globalists who want to return to reckless wars, open borders, rampant crime, and totally disastrous one-way trade deals.
We're changing that one around very quickly. They believe America is the world's piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy, military, and defense of every other nation in the world, but our own. [Audience shouts "Boo"] It's not happening anymore. Our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens, and you know, that's what's been happening, and that's why 2016 was so important, and that's why 2020 -- I can never say it's more important, but you know, it's like the roots of a tree.
You plant a baby tree, it's got a catch, get that extra time. We'll have more tax cuts, we'll have even -- I'll tell you what, we have rebuilt our military. What we've done has never been done before. The do-nothing Democrats have betrayed our country and that great betrayal is over. We are finally again, and we've been doing it now for almost three years, can you believe we've been doing this for three years?
Can you believe it? I've been a politician for three years. I can't believe that. I never thought I'd be called a politician. I don't like it, but it is what it is, but we're finally, again, putting America first. The radical Democrats want to destroy America, as we know it. They want to indoctrinate our children and teach them that America is a sinful wicked nation.
You see that happening all the time and I know it from personal experience what they want to teach your kids, not good. They come home, mommy, daddy, this is what I learned, and you're going, oh no, don't tell me. Let's get them into another school fast. They want to disarm law-abiding citizens, they want to take your guns away [Audience shouts "Boo"] and they want to win so far left judges to shred our Constitution.
It's not happening. They want to tear down symbols of faith and drive Christians and religious believers from the public square. They want to silence your voices on social media and they want the government to censor, muzzle and shut down conservative voices. You know that. If they didn't hate our country, they wouldn't be doing this to our country.
They wouldn't be doing it because they know better. They know better. As an example, we're building a great wall along the Southern border and it's going up rapidly, going up. [Audience chants "Build that wall"] And you know five years ago, almost every one of them wanted a wall. Until I came along, and I said, we're going to build a great walk because they could never get it done and then they stopped the funding.
They made it almost impossible. Few people would have been able to do what we did, but we got it from here, and we got it from there, and we got it from all over the place, and we're building that sucker right now, and it's having a tremendous effect already. Not easy. Highest level. Everything we said it would be. It's moving rapidly, although, the fake news back there, they don't want to talk about it. [Audience shouts "Boo"] They don't want to talk about it. Look at all those cameras, do you believe it? Look at all those red lights, don't worry, I won't say anything bad about your network.
Because a lot of times I get ready to do a number on these phony networks. And you know, you see those red lights go off, off, off, off. They don't want their viewers to see it. But that's OK. I'm not going to say it tonight, I'm going to say your legitimate media. I don't actually mean that. But you look at that, but look at all those cameras.
You know that's like the Academy Awards used to be because -- before it failed. Do you know why it failed? Do you know why it failed? Because they came after us. That's why it failed. It failed because they had stupid people saying horrible things about us, stupid, stupid people. They are stupid people and their ratings have dropped like a rocket and I love seeing it. I'm telling you.
Love it. But no matter how hard they try, they will fail, because the people of Texas and the people of America will never surrender our freedom to those people right there. [Audience chants "USA"] We will stand strong for family, faith, God, and for our country. Last week, a very dumb Democrat candidate for President.
That's the end of him in this state, pledged to revoke the tax-exempt status of many churches and religious charities. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And by the way, that was after a few weeks ago, he said excuse me, we're going to take your guns away. That doesn't work well and I called him, right. Remember the flailing arms?
Nobody noticed it. I noticed it. The flairer, do you remember he was flailing all over the place? I said why is this guy hot? John Cornyn is going to win so easily, just like Ted Cruz won. He's going to win, no matter what happens, but John Cornyn is not talking about Bado anymore, because Bado in a few Short weeks, got rid of guns and got rid of religion.
Those are not two good things in Texas to get rid of, and I will never allow the federal government to be used to punish Americans for their religious beliefs, and I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon, except in the case of myself, where they use it against me. The radical left tolerates no dissent, it permits no opposition, it accepts no compromise.
These people are crazy and it has absolutely no respect for the will of the American people. First, it was the Russia hoax. Then it was this smearing, which continues that disgraceful, disgusting smearing of a fine man, Justice Kavanaugh. And now, they continue the outrageous impeachment witch hunt with nothing, with nothing.
They come after me, but what they're really doing is they're coming after the Republican Party, and what they're really, really doing is they're coming after and fighting you, and we never lose. I'm fighting for everyone who believes in the values, traditions, and principles that have made our nation the greatest in the history of the world, and I have to say this: we are far greater now than ever before.
You go back four years, you go back seven, six, eight, even you go back into another administration, you go back 10 and 12 years. Where were you compared to where you are right now? So we must hold the Democrats accountable for their lies and their corruption. They are corrupt people and we must show and vote and we have to go out and we have to win this election coming up. It's going to be a landslide and we have to make it a landslide.
Today's do-nothing Democrats, they don't do anything. Where's the USMCA? Everybody wants it. The Democrats even want it and crazy Nancy won't let anybody vote on it. She's nuts. Today's Democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed. It's not just like let's win, you know, I have to say this. The Republicans and I'm not sure I like this, because my life hasn't been this way, but the Republicans play a much softer game they really do. When all of our stars, and we have great stars, when they went to our Speaker of the House at the time, and they asked for subpoenas, oh, let's take it easy.
Let's take -- OK, I mean, I get that too. She hands them out like it's cookies. Here -- some -- I heard a commentator who happens to be standing right there the other day, doesn't like us at all, but, but said, I've never seen anyone hand out so many subpoenas. [Audience shouts "Boo"] I have people getting subpoenas I never heard of and said who are those people?
Never saw anything like it, it's a disgrace what they're doing to our country? And we became, because of what they do, not the Republicans and not what we've done, because what they've done and what they see. When people come to my office, which is now the Oval Office, which is your office too. Presidents, Prime Ministers, Kings, Queens, I hate to say it sometimes, dictators, they just don't like to go by that title.
They say, sir, congratulations, sir, on what you've done. Congratulations on what you've done. It's incredible. Your economy is the greatest on earth and let me tell you it: if my crooked opponent would have won the election, right now, China would be by far the number one nation from an economic standpoint in the world.
We've gone up trillions of dollars, they've gone down trillions of dollars. And we are so far, number one, so far, that they'll never catch us if we are smart right here. [Audience chants "USA"] But the do-nothing Democrats believe anyone who opposes them has to be crushed. They don't want to just beat them.
They don't want to just beat them. These are sick people, they want to crush these people, the anger, the hatred, and that any lie or crime or corruption is justified. So Schiff gets up and makes up my statement. He makes it up 100%, and then he said, he didn't speak to the whistleblower. No, we didn't see the whistleblower.
And what about the whistleblower? The whistleblower got it all wrong. Who's the whistleblower? Who's the whistleblower? Who is the whistleblower? We have to know. Is the whistleblower as spy and who is the IG that did this? All he had to do is look at the tape or look at the -- what they wrote down. The transcribed version of the phone call, compare that to the whistleblowers account, and you see it had nothing to do with it. So why does the IG allow a thing like this to happen to our country?
Why? Why? There are a lot of bad people out there but one by one we're advancing, one by one. [Inaudible] Just look at the terrible foreign corruption of the Bidens. [Audience shouts "Boo"] I hate to talk about him, do you know why? I don't think the guy's got a chance, sleepy Joe. I don't think he's got a chance.
I don't see it. I don't know. I've got these great brilliant Senators over here. I have all these Congressmen over here, fellas. I don't think he has a chance. I'd like him to. I'd like him to. You know, I thought Pocahontas was gone, left in embers. You got to give her credit, those embers they kept going, going, going.
Now, it looks like she's doing better [Inaudible] but I don't think Joe has a chance. But did you see the other night, where CNN, or in a totally unsubstantiated statement, the President said this about you, we're so sorry he said that. His son walked out with $1.5 billion from China. These were not the same Chinese people I just dealt with.
I will tell you that. But Joe Biden was in charge of Ukraine policy while his son, with absolutely no energy experience, just got thrown out of the Navy like a dog, was paid massive sums of money by a Ukrainian energy company. Do you know what that's called? It's called a pay-off, folks. He didn't know energy at all, do nothing about energy.
They hired him, paying him massive amounts of money, much more than the $50,000 a month that you heard about. That's a lot, that's a lot, but much more. Joe Biden made them go out and fired the prosecutor on tape, but they don't want to show the tape. I had to put it up on a social media site. They don't want to show the tape where he was bragging.
They're not going to get this money unless they get rid and boom they got rid of the prosecutor. He was investigating the son and the son's company, got rid of them. Now, that's what you call, quid pro quo. While these charges are totally unsubstantiated -- these are the fake newsers out there. And then Biden flew, think of it. He goes into a tough place.
We just made such a great deal with China. Think of this, my guy said, if we could get $20 billion in agricultural product, that would be good. The most China ever did was $16 billion for our farmers, OK? We're just talking about the farmers. We did banking, we did everything, but we're talking about them.
The most they ever did was $20 billion of product from our farmers, our great farmers, our patriot farmers, our farmers that never left us even though they were being targeted by China. They never left me. So they wanted $20 billion and China agreed, and I said, nope, no good. I want $50 billion, not $20 billion, $50 billion.
So, my guys say, we have a problem, sir, our farmers cannot produce that much. It's true. I said tell them to go out and get bigger tractors, right? The John Deere case, Caterpillar, all American, only American tractors. We only buy American tractors. Go out and get bigger. So now, China's agreed and they've already started buying.
Hopefully, the agreement gets signed sometime prior to a big summit that we have with President Xi and others in Chile. So that's set about four weeks but think of this. They said, sir, they can't produce $50 billion. I said I want the farmers to tell me -- remember the story about winning? We're going to win so much.
We're going to the White House. We're going to tell the President, sir, we just can't stand winning. The state of Texas, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, they're going to come into my office. Sir, we just, just can't stand this winning in Texas anymore. It's too much. We can't handle it. Well, that's what I want from the farmers.
I want the farmers to say, I want the farmers to say, sir, we just can't produce that much product. We can't do it, sir. And I'm going to say, yes, you can and they're going to say, no, we can't. I'm going to say, yes, you can and they're going to go out and they're going to take in $50 billion from China as opposed to $20 billion.
That's what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen. But they were great. They stuck with us through thick and thin. Now, it's really working out for a lot of different groups, and in the meantime, we've taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs and China's eating the cost because they devalued their currency and they put money out, tens of billions of dollars.
It's cost us nothing, billions and billions and billions -- and you know what I did for the farmer? During the lean times, I gave them $16 billion last year and $12 billion the year before, $28 billion altogether. It came out of the tariffs and I had a lot of money left over and nobody complained. And you know, our farmers didn't want that money, our farmers didn't want it. True story.
Everybody comes for money, countries come for, everybody wants money, right? They all want our money. The farmers said, sir, we don't want this money, it's the subsidy, we don't want it. I said, no, it's not a subsidy, you're being targeted unfairly. They said, no, sir, it's a subsidy. This is true. I had 35 farmers in the Oval Office, incredible people, they didn't want it. They said, sir, just give us a level playing field.
So now I gave them a field that's more that level. It's level like this, nice and easy, nice and easy, but the farmers, I call them the great patriots, the farmers. They -- I never lost them. They always said, you know, yeah, in trouble, I got a problem, but this should have been done many, many years ago by other Presidents and other leaders.
[Inaudible] And we lose, for many years, $500 billion a year with China and many other countries, we lose billions. We lose with everybody but that's all changing now. But we lose $500 billion, not million, $500 million's a lot, right? We lose $500 billion, and you know what, it's a disgrace that that was allowed to go on for 25 years.
It was a disgrace, disgrace. But now we're taking in billions of dollars. They've had the worst year they've had in 27 years and we're having the best year we've ever had, so that's good, that's good. So Biden flew with Hunter on Air Force Two. They flew to China, Hunter walked out of the plane, had a quick meeting, walked away with $1.5 billion, and these characters back there said, oh, that's, OK, there's no problem.
[Audience shouts "Boo"] Can you imagine if Don or Eric Trump or Ivanka Trump was here someplace, right here? And by the way, our great First Lady is home watching this, she said this is the most exciting thing I've seen in a long time. She's a great First Lady, doing a great job. She's doing a great job.
We're doing a great job. The whole country now is doing a great job. So, Biden takes a $1.5 billion and he goes on and he allows China to rip us off. Remember he said a year ago? No, no, China's good. They've done nothing wrong. They're wonderful people. They are wonderful people. I don't blame China by the way, I blame our leaders for allowing this horrible -- you know what and pillage, it's the R-word.
You know what and pillage. You know what word I'm talking about, right? I don't want to use it because they'll say it's a horrible word that Trump used. So, the Bidens got rich while America got robbed. Tonight, we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the Democrat Party and nobody ever pays the price with the Democrats.
They're so deep-seated. They never paid the price. They never paid but maybe soon that will start. You know, we've had a lot of -- we've had a lot of Obama people and Clinton people and some, to be honest with you, we've had some pretty bad Republicans down deep that didn't exactly love us, but slowly they're getting out.
They have all sorts of protections but some -- he says get rid of them. Yeah, we're trying. Get rid of them. But their partner in the whole thing is the fake-news media. That's the problem. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Because the Democrats and the fake-news media, it's a partnership, remember that, and you see it all the time, and I've never seen it to this extent.
You know when I won in the primaries, and then I won the election, I was treated horribly by the media, horribly. And then, when I won the election, we had the greatest night, one of the highest-rated nights in the history of television all over the world, and I won and I said, oh, the great thing. I said to Ivanka, I said to the First Lady, I said to anybody that would listen, I said listen, this is so great.
Finally, finally, we, all of us, we're going to be respected by the media. And you know what happened? They got worse, they're worse now than they ever have been. They're crooked as hell. They're worse now than they've ever been. They're crooked. [Audience shouts "Boo"] The only message these radicals -- and they are radical lefties, will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020, save that date.
With your help, we will win back the House, we will keep the Senate, and we will keep the White House in numbers like they haven't seen in a long, long time. Joining us tonight are many terrific Republican leaders and they are terrific, and frankly, if they're not, I'm not going to introduce them, OK? But we have some great leaders and you have great leaders in Texas, great leaders, and they love Texas.
So a friend of mine, a guy that a lot of people weren't so sure -- we had this unbelievable relationship. In fact, when Ted Cruz held a rally in Washington, he said could you come to my rally? And everybody thought, these people thought, that was strange. They said to me, well, when is the fighting between these two because we really like each other?
When is the fighting going to start, right Ted? They said when is the fighting going to start? And I said don't worry, it'll start and when it does it's going to be vicious and it was vicious and now we love each other again. He's great, Ted Cruz. And he had a great victory against the man that spent almost $100 million.
That's a lot of money. He spent almost $100 million but that was a great victory. Thank you, Ted. Another man who is currently running against somebody, I kept thinking, maybe Bado will jump in because he's at zero right now. We hope he's going to jump in, remember, no religion and no guns. I think that's not good.
Oh and I think, he's like pretty light on oil production too. But a man, and John, I have no idea who you're running against but nobody's going to be able to beat John Cornyn, who's, a good man, a good man. Thank you, John, and we have a lot of Congresspeople here. We have a woman, who's fantastic, who's been a fan of ours right from the beginning, Kay Granger.
Thank you, Kay. We have a man who's, smart as hell, and he is tough, and he is mean and nasty, but he loves this state, and he's only mean and nasty because he wants to defend you and me, and all of the horrible things that we all go through, Louie Gohmert. Louie is a great guy, but a great friend of mine, I'll tell you, once -- once we got him on board, he wouldn't leave us no matter what.
And he had Muller and everybody figured out long before anybody else had it figured out right, Louie? A person who has been an incredible ally, again, who loves your state, Randy Weber. Thank you, Randy. Great job. Thank you. One of the best lawyers you'll ever find. He's slick, he's smooth, but boy, he's loyal, he's, talented, and he's got them all buffaloed because they're not as good as him, John Ratliff.
Thank you, John. A man I saw on television last night defending me, brilliantly defending me, I actually don't like doing this usually, but I tweeted out, I said, thank you very much, Brian Babin. That was a great defense. I appreciate it. Thank you, Brian. That was great last night. So, I put a tweet out because it's easier than making a phone call and talking for a half-hour.
Thanks, Brian. I just said thanks, and you know what, he'd rather have that to actually, right? And Lance Gooden, special person, Lance Gooden. Thank you, Lance. Thank you, Lance. And Lance was one of 60 people that stuck in there. He was unbelievable. And Ron Wright, thank you, Ron. Great job, great job.
These are great people. These are great people along with Republican Party chairs and all of these total winners. Here's one, Ronna McDaniel, I'll, tell you what. You know Ronna was the Head of Michigan, Michigan hadn't been won by a Republican for decades and it was tough. They all said you couldn't win Michigan, I said why?
We're getting these massive crowds. Why? And she was in charge of Michigan, and I said, I want you to do me a favor find out who this woman is. She's driving me crazy. She calls me just one more trips, one more trip. Who is she? Who is she? And it was Ronna and we won the state of Michigan. We won. And when it came time, when it came time to picking somebody to head the RNC, Republican National Committee, I said what about that woman that drove me crazy from Michigan, and it was Ronna and she's done a fantastic job.
Thank you. Thank you, Ronna. Thank you. She's fantastic. And a great Governor from your state, he's a great, great man, and a friend of mine, and together with you here, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. When you had a hurricane, two years ago now, they still keep calling me for money. Sir, could you give us another -- when the Governor called up, Dan was there?
You know, thank you for being so generous to Texas, sir. The hurricane, it was a big one, it was a bad one, a lot of water dumped. I think the biggest dump of water, remember? It kept going in and out, in and out our, our Coast Guard saved 16,000 lives, thank you. But it kept going in and out, water, water, and finally, I get a call, I paid billions and billions of dollars to the state.
Like numbers, my people are driving me crazy. I get a call from the Governor and Dan is there. Where's Dan, is he here? Where's Dan? Dan, Dan Patrick. And the two of them call me, and then I had Ted Cruz on my back and had John Cornyn on my back and I had the Congressman calling, it was brutal. It wasn't even fair.
And they said, sir, thank you for being so generous on the hurricane. They made a fortune. You made a fortune on the hurricane. Thank you for being so generous, sir. Sir, we want one more small request, just a small -- it's not much and we appreciate you listening to us. We want to build a dam in the ocean, so that if we ever have another hurricane, sir, the water won't be able to come in to where it used to, in all of the areas that it came into, sir.
Do you think we could do it and I said how much? It's only $10 billion -- $10 billion? Right, Ted? Right? $10 billion they wanted, and you know the way they sell it, and it's so good, they're salesmen, they're incredible salesmen. They say it's only $10 billion. I'm supposed to be happy, oh, let's see, could we give Texas an extra $10 billion for some, some crazy thing that may work, and it may not, right?
Now, they're great people, they love your state. RNC Co-Chairman, Tommy Hicks, a real friend of ours. Thank you, Tommy. And our great campaign manager, the most sophisticated man with a computer you've ever seen. Remember they used to say with Hillary, her campaign is so sophisticated. Then after she lost, they said, Trump's campaign was so sophisticated.
And remember, she spent like six times more on this stuff than we did. You know in the old days, my father taught me if you can spend less that's a good thing, not a bad thing, right? My father said if you can spend less -- So we spent much less than Hillary, crooked Hillary, crooked Hillary. [Inaudible] Where are those e-mails, Hillary?
They may find those 33,000 e-mails. They're looking. They may find those deleted e-mails. They may find them. Remember the e-mails, that 33,000 e-mails covering her gym and her daughter's wedding, 33,000 -- that's a lot of e-mails for a wedding and working out. [Inaudible] But Brad Parscale did a great job.
Thank you, Brad. Thank you. Thank you, Brad. And Secretary of Commerce, one of the legends of Wall Street, he was really like amazing, and he is doing an incredible job, Wilbur Ross. Thank you, Wilbur, smart guy. And a friend of mine, he's another one, he was so tough. He was nasty, man -- boy, he hit me during the campaign.
I said that guy's ruthless and when it was sort of over, there was nobody more gracious, and I called him, I made him Secretary of Energy. He's done a phenomenal job and Rick Perry couldn't have done a better job. True, true, and he's going to be leaving at the end of the year, and probably coming back here.
Whenever he does, it's going to be successful, but he spent three years with us, and I want to thank you, Rick. What a job you've done. Thank you. What a job he's done. He was also a great Governor of Texas, that you know. In everything we do, we're fighting for the faithful citizens of this country. This includes putting a stop to the catastrophic era of endless wars.
Endless wars, they don't stop, they don't stop, they go on forever. We become policemen, we end up becoming police, were policing these countries. That's not what it's about. We've spent $8 trillion in the Middle East, thousands of American soldiers have lost their lives, tens of thousands more have been severely wounded, and in all fairness, the other side has lost millions of people, millions, millions of people, think of it. These wars brought mass chaos, instability, destruction, and death.
Today, we choose a different path. We had tremendous success today. I don't know if you've seen it. Look, we've built in the last three years, we've built the strongest military by far. When I -- and I tell the story, I was embarrassed to tell it, but now I'll tell it. When I first got in, a General told me, we could have had a conflict with someone, said, sir, we don't have ammunition.
And I said, I never want to hear a President -- I just never want to hear somebody have that statement made to them again as President of the United States, we don't have ammunition. Think of how bad, now we have so much ammunition, we don't know what to do with it. And as you all know, I guess, you've been watching today, I sent Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo to lead an American delegation to meet with President Erdogan of Turkey.
They got there today and it did work without spilling a drop of American blood, not one drop of American blood. We've all agreed on a pause or a ceasefire in the border region of Syria, and it was unconventional what I did. I said, they're going to have to fight a little while, sometimes you have to let them fight a little while, then people find out how tough the fighting is. These guys know right up here, these guys know, right?
Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids in a lot, you got to let them fight, and then you pull them apart. But it was unconventional but they fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious, and the Kurds, who are our friends and Turkey's our friend, but they fought. It was tougher, I mean it was nasty, and you couldn't make a deal for 15, think of it, for 15 years, 20 years, they couldn't make a deal.
The Kurds didn't want to move, Turkey didn't want to budge, and Turkey was having a lot of bad things happen from this region. In all fairness to Turkey, they were having a lot of bad -- but they didn't want -- now all of a sudden, they're fighting, and it's not fun having bullets going all over the place.
And we went there and we said, we want a pause and the Kurds have been terrific. They're going to move back a little bit, we're going to keep ISIS all nice and locked up, OK? We're going to find more of them. Turkey's all set and President Erdogan was great and we're going to take the worst sanctions and tariffs and everything that I put on the country.
We put the worst, I mean, I don't think they could have economically survived, but that doesn't matter, President Erdogan was a gentleman. He understood it. But without a little tough love, you know what tough love is, right? Without a little tough love, there would have never made this deal. President Obama lost a million people in the area, a million people, a million people [Audience shouts "Boo"] so now, we're doing a -- during a five-day period, we're going to see if we can get it all finalized, and I think it will be. I think it will be. So Turkey's going to be happy, the Kurds are going to be happy, ISIS is going to be unhappy.
We'll deal with whoever we have to deal with but we'll get it done, and it's a great tribute to a lot of very talented people, and thank you to Vice President Pence, and thank you to Mike Pompeo. Good job, good job and they're traveling back to our country by night. They're traveling back and they'll be back soon and we'll have a big conference on it. But it was a terrific thing and we've taken care of a lot of religious persecution.
We added that in, a lot of things are in that agreement that nobody ever thought possible. So, we have to fundamentally change our approach to Homeland Security. As an example, in that example, nobody would have ever done that. You have to be a little bit different to do it that way. I took a lot of heat, even from some of our Congressmen, even from some of our Senators, but now, they're all happy, and I'm happy with them.
I'm happy with them. Now, I don't know what about the Democrats, the Democrats will say, oh, what a terrible -- anything we do, the Democrats will criticize. If I said, like on the China deal, we get Beijing for $1, they would say what a terrible deal. It just doesn't work with them. You know the wall, we spent so much time with them in the wall, and I realized about two weeks ago, all I had to do was say, we will never build a wall, and they would have come through, and they said, we demand that you build it. It would have been so much easier, right?
It would have been so much easier, Ted. It would have been so much easier. American combat troops should not be at the center of ancient sectarian conflicts all over the world. Bring our soldiers back home, bring our soldiers back home. [Audience chants "USA"] The same people pushing us to fight endless wars overseas want us to open our borders to mass migration from these war-torn and terror-afflicted regions.
Their policies would import terrorism right onto our shores with American issued visas. Oh, isn't that wonderful? And by the way, the Democrats want open borders. They want everybody to flow in. They want those caravans to flow in, the caravan, and they wouldn't get rid of the loopholes. But you know what?
Mexico's been great. Mexico, today, had 27,000 soldiers on our border and we've stopped this horrible migration of people, and many of them are bad people. You know when countries send them up, they're not sending their finest, OK? Use your heads, They're not sending their finest. You've got to see some of the people but now we send them back, and by the way, ISIS fantastic, they've taken out thousands and thousands of MS-13 killers.
They've taken thousands of killers and brought them back. And now, we've made deals with Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador and Mexico, but we've made deals now where we can bring back -- there are 45,000 people waiting in Mexico, but it's going to be very tough for these people ever to get back. When did you ever hear that?
It used to have no people waiting in Mexico, they just fled. Our borders are getting strong. When the wall is complete, they'll be as strong as any borders anywhere in the world. My administration believes in a simple principle, the best way to keep foreign terrorists out of America is to deny them, just deny them admission in the first place.
It's really pretty simple and that is why I've imposed, and we had passed, and we won at the United States Supreme Court, a travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries and place. But if Democrats seize power, they would throw the floodgates wide open, wide open. We would have people coming into our country.
Look at what's going on in California and the people of California they want it. They say come into California, we'll give you free healthcare, free education, why wouldn't -- I may even move to California if they keep going? No, but all it does is, it brings everybody in. What's wrong with these people?
We're rebuilding our military stronger than ever before and we are not going to deplete it again on stupid, senseless, endless wars. We've invested more than $2.5 trillion restoring our armed forces and all of it was built in the USA, and that includes approving the construction of almost 200 F35 fighters, stealth, stealth, and many of them are built right here, right here.
You know that, right, in Fort Worth. As we restore our security, we're also restoring our prosperity. America is winning again and America is respected again. And by the way, I have to say this, so outside, they have close to 30,000 people, and I wonder if I could ask the Fire Marshal, fill up this little area, let him in. You know they have a certain max, we broke the record tonight.
[Inaudible] Good place. [Audience chants "USA"] Last month, unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years, 7 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election. What a great -- 1.3 million children have been lifted out of poverty. Think of that and African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels in history.
Our great Hispanic American population has reached a poverty level which is an all-time low in U.S. history. And after years of stagnation, wages for Hispanic-Americans are rising fast, up nearly 8% since my election, and everybody in the fake news would have said, that's absolutely impossible. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Median-income, think of this, median-income for Hispanic-Americans has surpassed $50,000 a year for the first time ever.
With Republicans in Congress, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reform by far in American history. By the way, the Democrats want to raise your taxes you know. I don't mean a little bit. I don't mean a little bit. I mean like, double them up, triple em up, and it still won't pay for the nonsense they want.
We eliminated a record number of regulations and we ended the war on a thing called American Energy which is very good for Texas. Since my election, natural gas production in Texas has increased 35%, and oil production has increased by 60%, 60, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.
Whoa, yet every major Democrat running for President wants to abolish all production of oil and natural gas. I think they want to go to windmills. Windmills, you know? Darling, I want to watch Trump speak tonight. We can't, darling, the wind isn't blowing. They want windmills. In other words, they want to annihilate your Texas economy.
Can you imagine? [Audience shouts "Boo"] No more oil, no more natural. So, here we have a few people right? No guns, no religion, no oil, no natural gas, Abraham Lincoln could not win Texas under those circumstances. Couldn't do it. Couldn't do it, Ted. Couldn't do it, Louie. Abraham Lincoln, honest Abe, couldn't do it Louie, right?
[Inaudible] Remember, I used to say, I can be more Presidential. Look. I've always said I could be more Presidential than any President in history, except for honest Abe Lincoln when he's wearing the hat, that's tough, that's tough, that's a tough one to beat. No, it's much easier, being Presidential is easy, all you have to do is act like a stiff, look.
Ladies and gentlemen of Texas, it is a great honor to be with you this evening, and the media would love it, and everybody would be out of here so fast. You wouldn't have come in the first place when you get right down to it, but Democrats will never get that chance because Texas will never give it to them.
Texas is not going to -- remember the last election, they said, these phonies in the back, they said, Texas is in play. They said you'd toss in play too and I came here, we had rallies like this, thousands of people outside, they couldn't get in. And I said, why is Texas in play? They say it -- it's phony, it's suppression, they try and get your hopes down, there suppress -- and this is just like fake news [Audience shouts "Boo"] but they said, Texas, they said, Texas is in play.
Ladies and gentlemen, Texas is in play. This is CNN, Texas is in play. President Trump -- and I had guys on from Texas and they're wearing cowboy hats [Inaudible] a lot of guys, they go I don't know about you, but I know something about Texas, and Donald Trump is not going to lose Texas. I can tell you that, and Texas is not in play.
And we had a lot of guys said -- big, tough, guys, they're on television. I don't know what you're talking about, Texas is not in play and then that great November rain. We had that great, great night and the polls closed at seven o'clock, and usually, they have to take hours, and you know sometimes at least, even if it's big they take a half an hour.
The Texas polls have closed, and you know usually if it's close, it takes hours, and if it's not even just like so close, it takes a long time. So they go ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the State of Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas, right? Right? Donald Trump. The polls have closed in Utah.
Do you remember the guy with the shaved head? He was going to be my competition, even Hillary beat him. Now he's on these talk shows knocking the hell out of me all the time. Now even Hillary beat this guy in Utah, right? Hillary came in second, I came in first by a lot, but that was another one, too close to call.
Except, ladies and gentlemen, Utah, the polls have closed, Donald Trump has won the State of Utah. They're just -- they're the same thing and we won, and we won by a lot, and we won Florida, and we won South Carolina, and we won Georgia, and we won North Carolina, and we won Pennsylvania. We won a lot. Remember these phony people?
There is no way to get to 270. He had to get to 270 so I kept going to Maine, I love Maine. But Maine too, you get one, it's cut in half, Maine too, you get one. I went there four or five times because -- they got me up, they got me up to 269, couldn't get to 270, so I went there. I won, by the way, I won Maine too.
I got one but I went there and I went there a lot. That's the beautiful thing about the electoral college, you go everywhere. You don't just spend it three -- and you know, winning the popular vote would be much easier. I'd rather have that. I'd go to four states and relax. I went to 21 states. True, true, I used to be a believer in the other but when -- I think winning -- it's like you're a track star.
You're working out for the hundred-yard dash or the mile, it's a different form of training, it's a different form but we did great. They said, he cannot get to 270, and they were right. We got to 306, true. After decades of economic surrender, I have taken historic action to confront China's rampant trading abuses and we've made great progress, and our relationship with China is fantastic, and great things are happening.
You watch, they get it now. They get it and a lot of good things are happening. We're replacing NAFTA with disastrous -- I mean, it's been to me, probably, I used to call it the worst trade deal in history. I think the World Trade has been -- WTO a real beauty, World Trade Organization, that's a real beauty.
They considered China a developing nation and because you're a developing nation, Ted, right? They considered China to be a developing nation and because they're developing, they get tremendous, and we wrote them letters, we don't consider them to be a developing nation. We don't consider India to be a developed -- because they're ripping us off and we didn't win any cases at the WTO, and now we just won $7.5 billion of countries that were taken advantage of. And we won a lot of cases lately, we didn't win anything for years practically.
Now, we've won a lot of cases. Do you know why? Because they know I'll leave if they don't treat us fairly, they know it. And then the piggy bank is gone where they all rob from. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster and we have to get this crazy Nancy Pelosi to put this thing up for a vote. We have to get her.
And the USMCA is a giant victory for Texas farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, workers and oil. The Democrats should pass it overwhelmingly. They will but Nancy has to put it up for a vote. Do-nothing Democrats, they're do-nothing, nowhere is the Democrat betrayal of our nation more dramatic than on immigration in recent debates.
Did you see these debates? Do you believe what I'm competing with? I don't know. When I had to compete with Ted Cruz that was brutal. You know he's, he was the National Debate Champion, a story I've never told. I never did that before, right, I ran for office. All of a sudden, I'm supposed to be debating tomorrow night.
I said who are these people? The hell, I don't know all of them. I know a lot of them. I contributed to a lot of them. They used to treat me very nice when I contributed to them, not so nice when I was their opponent, that changed a lot. But I said, let me see, I want to see who are these people. I'm going to a debate.
I never debated, my whole life has been a debate, but I never debated like with a podium, and this and that. So, I said who are they? And we had 17 people plus me. We had 18, it was actually not 17, it was 18, remember? Gilmore, nobody remembers him but we had 18 people. I said who are these people? Are they any good at debating?
And I hired a debate coach and he lasted for about 10 minutes. I said this guy knows less than I do. He didn't know anything. He didn't know anything, it's true. He said never ever interrupt while they're speaking, I said, OK, coach. Put me in coach. And after a couple of those statements, I mean, I mean, you can't beat Ted Cruz if you don't interrupt him, it's impossible.
But my first -- it's true. So I see, let me see the cards, let me see the whole thing. I want to see it. I need help. I'm going to be debating in front of millions of people, and everyone's saying do you think Trump's going to be able to debate professionally? I said let me see these cards and all of them.
You know, he was President of his class, one guy, one guy was a good debater in college, he was this, he was OK, but they give me the first card, Ted Cruz, and it says National Debate Champion from Princeton. Is that right? And then National Debate Champion from Harvard. I said to my wife, First Lady, potentially, I said, my potential First Lady, I got a problem.
I said some of these guys are OK, they were only President of the class, almost all of them ran for President of the class, I never did, I like playing baseball better. It's true. But I said, I said, Melania, and I called Ivanka, I called my kids. I said I got a problem, Ted Cruz was the National Debate -- he was the number one guy in college.
He was the number one guy in law school. How the hell do I beat a guy that's good at debating? But we came out OK, Ted. And Ted, Ted was tough, smart as hell and tough, tough, good man, but it is true. The first card I looked at, seriously, was Ted Cruz and he was -- he was literally, I mean, National Debate -- he was the best in all of college and in law school and he's a talented guy.
In recent debates, you see these people up there, they're, not Ted Cruz. Believe me. Hey, Ted, you should turn Democrat. You would win in that group very -- no? he says -- I don't think so. Every single Democrat candidate for President raise their hand in favor of giving free healthcare to all illegal aliens.
[Audience shouts "Boo"] They want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to American citizens, you see that. As President, I will never allow the Democrats to take away your healthcare dollars and give them to people that are in our country illegally. I can't do it. In fact, I just signed an Executive Action to protect American healthcare benefits for all American citizens.
Among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are millions of legal immigrants right here in Texas, including millions of patriotic, hardworking, Mexican-Americans who play by the rules, pay their taxes, follow our laws, and strengthen our communities. Whether you are a first-generation or tenth-generation and every American citizen -- and you do. You've been treated so badly but you're not being treated badly anymore you know.
We got rid of the individual mandate from crazy Obamacare. Every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, your borders, and is always loyal to you for a change. We're loyal to you. My administration has reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May and that's with no help from the Democrats.
They won't close up the loopholes. They won't close the loopholes and we could do it in 15 minutes. And we're building the wall and we're doing all of these things but the Democrats won't close up the loopholes. You know what the loopholes are, right? How about catch and release. You catch them, you say hello, darling, how are you?
Could you please give us your name and phone number? I don't have a phone. Could you give us your address? They don't want to have an address -- that's in Honduras. Could you please give us your address and your name? They can't. I said that's, OK. We catch and we release and they go into our country, and then, we are getting them out of the country, and you know what, some are very good people, some are unbelievably dangerous and bad people.
And we're focusing on the bad and they're getting the hell out of our country, OK? While we're fighting for shared priorities, the American people, the Democrat Party, has never been farther outside of the mainstream. They've gone nuts. Every Democrat running for President is pushing a healthcare agenda that would utterly eviscerate Medicare.
My administration will always protect Medicare for our beloved seniors and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in over 51 years. People don't talk about it. The press will not talk about it. We have news conferences.
We tell them this. They will not put it in the press. You have no idea how dishonest the media is. You have no idea. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And that crackpot Governor from Virginia executes the baby after birth.
You saw that, right? After birth, after birth. You remember that one from last year. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of crazy politicians, high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption.
They're corrupt like Schiff is corrupt. He's corrupt. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it's the party of the American dream. It's also the party of Honest Abe Lincoln. We forget that. We got to use that more often, don't you think? Honest Abe, I like honest Abe.
We've confirmed -- he says it's honest Donald, thank you. Explain that to them. You're right. We've confirmed 152 federal judges to apply the law as written, including two Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. You know when I got into office, they say the most important thing a President can do, I actually think it's defense but they say it's the appointment of federal judges.
So when I got in, always when you get in, there are none. How many did you have? I have none, none. So I got in and say, how many federal judges do I have? Sir, you have 142 two federal judges. No, you don't understand the question. That's impossible. That would mean that President Obama didn't appoint 142 judges.
You get none or you're doing a bad job as President because you're representing a different philosophy, very different. So I came, I said, no, no, no, check it again. Then they said 138, then they came back to actually, sir, the number is 142, we were right the first time, 142 judges. Within two months, we will have John and Ted and all of these great Congressmen, we will have passed 182 federal judges.
And then they say Obama wasn't he such a wonderful President? How are you a wonderful President? How are you a wonderful President when the most important thing you can do you handed over to the Republicans, 142? How is that good? I mean, how is that good? [Inaudible] If I were a Democrat, I wouldn't be too happy about that number and we'll have a record number of judges, by the time our term is over in 16 years, maybe 20. I'm only -- I'm only kidding because every time I do that they say, see, he's assuming control.
We have this crazy guy on television and he goes, you know, he's talking to a guest. He goes you know he's going to win, don't you? You know he's going to win. I mean, we've done a good job, he should be happy. But he said, our military, our schools, our this, everything, he says you know he's going to win.
And I guess because we know what we're going to fight, we're going to fight. No, no, he's going to win, and you know, he's never leaving. You know that don't you? He's never -- he's never leaving. He's never going to leave and I thought this wacko was kidding. You know he's a comedian, I thought he was kidding.
He's serious, he really believes that. [Inaudible] We passed for the veterans, VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of those great people. They've been trying to pass it from us 50 years, they couldn't get it done. But those guys right there and me, we got it done. And to protect America's security, I went through the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal.
I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and we also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America, you've seen it many times. Oh, I'm so sorry. Now, you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for your great state of Texas.
You must never forget, the 2020 election is about one thing, and it's coming up fast. It's about you. It's about you. One thing, about you. I'm doing this for you. You know, we had in 2016, I really believe it was maybe the greatest election. I guess George Washington was good, right? But that was easy, and by the way, he did even better percentage-wise in judges than I did.
He had 100%, but we could have 50%, that's not bad, and I had many more than he had. So I guess you got to give George Washington -- what do you think, Ted? You got to give him something. I'd say, honest Abe, that was a pretty good election, right? Andrew Jackson, they say our stop, Andrew Jackson, but Andrew Jackson was a good election.
But we had among the greatest elections of all time. But we have to now submit that election, we've got to submit it. And once we do, it's going to be very hard to take this beautiful experiment apart but it'll be very -- because it's all about your family, it's all about your future, and it's all about the future fate of our great country, so important.
With your help, we will lift millions of more citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. And by the way, thank you, Robert Jeffress, for being here, wherever you may be in this massive -- wherever you are Robert.
Where is he? He got up, he started saying, he may not be the greatest person. I said this is like four years ago, I see this guy, what a mouthpiece he's got, and he's a man of God, and he said, he may not be the greatest, he may not be the most perfect Christian, he may not know the Bible as well as some of us, but he is a leader, and I love Donald Trump.
I said who is that guy? I love that guy, Robert Jeffress. He's a great guy, got a big, big group of people on Sunday mornings too. I can tell you. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words, that beautiful phrase, I love it, made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine.
Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years, we're doing that. Who would have believed we could do that? We're doing that. And the previous administration spent no money on that and we're spending a lot but think of that. Who would have thought that we're going to end within 10 years, the AIDS epidemic in our country, who would have thought we've advanced?
We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that unite people all across our land, and throughout the great state of Texas. This is a great state. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. Thank you. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true bedrocks of our society. We believe in the creeds of self-reliance, personal responsibility, and American independence.
We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country and together, we are taking back this country, our country. We love our country, we're returning power to you, the American people, that's what we've done.
From Dallas to El Paso, from Houston to Austin, from the Red River to the Rio Grande, this state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth, Texas. This is the state where William Travis, James Bowie, and Davy Crockett made their last stand at the Alamo.
This is the state where a small band of patriots at the Battle of Gonzales, armed with a single cannon, stared down a foreign army and declared, come and take it. [Audience chants "USA"] And Texas is the state where generations of farmers, ranchers, pioneers, and oil workers built a life and a home with their own two beautiful hands.
They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common: they loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. These courageous Texas Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy, demolish our liberty, and destroy our proud American heritage.
We will never ever allow that to happen. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America proud again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will Make America Great Again. Thank you, Texas. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Duluth. Thank you very much. I am thrilled to be back in the great state of Minnesota -- [Applause] -- with truly some of the most incredible people anywhere on Earth. You know that. [Applause] And you know, I hate to bring this up -- [Laughter] -- but we came this close to winning the state of Minnesota. [Applause] And in two and a half years, it's going to be really easy I think. [Applause]
It's been many, many decades since a Republican did that, and I thought I was going to do it. I needed one more visit, one more speech. That's why never give up. Never, ever give up. One more speech. [Applause] No, we're very proud of Minnesota. Let me also say congratulations to the Bulldogs on winning the NCAA Championship hockey tournament.
Wow, that's a big deal. Right in this arena. This is where they play, right? Boy, I hear they're a great team. And how many are going to the NHL? How many? Two? Three? That's a lot. They're going to do it. Great team. Thank you. Great team. The Bulldogs. [Applause]
So we're honored to be joined tonight by many wonderful Republican leaders, including our incredible House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Kevin, come up please. Please come. Where is he? Kevin. [Applause] He sends a lot of money this way, I want to tell you.
I also want to thank and maybe just ask him to come up -- we have all night long, right? Do we have time? All night. [Applause] We're not going anywhere. Some great people. Congressman Sean Duffy. [Applause] Great champion. Come up, Sean. Come up. Great champion. You know, there -- you know, the whole thing going up the trees and down the trees. Number one in the world for four or five years. Come here. [Applause] With a great, great wife by the way. Very talented.
Tom Emmer -- Congressman. Loves this state. [Applause] And a very popular man in the state of Minnesota, Jason Lewis. [Applause]
I also want to thank Lieutenant Governor Michelle Fischbach for being here. She has been so great. Got a big race coming along. It's going to do great. Along with State Senator Karin Housley. Karin. Come on up here. Get them up here. [Applause] Where are you? Stay there. It's too much of a deal. Good luck, Karin. Good luck, Michelle. Thank you.
Also, a friend of mine and a man who's been incredible and a great supporter, Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka. [Applause] And Minnesota Republican Party Chair Jennifer Carnahan, who has been fantastic. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you.
And finally, the person we're all here to support tonight, somebody who's very special -- by the way, loves ice hockey -- real ice hockey family. In fact, his brother, you know, the coach of the winning women's team in the Olympics. Not bad. [Applause] Great family. The next congressman from Minnesota's 8th Congressional District, the great Pete Stauber. Come on up. [Applause]
I'll tell you, is this a pretty good sendoff for Pete? This is not bad, right? [Applause] Hey, Pete. Come here. Say a few words. He wasn't supposed to do this, but let's hear him. Right? [Laughter] Come on. Come on.
Thank you, Mr. President. Welcome to the city of Duluth and the great state of Minnesota. [Applause] And as you alluded to, the home of college hockey's National Champions, the University of Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs. [Applause]
I'm Pete Stauber, and I'm running in Minnesota's 8th Congressional District because, like President Trump, I love this country. [Applause] I love our freedoms. [Applause] And I love our Constitution. [Applause]
Mr. President, before your election, you made a promise to visit Minnesota. And you promised more jobs, fewer regulations, and a better economy for everyone. [Applause] Now, jobs are up, unemployment numbers are at a historic low, small businesses and manufacturers are surging -- [Applause] -- and optimism is at an all-time high. [Applause]
My blue-collar, commonsense conservative message is resonating throughout the 8th District. Mr. President, these people support you. [Applause] And, Mr. President, these are the same people that are going to send me to Washington so together we can unleash the economic engine in Northern Minnesota. [Applause]
On behalf of the Minnesotans here today, thank you for coming to our great state and for always putting America --
First! [Applause]
-- for always putting America and the American worker first. [Applause] Thank you. God bless America. [Applause]
So I didn't know he was going to do that, and then he takes out a speech and reads it. I said, "That's pretty good." [Laughter] He is a great guy, and he loves you, and he loves this country. And he's going to do fantastically. He's going to win. We're going to keep on winning. Remember, I used to say in a little jest, but I really meant it, "We're going to win so much." Remember? We're going to win, win, win. [Applause] It's what we're doing.
Remember? I said, your governor or your senator or Pete or somebody, they're going to come into Washington say, "Mr. President, please, we're winning too much. The people of Minnesota cannot stand winning so much. Please, can we take it easy?" And I said, "No, we're going to keep winning, winning, winning." [Applause]
So we've created 3.4 million new jobs since Election Day. 3.4. And I've said before, if I would have said that to you during the campaign, those very dishonest people back there, the fake news --
Booo --
Very dishonest. They would have said, "He's exaggerating."
CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks! [Applause]
These are very dishonest people. Many of them. And we have some people, too, doing that. But there's a lot of very dishonest people. For instance, I just got back, as you know, from Singapore, where I met -- [Applause] -- where I met Kim Jong Un. And we had a great meeting, great chemistry. We got along really well, which is very important. They didn't want us too. But, you know, it's like nice to do that.
And very interestingly, at first everybody was amazed -- amazed that we had the meeting. They couldn't believe it the first 24 hours. They said, "I can't believe it." You remember that, a while ago? They said, "They're going to meet." Then about a day later they said, "What's the big deal with the meeting? What's the big deal?" In other words, their bosses said, "You can't say that."
But the beauty was this: So we had a meeting. It was an incredible success. And they said, "The President gave away so much. He met with them." I said, "What else?" That was -- I met. What am I supposed to do? I had to meet. Right? "He met." Now, sentence one says, a total denuclearization of North Korea. That's what it says. [Applause]
We got back our hostages. [Applause] And I didn't pay $1.8 billion to get back our hostages -- paid. We got back our great fallen heroes, the remains. In fact, today already 200 have been sent back. [Applause] They stopped shooting missiles over Japan. They stopped all nuclear testing. They stopped nuclear research. They stopped rocketry. They stopped everything that you'd want them to stop. And they blew up sites where they test and do the testing. [Applause]
And it was a great meeting. And Kim Jong Un will turn down -- and I will tell -- he will turn -- Chairman Kim will turn that country into a great, successful country. And let me tell you, and let me tell you -- [Applause] -- let me tell you this: A year and a half ago, nobody thought that was possible. In fact, before I was elected, everybody assumed we were going to war. It would be a vicious war. In Seoul, you have 28 million people living 30 miles off the border. They don't even need nuclear weapons for that. They have thousands of cannons aiming right on top of Seoul. You could have lost millions and millions of people.
But I got along with Kim Jong Un. I got along. [Applause] And that's a good thing, not a bad thing. [Applause] And these people, you remember, I said, "I can't believe it. He's giving away so much." You know what I gave away? A meeting. [Laughter] [Inaudible] And the fact that we do get along means we're safe. I'm not saying things can't happen. Things go wrong. Mistakes are made. Relationships get broken. But right now you are so safe, and such a great event took place.
And all over Asia -- [Applause] -- and all over Asia they're celebrating the great achievement that we made because you were the ones that put me here. We made -- that we made all over Asia. [Applause] And really all over the world. And by the way, in our country. Everybody knows what a great achievement this is not only for us, but for North Korea, for South Korea, for Japan, for China, for everybody.
And I have to say, you know, you've been reading where I've been putting very large tariffs on China. Very, very large. [Applause] We hit the $250 billion mark. But I want to say, and we have to do that because it has to be balanced, it has to be fair. It wasn't fair. China and President Xi have really helped us a lot at the border of North Korea. Really helped us a lot, and he's a friend of mine. He's a friend of mine. [Applause]
So you should be very proud of yourselves for what took place because that was very close to war for many years. Many years, it was very, very close. And now we can have something where everybody is going to live in peace for a long period of time. And there will be denuclearization. So that's the real story. Thank you. [Applause] That's the real story.
So unemployment numbers are among the best in the history of our country. African American unemployment is at its lowest level in the history of our country. [Applause] Hispanic American unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded the history of our country. And remember I'd go into big stadiums like this that were packed?
And by the way, you're very good at real estate. Did you see the thousands and thousands of people outside? That will never be reported by the fake news. But the thousands of people that couldn't get in. [Applause] Many thousands. They're all over. The parking lots. They're all over. And it would be great if the cameras could take a shot of the arena. [Applause]
So usually they don't do it. And I usually go home and my wife would say, "How was the crowd?" Although honestly, when you have many thousands of people like we have tonight -- you know, I was at an event three weeks ago where a person from the New York Times said, "There was only a thousand people." And the people -- the many thousands that were there protested. I didn't even have to do it. And they wrote a slight correction. They were off by many thousands of people. That's the way it is. It's fake news, I'm telling you. So fake. [Applause]
But usually they don't show the arena. They just show my face. So people would say, "Did you have many people there?" Um, didn't you see? No, no. They've only showed your face. And we all have ego, but I don't want to show my face. I want to show the crowds. It's much prettier. [Applause] Because you people are incredible.
Unemployment among women has reached the lowest level, as of today, in 65 years. Sixty-five years. [Applause] And most importantly of all, America is respected again. We're respected. [Applause] We're fighting to protect American iron, aluminum, and steel, and to protect our incredible and very brave miners. [Applause]
But I'll tell you, to keep this incredible momentum, I think maybe the most successful that the country has ever had. I think we are now at the most successful level that the country has ever seen. That's how we're doing. [Applause] And let me just tell you, because I hear a couple of the fakers, the other day, said, "Well, I think it's Obama's economy." Obama's economy? Obama?
Booo --
They want to put on more regulations. They want to take back your tax cuts, which are massive. They want to take them back, and they want to raise the hell out of your taxes. And the whole thing will go "boom."
Booo --
So we need more Republicans. We got to get out there in the midterms. We got to get more Republicans. Got to get more Republicans. [Applause] A vote for a Democrat for Congress is really a vote for Nancy Pelosi and her radical agenda.
Booo --
Democrats want to raise your taxes; increase your regulations; shut down American energy; take over American healthcare, which has been a disaster with Obamacare; and ship away American jobs. And that's what they will do. If anything bad happens to this country, it will be a disaster for all of you. But we're not going to let it happen. We worked too hard to get here. [Applause]
And the greatest phrase, I think, in the history of politics is on all of those red and white hats that I see out there: "Make America Great Again." And that's exactly what we're doing. [Applause] Make America great again. And you know what our new phrase is in two and a half years. You know what it is, right? "Keep America Great." That's what it is. Because that's what we are. [Applause]
So the Democrats want open borders. Let everybody come in. Let everybody pour in. We don't care. Let them come in from the Middle East; let them come in from all over the place. We don't care. We're not going to let it happen. And by the way, today, I signed an executive order. We're going to keep families together, but the border is going to be just as tough as it's been. [Applause]
Democrats don't care about the impact of uncontrolled migration on your communities, your schools, your hospitals, your jobs, or your safety. Democrats put illegal immigrants before they put American citizens. What the hell is going on?
Booo --
Illegal immigration costs our country hundreds of billions of dollars. So imagine if we could spend that money to help bring opportunity to our inner cities and our rural communities and our roads and our highways and our schools. [Applause]
Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!
So we've already started the wall. We got $1.6 billion. The wall has been started. [Applause] San Diego and lots of different places. And we go -- but, boy, it's tough. They want to do anything they can to obstruct and to make sure it doesn't happen. But it's happening. It's happening.
Oh, we have a single protestor. There we go. Goodbye, darling. Goodbye, darling.
Booo --
So we have a single protestor. He's going home to his mom. Say hello to mommy. [Applause] And tomorrow, the fake news will say tomorrow, "Massive protests at the Trump rally." One person. Massive protests. Aye yai yai.
So we're going to make it great for Americans. And we're going to take care of people. And we do want people coming across our border, going through our ports of entry, but we want people to come in through merit. Not just through luck or happenstance. We want them to come in through merit. [Applause]
And we need people, because we have so many companies now -- and you know very well in Minnesota what's happening. They just gave me a run-through. What's happening in Minnesota is incredible. But we have so many companies moving back into our country. We need people to help, but we want them to come in through the merit system, not a system where we get MS-13 and everybody else that other countries don't want. [Applause]
And the Democrats' open border policies have also allowed MS-13 to break into our country and drugs to pour into our streets. And we're stopping it.
Booo --
We have taken out of our country -- and actually -- can you believe I have to say this -- we have liberated towns. Liberated. Like it was captured by a foreign country. We have liberated towns out in Long Island. [Applause] MS-13, gangs. We have taken them out of our country by the thousands. [Applause]
And these countries that send them back, we're putting in legislation -- we're not giving them anymore aid. When they send people up. Remember the original speech -- right? My original speech. They are sending -- you remember those words? Everyone said, "Oh, how terrible." They are sending -- well, let me tell you, they're sending -- and they're not sending their finest. That I can tell you. And we're sending them the hell back. And what we're doing -- [Applause] -- what we're doing -- we give hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to countries. We have a horrible deal, as an example, with NAFTA and Mexico. Horrible deal.
Booo --
They make over a hundred billion dollars on that horrible trade deal where factories were emptied. So many bad things have happened, and we're going to make it a part of NAFTA. Because you have to mark up thousands of miles coming through Mexico -- you come up thousands of miles coming through Mexico, and we're going to stop it.
Get him out of here. Get him out of here.
Booo --
Go home to your mom, darling. Go home. Get him out of here. Out.
Booo --
USA! USA! USA! [Applause]
Was that a man or a woman? Because he needs a haircut more than I do. It's true. [Applause] I couldn't tell. Needs a haircut.
But the media never talks about the American victims of illegal immigration. I know them well. I know so many of them. I campaigned with them. What's happened to their children, what's happened to their husbands, what's happened to their wives. The media doesn't talk about the American families permanently separated from their loved ones because Democrat policies release violent criminals into our communities. We need safety. We need safety.
They don't bring cameras to interview the angel moms whose children were killed by criminal aliens who should have never been here in the first place. Not even close. They don't want to talk to the angel moms. [Applause]
But as your President, I will always fight to protect American families. I will. [Applause] I will always fight for an immigration system that defends our borders and takes care of our sovereignty as a nation. [Applause] I will never sacrifice the safety and security of the American people. And I will never be silent in the face of vicious smears and attacks, and the heroic agents and officers of ICE and the Border Patrol who save millions. Just the job they do -- saves thousands and thousands of lives. And are so brave, and are so tough. [Applause]
If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration, then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders. [Applause] Because we need Democrat votes. We have a majority of one in the Senate. We need Democrat votes in the Senate. We need additional votes in the House. We will have the greatest borders, the greatest walls.
We've already started, but it's a lot tougher than it needs to be. We need Republicans to get out and put Republicans in. In case you don't know, in the Senate, we need, unfortunately, 60 votes. We have 51 votes. We need Democrats. They will do anything to obstruct, anything to make it as uncomfortable as possible. Because they think it's good politics. I actually think it's bad politics. We will see very soon. [Applause]
Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!
We're building it. We're building the wall. That wall is happening.
Under the previous administration, America's rich, natural resources, of which your state has a lot, were put under lock and key, including thousands of acres in Superior National Forest. You know what that is, right? Tonight, I'm proudly announcing that we will soon be taking the first steps to rescind the federal withdrawal in Superior National Forest -- [Applause] -- and restore mineral exploration for our amazing people and miners and workers, and for the people of Minnesota -- one of the great natural reserves of the world.
And we'll do it carefully. And maybe, if it doesn't pass muster, we won't do it all. But it is going to happen, I will tell you. It's going to happen. And it's happening fast. We've already taken it, as you know, a long way down the road. And it's going to make things better. It's going to make it, from an environmental standpoint, better.
As a result of our massive tax cuts, millions of Americans are receiving much bigger paychecks. Much bigger. [Applause] We've eliminated record numbers of job-killing regulations. By the way -- so, a few days ago, it was 500 days. So now it's like 511. In 500 days, we've cut more regulations than any President in the history of our country, whether it's 4 years, 8 years, or in 1 year -- in one case, 16 years. We've cut more regulations in 500 days than any President, even our 16-year President.
We've opened up energy exploration in ANWR in Alaska. [Applause] They've been trying to do that from before the days of Ronald Reagan. Couldn't get it done.
We repealed the core of Obamacare. The individual mandate is gone. So unpopular. [Applause] The individual mandate where you pay a fortune for the privilege of not paying for insurance for healthcare. Let me tell you, we just repealed it. You don't have to pay anymore. So big. So big. [Applause]
And we would have repealed and replaced Obamacare, although we've gone a long way toward doing that anyway -- we just had to do it a longer route. Because we had a gentleman, late into the morning hours, go thumbs down. That was not a good thing he did. That was not a good thing for our people, for our country, whether you're a Democrat or Republican. And everybody said, "Oh, good. We have his vote. We have everybody's vote." We were going in for a routine repeal and replace, and he went thumbs down. Not nice. That was not nice.
Booo --
We're bringing back our jobs from other countries. We're bringing back our companies from other countries. Chrysler is coming back. Chrysler just announced they're coming back. [Applause] Many, many companies are coming back to our country. They know where the action is. This is where they want to be. And as far as trade is concerned with other countries, we want fair and reciprocal trade. We don't want stupid trade like we had for so long. Stupid trade. Right? [Applause]
Remember the word "reciprocal." Remember the word "reciprocal." We have been ripped off by almost every country on Earth -- our friends and our enemies. And I hate to say it, our friends do a bigger and better job than the enemies. But those days are over. Those days are over. [Applause]
And even before we finish off with the trade deals -- and we will finish off with the trade deals. People don't realize we have the cards. Because we're the piggy bank that everybody was robbing for 30 years. We're like the piggy bank. Let's go get some more. You look at the European Union. They put up barriers so that we can't sell our farm products in. And yet they sell Mercedes and BMW and the cars come in by the millions. And we hardly tax them at all. They don't take our cars. And if they do, the tax is massive. So they're basically saying, "We're going to sell you millions of cars. By the way, you're not going to sell us any." Not going to work that way anymore, folks. Not going to work that way. [Applause]
We will not be taken advantage of anymore. We're a great country. We're going to be an even greater country. Hopefully, greater than we've ever been before. We have such potential. [Applause]
We just secured a record $700 billion in funding to rebuild our military, which was in very sad shape. [Applause] And we have approval for next year: $716 billion. We're ordering new planes. We make the best in the world. We're ordering new ships. We're ordering new military equipment. And we even gave our great warriors a raise. [Applause] Gave them a raise.
For the veterans, we passed the largest VA reforms in half a century. A landmark VA accountability law. You know what that is. You couldn't fire anybody that worked in the VA. They were sadistic in some cases, they were lazy, they were this, they were that. Lots of different things. You could never fire anybody because the accountability, you could forget it.
So we passed a bill that they've been trying to pass for almost 40 years. It's called VA Accountability, where now you bring the person into the office and you say, "Jim, I'm sorry to tell you you're fired. Get out of here. Boom." [Applause] Right?
And even more important -- and I didn't think I'd be saying this so soon because I would campaign on this -- I used to go out during the campaigns -- and you know it because I was in Minnesota a lot. But obviously, one more trip. Aye yai yai. That won't happen again. [Applause]
But one that's really important to me. And I used to say to myself, "I wonder why doctors don't just take care of our great vets." We just passed Veterans Choice legislation. Passed; signed. [Applause] That gives our veterans the care they deserve, the care they earned. Now look, so our veterans were waiting online for 9 days, for 12 days, for 3 weeks. Someone online with a minor problem, they ended up having a terminal disease.
Now, I said during the campaign, before I knew too much about it, but there's a lot of common sense in life. I say, instead of one of our great veterans waiting for two, three, four, five weeks, why don't we let them go see a doctor and pay the bill? And that's what we're doing. That's Veterans Choice. That's Veterans Choice. [Applause]
And you know, I went to people -- I thought about it -- I thought, oh, I think I'm such a genius. Okay. I thought this was the -- like, the greatest idea. But I went to the vet groups, I went to every -- "Yeah, we've been trying to get that passed, sir, for 30 years." Okay? I didn't know that. But what I did know is I knew how to get it passed, and we got it passed. Two weeks ago. [Applause]
And by the way, we passed another one. It's called "Right to Try." You know what Right to Try is? Very proud of it. Right to Try. These are people that are terminally ill. It's sad. They travel all over the world if they have the money. If they don't, they don't know what to do. If we have drugs that haven't been approved yet but are showing tremendous promise, it didn't matter.
It didn't matter how sick you were, where you were. You couldn't get it. And the reason was, they didn't want to do anything that's going to hurt you. You're not going to be around for five weeks. In five weeks -- I kept saying, "Why can't we do something?" If people had the money, they'd travel to Africa, to Asia, to Europe trying to find the cure.
It was called "hope." They wanted hope. And they couldn't get it. I said it's ridiculous. I got involved. And this is also -- like Veterans Choice, for many years people have tried pass it. And Kevin was a great help. I have to tell you. Kevin McCarthy, who just left the stage, was a great help. So were your congressmen. A great help. [Applause]
And we got Right to Try passed. And four weeks ago, I signed final legislation, and we're very proud. [Applause] And many people are going to be saved. Many, many people are going to be saved. And you'd think it would be easy, but it wasn't. Between the insurance companies and the healthcare companies and the pharmaceutical companies -- it was incredible. But we did that, and now we're bringing down the prices for prescription drugs way down. [Applause]
So we've made this incredible progress together with your help, with the help of the millions and millions of people that -- well, some polls got it right. But not all polls got it right. But they showed up, and the beginning of that night, people are saying, "You know, this could be a big problem for the Democrats."
They were not liking what they were seeing. They were seeing too many of those hats. They were seeing too many people with -- you know that. That was an amazing evening. That was one of the most incredible evenings. Because that's a movement, the likes of which this country has never seen before. This country has never seen it. [Applause]
You know, we talk about the forgotten men and women. They're the smartest people. They work the hardest. They pay taxes. They do all of the things. And yet, they were the forgotten people. And believe me, our people are the smartest and the hardest working. Smarter than anybody, and the hardest working. [Applause]
You know, a little thing I was talking about today. You ever notice they always call the other side -- and they do this on -- "the elite." The elite. Why are they elite? I have a much better apartment than they do. [Applause] I'm smarter than they are. I'm richer than they are. [Applause] I became President and they didn't. [Applause] And I'm representing the greatest, smartest, most loyal, best people on Earth -- the deplorables. Remember that? The deplorables. [Applause]
USA! USA! USA!
You know, I was watching when Crooked Hillary made -- and by the way -- [Laughter] -- hey, excuse me. Have you been seeing --
Booo --
Have you been watching what's been going on with the Inspector General's report? What a scam this whole thing is? Okay?
Booo --
How guilty is she?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!
With Peter Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page.
Booo --
I don't think their wife and husband are too happy about that. What do you think? What do you think? I don't think so.
No, but have you been seeing this whole scam? Have you been -- do you believe what you're seeing? No matter what she did, no matter how many crimes she committed, which were numerous, they wanted her to be innocent. With me, nothing. No collusion, no nothing. And they just wanted to take all of us. They wanted to put us in trouble. And it's not working too well, I'll tell you. Disgusting. [Applause] Called the "phony witch hunt." Phony witch hunt.
But you look at the corruption. Did you ever see anything like it? Really, today more things -- that's why they're building up immigration so you can't see what's going on in Congress. They're building up immigration. They don't want to show what's happening in Congress where this whole scam has been revealed. So they want to stay on immigration where Obama had bigger problems than anybody, where Bush had problems, where other -- they want to stay on immigration because they don't want to go into the halls of Congress, which has totally revealed the Russian scam that's going on. [Applause] What a group. What a group.
I'll tell you something, we want to get along with Russia. But Russia is looking out and they're saying, "Man, I wish she won." Between our military, our oil that we're doing. She wanted to have windmills. You know? We want to compete with the oil. All the things we've done. All the things we've done, including sanctions. So many things. They're looking back, they're saying, "You know, I wish Crooked Hillary won that election. It would have been a lot better for Russia."
So what we want to do is we want to elect more Republicans so that we can deliver on all of the things I'm talking about. And I'll be honest with you, we're going to deliver it anyway. We're going to be able to deliver it anyway. [Applause]
We're going to lift millions of Americans from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. We are going to lift them. [Applause] You know, one of the greatest things about all the jobs we've created -- to me, the greatest -- is that people now don't get stuck in one job and they hate it.
They don't want to get up in the morning. They have many, many options. They can go out. Wages are rising. It's a beautiful thing taking place. They can get something -- I've always said, you know, when I make speeches on how to be successful -- I always say, like the first thing, you got to love it. You got to love it. You got to love your job or you're never going to be good.
These people now that didn't have any options -- they were hanging on to one job that they hated. They have many, many choices. They get the job they want. And for the first time in 20 years, wages are rising. [Applause] We're going to build new airports, and we're going to build railways and highways and waterways all across this magnificent land. We have spent, because of horrible decision-making, $7 trillion in the Middle East. Think of it. Seven trillion.
Booo --
And if we want to fix a window, it's like a big deal. Seven trillion dollars. It's all coming back. Remember during the debates, I'd talk about growth. Growth. We need growth. Nobody has ever seen growth like we're having right now. When I go around and meet foreign leaders, they all congratulate me. "Mr. President, congratulations on the growth of the United States. Congratulations." Every one of them. First thing they say. First thing they say. [Applause]
USA! USA! USA!
By the way, is there anything more fun than a Trump rally? Is there? Seriously. [Applause] And we break every attendance record every single time, just about. [Applause]
We're going to put new steel into the backbone of our country, and we're going to make that steel right here in the United States. [Applause] We're going to breathe new hope into our communities. And our workers are already so proud again. We will do it all with American hands and American heart and American pride. And everything we do, we will stand up for our citizens. We will fight for our country. We'll stand up for America. And we're going to stand up for the great state of Minnesota. And you're seeing that. [Applause]
Your great state was pioneered by men and women who braved the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their incredible families. They were really tough, and they were really smart and strong. [Applause] They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury. But they had grit and they had faith and they had courage and they had each other. Right? [Applause]
They were miners, and ministers, and fishermen, and farmers, and shipbuilders, and shopkeepers. But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. [Applause]
Together, we're renewing the miracle of the great American Midwest. Do you remember not so long ago, we were producing those cars and we producing all of this stuff? And since then, so many companies went to Mexico and went to other places. As I said before, they are coming back, and they're coming back faster than anybody could ever believe. [Applause]
We're standing on the shoulders of great American patriots who put down the railroads, built up the highways, and dug out the most amazing Panama Canal, losing thousands of lives in doing it. They crossed the oceans, trekked the deserts, scaled the mountains, created the most incredible republic the world has ever seen. And you know what? Our republic today is prouder and greater than it ever was before. [Applause]
Our beautiful ancestors won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put a man on the face of the moon. [Applause] And I think you saw the other day, we're reopening NASA. We're going to be going to space. [Applause]
Space Force! Space Force! Space Force!
Space Force. Space Force. So we have the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard. But we have the Air Force. Now we're going to have the Space Force because it's a whole -- we need it. [Applause] We need it.
As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never, ever fail. There is no place like our place. There is no place. [Applause]
With your help and with your voice and with your vote, the Republicans will win and keep on winning. We will keep on winning. We have great people. [Applause] And Pete is a great guy. You got to get him a victory. Great guy. Got to get Pete a victory. You got to get him a victory. We need him.
We will achieve victory for our magnificent country and our magnificent land -- the land that we love. Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. [Applause]
We will never give in, we will never give up, and we will never, ever stop fighting for our country or for our flag or for our freedom. [Applause]
We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. [Applause]
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Minnesota. Thank you, Minnesota. [Applause]
Thank you very much, El Paso. Thank you very much. Thank you. I am very, very thrilled to be here in the great State of Texas -- right on the banks of the legendary Rio Grande, where by the -- well, I don't know, you heard, right? Today we started a big, beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande. Right smack on the Rio Grande.
I love this state and I love the people of this state. We've had a great romance together. You know, that. It's been a great romance and we're only getting stronger together. That's what's happening. Wow, look at all the press back. You believe that? [Audience Boos] This is like the Academy Awards used to be, used to be. They've gone down a long way since they started hitting us a little bit, right?
They've gone down. That was a long -- that was a long fall, but there they are. Last week I was honored to stand in the House Chamber to deliver the State of the Union -- and I asked both parties to come together to choose greatness for America. Since taking office two years ago our economy is now the hottest economy anywhere on Earth.
Our military, which desperately needed funding, we went $700 billion and $716 billion, is More powerful than ever before. That was not a good situation. It was tired and depleted. Our great warriors were not taken care of. Now they're taken care of again the way they should be. And America is winning again.
Isn't that nice? We're fighting for all Americans, from all backgrounds of every age, race, religion, birthplace, color, creed. We're fighting for ourselves. We're fighting for all Americans. And what is it, America first? Remember, it's America first. [Audience chants USA] Our agenda is not a partisan agenda, although some people say it is. [Audience member calls out We love you] Every once in a while it does become that way.
Right? It's a mainstream, common sense agenda of the American people. It's where we want to be and where we want to go. And despite the fact that the media refuses to acknowledge what we've done and how well we're doing it -- [Audience Boos] -- a new poll just came out as I was coming on and it shows -- I don't know how you can do this, I don't think I've had a good story in years. [Audience laughs]
I don't get good -- I used to get great press until I decided to run for office. And we have done together, an incredible job. And a new poll just came out today Rasmussen, one of the most respected polls, one of the polls that got the election right, so I have to remember that, you know what the number is, 52 percent, with no good news.
Explain that. Explain that. Explain that. How do you get that when you don't get good press? I guess 93 percent of the stories are negative. No matter what we do, they figure out a way to make it bad. [Audience Boos] Like, I'll give you a quick example. When I came in, North Korea was -- it looks like it was going to war.
You know that. It was going to happen, bad things. Now you have no missile launches. You have no rocket testing. You have no nuclear testing. I have a good relationship, maybe even a great relationship. We have tremendous sanctions on North Korea. But we have our hostages back. We have -- remains are coming back.
Remains. And our presidents have been dealing with North Korea for many, many decades, many, many decades. And on a nuclear way over the last 20, 30 years and all I hear is, "Can't you move faster?" You know what? I left Singapore 15 months ago, they've been negotiating for 85 years or something. So now their complaint is, "What's taking him so long?" I heard one of our great geniuses from a previous administration telling me how to negotiate with North Korea when they got taken advantage of like nobody I've ever seen before. [Audience Boos]
So some day, with all of us, this is all of us -- and those hats are beautiful, by the way -- Someday -- True. Someday they're going to appreciate us all. And I'm going to Vietnam, to Hanoi, in the near future, 27th and 28th of February, to have another summit and hope we -- hopefully we do as well with the second summit as we did with the first.
I hope so. Now, we're delighted and I'm delighted to be joined this evening by the Texas leaders. You have great leaders, great people, great help to me -- that are at the forefront of this incredible American Revolution. You know, there's never been anything like this in the history of our country. We have to understand.
There's never been. If you would say, as an example, that tonight, 69,000 people signed up to be here. Now, the arena holes 8,000, and thank you fire department, they got in about 10, thank you fire department, appreciate it. But if you want to really see something go outside, tens of thousands of people are watching screens outside.
Tens of thousands. And we were all challenged by a young man who lost an election to Ted Cruz. [Audience Boos] And then they said, "You know what? Hey, you're supposed to win in order to run. By the way, we, I, we, I'm one and one, I'm one for one. Think of it. We had one election, we won, now we're going to be 2 for 0 and everything's going to be perfect.
But a young man who's got very little going for himself, except he's got a great first name, he has -- he challenged us. So we have, let's say, 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people, not too good. In fact, what I do, what I would do is I would say, "that may be the end of his presidential bid," but he did challenge us. So I want to introduce some great people.
Your Governor, Greg Abbott. Greg. Where is he? Where's Greg? Thank you Greg. And a great governor and a great friend of mine. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. Thanks Dan. Thank you Dan. Look at him in the corner, so shy. Thank you Dan. Great job, Dan. Attorney General Ken Paxton. Thanks, Ken. And Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller.
Thank you, Sid. Thank you, everybody. Thanks, Ken. Great job you do. And we're especially grateful to your wonderful Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Great Senators. [Audience Chants USA] And we have a lot of your Congress men and women. We have a lot of them. Are you already? And they're terrific. And they've been with us all the way.
Pete Olson. Pete. Thanks, Pete. Thank you, Pete. Michael Burgess. Thanks Michael. John Carter. Brian Babin. And Randy Weber. Thank you very much. We are in the midst of an economic miracle. That's what's happened. You look all over the world and you study and you see what's going on. You can look at China.
We have a team right now in China, they want to make a deal very badly. Those tariffs are costing them a lot of money and they're going into our Treasury, remember that, we're filling up with billions of dollars. And did you see the, you know, I haven't been here very long, the trade deficit really went down very big this last month, and people are saying, "Whoa." I told you so. That's what I do. That's what I do. And we don't want China to have a hard time.
Thank you. Thank you. I -- I can only tell you this, we're going to make great deals on trade. We're going to make great deals on military. When we defend another nation that's rich they have to help us out. Do we agree? They have to help us out. And they're doing it. They're doing it. You saw South Korea, they were paying us $500 million a year.
I say you got to do more. You got to give more. Anyway. Now they're up to almost $900 million, that was like a do phone calls. I said -- I said, "Why didn't they do this before?" They said, "Nobody ever asked. Nobody asked." You pick up almost $500 million a year, nobody asked. We're defending rich countries, they've got to help us out, folks.
They've got help us out, sorry. And you know what? They're going like us more and maybe more importantly, they going to respect us. Since the election, we have created 5.3 million new jobs, including more than a half a million new manufacturing jobs. Remember, manufacturing was dead? They said manufacturing was dead, the previous administration.
You'll never have it. You need the magic wand. That's what they said. We obviously, we found the magic wand. And by the way, those numbers is small compared to what's happening, compared to all of the companies that are moving in. The unemployment -- [Audience Boos, chants USA] Thank you very much. Thank you.
The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans have reached the lowest level in the history of our country. [Audience chants Trump] Okay, thank you. Thank you. Are you all right? Everything okay? Please. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And women have filled almost 60 percent of the new jobs created last year, which were a record number.
We passed massive tax cuts for working families and we canceled a record number of job killing regulations. That's why your oil and gas is coming back. We eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate. And to give critically ill patients access to life saving treatments, we did something that they haven't been able to do for a long time, we passed Right To Try.
Right To Try. That's an incredible thing, Right To Try. You know, we have the greatest doctors and research in the world, and if somebody was terminally ill they traveled to Asia, they traveled to Europe, they'd travel all over the world, if they had the money. If they didn't have the money, they'd just go home, there was nothing they could do. And I said, "Wait a minute.
We have drugs in the pipeline that are showing tremendous progress. If somebody is terminally ill let's let them have access to our drugs. Let's let them have access." And it's much tougher than you would think. But we got it and people, you will not understand, nobody understands, the lifesaving effects, it's incredible what's going on. They are getting better.
People are getting better that were thinking they were going to die. It's right to try, I love it. I always wondered why we didn't do it before? Now, the people in Texas won't care much about this, but the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on Earth. I didn't think you'd care about that.
I didn't think Texas would care about that. And listen to this, and Texas oil production is now at the highest level it's ever been. And only for the great oil professionals in the room, we're getting those pipelines approved so fast you'll be able to practically double up on oil production, oil and gas.
They're getting approved at record levels and record time, that means more money, more security, and more independence for our country -- it's very simple. Another one they said could never get passed, they've been trying to do it for 40 years, we passed VA Choice, Veterans Choice. So that now, rather than waiting online for five days, for nine days, for three weeks -- [Audience Boos, Chants USA] Where do these people come from?
Where do they come from? They go back home to Mommy. They get punished when they get home. [Audience chants Build that wall] Now, you really mean finish that Wall, because we've built a lot it, steady and slowly. But before we get to the Wall, so VA Accountability and VA Choice. Accountability, we couldn't fire anybody from the Veterans Administration.
We couldn't fire anybody. They could treat our veterans badly. We had to take it. Now, you get rid of them. And VA Choice, they'd wait online for days and weeks, they couldn't see a doctor. Now, they go out, they have a choice. They get a private doctor. They have things taken care of and we pay their bill.
They've been trying to get those two things fixed for many, many decades, many years and we got it fixed. We also passed the Farm bill for wonderful farmers, ranchers, and growers. Just got it. We just got it passed and that was it easy but we got it passed. We had to do it. Our farmers are great. So we just get that done, farmers, ranchers, growers.
And we passed historic legislation to combat the Opioid Crisis. [Audience chants Trump] Thank you. [Audience Boos, Audience chants hey, hey, hey, goodbye, as an audience member is removed from the coliseum] Thank you. Is there any place that's more fun to be that a Trump rally, is there any place? You know, they all said, "Mr. President, we loved the tone of your State of the Union speech." Some people said it was a great speech.
Some people said, "Really a great speech." I said, "But if I ever did that in El Paso, Texas, it wouldn't work here too well," do you agree? Nice and calm. No, that's not what you're looking for. This is more fun. This is more fun. And we just signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law. Nobody thought that was going to be happening.
In my address last week, I asked lawmakers in both parties to cross the aisle and join together for the common good for all Americans. Democrats have to stop being so angry. They're angry. And they've got to start being partners to keep this -- really, look, is just an incredible miracle that's going on? We want to keep it going.
Keep it going, and it will keep going. It will keep going. There's so much to celebrate in our country, the economy, the military, so many things we've done scientifically. The world is trying to copy what we've done, they're not going to be able to do it. Not anymore. They were catching up fast, now they're going in the wrong direction.
Wrong direction. Unfortunately, many of the Democrats in Congress responded to my call for bipartisan cooperation by instead choosing really -- hey, look, did you ever see anything -- radical resistance, it's the radical left. But maybe it'll change. [Audience Boos] Maybe it'll change. It all has to do with 2020 and the election.
But I really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of "Let's hop a train to California." [Audience Boos] Of you're not allowed to own cows anymore. You know, a lot of problems. A lot of problems. But nobody's ever had this. And by the way with us, we handle it. No president should ever have to go through what we've gone through in the first two years.
It's a hoax. It's a disgrace, and it should never be allowed to happen again. A hoax. Just recently, as an example, Senator Richard Burr, from the great State of North Carolina. He's chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and they've been investigating this Russia hoax for two years. [Audience Boos] Think of it. They've interviewed over 200 people.
They've studied hundreds of thousands of documents and pages and Richard just announced that they found no collusion between Donald Trump and Russia collusion. The fact is, that the real collusion was between Hillary and the Democrats and the other side with Russia, that's where the collusion is. That's where the collusion is. [Audience chants Lock her up] That's starting to make a lot more sense.
But that's where the collusion is, with the Democrats, and with Russia, and with others. And by the way, there's also collusion between the Democrats and the fake news right here. [Audience Boos] And they know it better than anybody. Too many Democrats are focused on tearing down their opposition instead of building up our country.
They're trying to impose some of the most extreme measures and policies ever put forward by our Congress. And by the way, I don't think anybody in this room wants to pay 70, 80, 90 and 95 percent tax. Does anybody want to pay a 90 percent tax? [Audience Boos] You know, you look at what we've done with jobs, what we've done with the economy, how low your taxes are, the lowest they've been almost from the beginning, who the hell wants to change what we're doing now?
We are a hot, hot country. Last week they introduced a massive government takeover that would destroy our incredible economic gains. They introduced the so-called Green New Deal. [Audience Boos] It sounds like a high school term paper that got a low mark. [Audience laughs] It would shut down American energy, which I don't think the people in Texas are going to be happy with that. [Audience Boos]
It would shut down a little thing called air travel. [Audience Boos] How do you take a train to Europe? [Audience laughs] You know, this -- this crazy senator from Hawaii, they said, "Do you like it?" "Yes, I like it very much." Oh, really, how are we getting to Hawaii on a train? [Audience laughs] She didn't think about that one but she's thinking about it. She'll figure it out.
They want to take away your car, reduce the value of your home, and put millions of Americans out of work, spend $100 trillion, which by the way, there's no such thing as $100 trillion, you have to spend $100 trillion -- And remember this, no other country except us is going to do it. That's a little problem, too.
While the world's real polluters, like China, would get many of our companies and factories, they'd just move into China, move into other parts of the world. That's the way the system works. It's not going to happen folks. Don't worry, it's not going to happen. Not going to happen. $100 trillion. Let's spend $100 trillion.
Let's rip down every building in New York City and rebuild it environmentally slightly better. To pave the way for socialism, Democrats are calling for massive tax hikes and the complete elimination of private health care. Many of us have private health care. That means you can stand on line for five days as you wait for a doctor that is not nearly as talented as your doctor.
Remember? "You can keep your doctor." Remember that? 28 times, "You can keep it." That didn't happen. It turned out to be alive. Hey, where are the fact checkers? You know, some of the most dishonest people in media are the so-called fact checkers. 28 times, "You can keep your doctor." That didn't turn out to be what he said.
They're coming for your money and they're coming for your freedom and it'll never happen and it won't even come close, folks. Democrats are also pushing extreme late-term abortion. [Audience Boos] Allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. What's that all about?
So in Virginia, the governor, he's got a little publicity lately. [Audience laughs] I like it. It keeps us out of the papers. I like it. I'd like to find a few more guys like this one. He almost moon walked. His wife stopped him, "Darling, that would be inappropriate." I want to see somebody trying to imitate Michael Jackson in the moonwalk.
This would not have been a good scene. His wife saved him, darling, this would be inappropriate." I think she was right. But the governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world and wrap the baby and make the baby comfortable. And then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby.
Execute the baby. [Audience Boos] Incredible. Millions of innocent, beautiful babies are counting on us to protect them and we will. That is why last week I go I called on Congress, with your great congressman over there -- thank you, fellas -- to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late-term abortion.
And that certainly is extreme. Many people never even heard of it. I mean, have you ever even hear of anything like this? [Audience calls out No] Democrats must also address the double standard on full display in Virginia. By the way, that state's going to go Republican pretty soon, I'm pretty sure -- because the Democrat Party has never been more outside of the mainstream.
They're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders, and crime. [Audience Boos] This weekend, some Democrats even proposed a measure that would force the release of thousands of criminal illegal aliens -- [Audience Boos] -- including dangerous felons convicted of rape, sex trafficking, violent assault, and even murder, into our country.
Can you believe this? [Audience Boos] Their proposal would put a hard cap on the number of illegal aliens that are brave ICE officers, we love our ICE officers -- can detain and thus remove, forcing thousands of criminals to be set free into United States communities. I don't think so. Okay. I don't think so. And I want to thank our ICE offices.
What they put up is incredible and that includes Border Patrol and that includes law enforcement. Let's face it. Law enforcement, we love them. They keep us safe. In the last two years alone, ICE officers have made 200, listen to these numbers, 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 40,000, 40,000 larcenies 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 12,000 vehicle thefts, 11,000 robberies, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 murders. [Audience Boos]
-- murders, murders, killings, murders. [Audience chants Build that wall] We will. We will. If we cut detention space, we are cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country. Slashing ICE tension is the first step of many for the far left, I call them the radical left We will never abolish ICE.
They want to abolish ICE. We're never going to abolish ICE. So let me say very clearly to those pushing this ridiculous and radical agenda, I will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of violent criminals into our country. And I will never abolish or in any way mistreat our great heroes from ICE, and Border Patrol, and law enforcement, never.
We will always stand with those brave men and women. We will always be with them. We're going to take care of them just like they take care of us, remember that. Now, I have to tell you, as I was walking up to the stage they said that progress is being made with this committee. Just so you know, we're building the Wall anyway.
They say that progress has been made, interesting. Just now. Just now. I said, "Wait a minute. I got to take care of my people from Texas. I got to go. I don't even want to hear about it." I don't want to hear it. So I don't know what they mean "progress is being made significant". Now, what did happen is the Democrats were being hit really hard on the concept of releasing criminals into our society, that has not been playing well.
So maybe progress is being made, maybe not. But I had a choice, I could have stayed out there and listened or I could have come out to the people of El Paso in Texas. I chose you. I chose you. So -- so we probably have some good news. But who knows? Who knows? We'll -- we're -- we're setting the stage folks.
You know what it's called, right? It's called with setting the stage. We're setting the table. We're doing whatever we have to do the walls being built, it'll continue. It's going at a rapid pace. The Rio Grande, it's happening, go check it out. We proudly welcome those who come lawfully, and support our values in the United States, and that want to strengthen our society and help us with all of the companies moving into the United States, moving back, they left us now they're moving back, many of them, in some cases, maybe all of them, but they all want to come back because the United States is where the action is, very simple. [Audience chants USA]
It's where the action is. And it is -- we're most proud of the fact, you look at the car companies, they're moving back. They're going into Michigan. They're going into Pennsylvania. They're going back to Ohio. So many companies are coming back. And by the way, that's why I want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit.
Through merit, so they can help us build our country. Make America Great Again, pretty soon we're going to be saying, Keep America Great, Keep America Great. Pretty soon. Pretty soon, congressman, Keep America Great. We'll have to switch over. Tell me, tell me, the campaign's sort of started because you have these people that nobody ever heard of, they're all running for office.
I said, "Who is that?" "Well, that person was a mayor of a city that was defeated." Well, how about Beto, Beto was defeated to, right? [Audience Boos] But he suffered a great defeat. Watch what the news does tomorrow, though, they won't mention the disparity. They won't mention the disparity tomorrow. They'll say, "Beto O'Rourke," That's his last name, right, O'Rourke?
Beta O'Rourke had a wonderful rally of about 15 people. [Audience laughs] No, when they get honest, when the media starts becoming honest, and maybe they will, because we've done something that's never been done before, we have suffered a totally dishonest media and we've won and it's driving them crazy.
It's driving them crazy. It's driving them crazy but look at them, they still come. I've never said anything like it. But illegal immigration hurts all Americans, including millions of legal immigrants, by driving down wages, draining public resources, and claiming countless innocent lives. You see what's going on, folks.
You know what's going on. They give you all of these phony stats they say, "Oh, it's the same. It's the same." It's not the same. It's a bad situation going on and we've stopped it. We are taking out thousands and thousands of people from MS-13, we're bringing them to hell out of our country, thousands. But if we had proper border security, including a very powerful wall, we wouldn't have to work so hard and it would be a lot safer and a lot better.
My Administration is committed to ending illegal immigration, while modernizing our legal immigration system, which has been in terrible shape for many, many decades to prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves for them actually and contribute to our economy, people that come in on merit, merit, merit -- instead of random lotteries and chain migration.
Chain migration, that's another beauty. [Audience Boos] We want a merit based system for entry, this will improve living conditions for all Americans living here today, both immigrant and U.S. born, everybody's going to be happy. And we need the people to take care of these companies that are moving. Our unemployment rate, real unemployment, 3.6, 3.7 -- and going down, had a little blip because of a thing called the shutdown.
But remember, it went up to 4.0. I said, "Boy, that's -- " Do you know how low 4.0 is? Do you know anybody else, any other president that would have said, "Please give me 4.0, please?" [Audience laughs] We had a little blip, it went up from 3.7 to 4.0, just quickly. But you know what? If we didn't do that shutdown we would not have been able to show this country these politicians, the world, what the hell is happening with the border.
That was a very important thing we did. And the fact is, illegal immigration is a heartbreaking human tragedy. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the very long and dangerous journey north up to our country. Sex traffickers, these are the worst human beings on Earth, exploit our porous border to sell young girls and women into modern day slavery.
You wouldn't even know that, nobody knows that. And by the way, do you think they come in through the ports of entry? [Audience calls out No] I listen to the Democrats, let me nice, just say the Democrats, I won't be specific, and they say, "Oh, everything comes through the port." They don't do that. They drive out where there's no barrier, no wall, they make a left.
Congratulations, you're in the United States. That's all. If you have three women tied up in the backseat of a car, you're not going through, folks, a port of entry where they do look in the backseat, at least, right? Drugs pouring through the border kills tens of thousands of innocent Americans a year, including heroin, meth, cocaine, fentanyl, and so many others.
They come through the Southern border. We have a drug problem over the last 6, 7, 10 years like we have never had before. We can have such a big cut in the numbers, in the percentages, if we get the Wall built -- if we have a strong Wall with other things, but we need the Wall and it has to be built and we want to build it fast.
The number of illegal immigrants crossing our borders is so large that we've know where to hold them. We have to build -- they want buildings, they want jails. They want, these people, how about the word caravan? [Audience Boos] Caravan, I think that was one of mine, but it looked like a caravan. Where you have thousands and thousands of people coming from Guatemala, from Honduras, and El Salvador, and they march up through Mexico.
And by the way, if we didn't have walls in those areas, in some cases that we put up, in many cases where we reinforced, in many cases where our great military helped us with barbed wire -- you would have people pouring in. They don't pour in. The problem is our laws are so bad that there's no way we can quickly remove them.
Other countries say, "Get out of here." We have to bring them through a court system. We sign their names, they touch our land, we sign them up, we explained to them, "Please come back in six years for court," and only the dumbest people show back up. Nobody ever shows up. Nobody comes back in, like 2 percent.
They go in to our country. The good news is we have great law enforcement and many of these people, we know where they are, and we're going to get them the hell out. But we have to change our laws. So right now we have a backlog. You won't even believe this. Other countries don't do this. Somebody walks into our country, we bring them to court, we have now a legal -- we need Perry Mason -- [Audience laughs] -- we have a legal case.
Nobody else does that. Other countries say, "Get out. You can't come in. You're not a citizen of whatever country." We bring them in. So listen to this, right now we have almost 900,000 cases, 900,000. How many judges are going to take care of -- we're going to have to hire tens of thousands of judges to do that, 900,000 cases.
How stupid is this? This was a system put in place by really dumb people or people that did not have the best interests of our country at heart. And there's no place better to talk about border security, whether they like it or not, because I've been hearing a lot of things," Oh, the Wall didn't make that much of a difference." You know where it made a big difference?
Right here in El Paso. And I've been watching where they've been trying to say, "Oh, the Wall didn't make that much -- " Well you take a look at what they did with their past crimes and how they made them from very serious to a much lesser, you take a look at what the real system is. I spoke to people that have been here a long time they said, "When that wall went up, it's a whole different ball game." Is that a correct statement?
A whole different ball game. I'll give you another example. And I don't care whether a mayor is a Republican or a Democrat, they're full of crap when they say it has it made a big difference. I heard the same thing from the fake news. They said, "Oh, crime actually stayed the same." It didn't say the same, it went way down and look at what they did to their past crimes and look at how they recorded those past crimes, it went way, way down.
These people, you know, you'd think did want to get to the bottom of a problem and solve a problem, not try and pull the wool over everybody's eyes. So for those few people that are out there on television saying, "Oh, it didn't make too much of a difference," it made a -- people from El Paso, am I right?
It's fake news. It's fake. I'm telling you, just fake news. And you know what? You wouldn't even have to know you can say that automatically without even knowing it. It's obvious, it's common sense. Just a few thousand feet, as an example, from where we stand right now on the other side of the border, it's one of the most dangerous cities in the world, Juarez, Mexico.
Well, the people at Juarez agree. Yet, thanks to a powerful border wall and El Paso, Texas it's one of America's safest cities now. Now, listen to the this, so you're talking a few feet away, right, a few feet, got a wall, a few feet away. Last year Juarez had 1,200 murders, El Paso, right next door, a few feet away, had 23 murders.
That's not good either. But 23 compared to 1,200. Walls work, actually there's nothing like them for what we're talking about. We want to stop drugs. We want to stop traffickers. We want to stop criminals from coming in, walls save lives. Walls save tremendous numbers of lives. The biggest proponents of open borders are rich liberals and wealthy donors.
These are hypocrites who oppose security for you while living their entire lives -- I do it too, to be honest with you, I'm guilty. I'm guilty. I also live behind walls, okay. They live behind walls and gates in their guards all over the place. Me too, because I want to be safe and I want to make America safe, if you don't mind. [Audience chants USA]
So security should not belong only to the rich and to the powerful, safety is the birthright of every American, which is why we must finish the Wall. It's happening. Because walls are not immoral, as it was said, human trafficking is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Drug peddling is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes]
Child smuggling is immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Sanctuary Cities that get Americans killed, they're immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] Open borders are dangerous and immoral. [Audience calls out Yes] My administration has put forward a compromise that really is a compromise, and I hate even compromise on things like this, but it's showing common sense, it's compassionate, and it's going to solve our problem and the cost is a fraction.
When you look at the drugs that are pouring across from Mexico, if it stopped a small percentage, and it won't, it'll stop a large percentage, it would pay for itself in a matter of weeks. That's the kind of numbers you're talking about, a matter of weeks. And by the way, I -- I hate to say this, because we have a very good relationship, but Mexico had the highest number of killings that they've ever had, almost 40,000 people were murdered in Mexico.
Mexico is not too far away, and we need to take care of our people and we're going to do that and it's happening and it's happening a lot faster than anybody thought. And I love that sign. Thank you. What we're proposing includes humanitarian assistance, drug detection at our ports and everywhere else, closing legal loopholes, which is a big problem, and plans for a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier or wall, let's call it a wall, it's better.
This wall will be built in the areas identified by border agents is having the greatest need while safely directing people and commerce to our many lawful ports of entry, which we're beefing up in every way, structurally, with beefing up the ports of entry and mechanically. We have equipment now that can spot drugs.
It's incredible stuff. It's expensive. It's incredible. By the way, there is nothing better than a good old-fashioned German Shepherd. It's hard to believe, right. It's true you know, I -- I was with the people and they're showing me this incredible computerized stuff and where it goes. I said "Could I -- "Because Secret Service took me out to the place and they were showing me these German Shepherds, they're unbelievable.
They'll run past all these empty boxes and one of the boxes has drugs in it, deep down in a box and they come to a screeching halt barking at it every time. So I asked the people that sell the machinery, at a lot of money, so I said, "Let me ask you a question. This stuff is incredible. I'm really impressed.
How does it compare to a German Shepherd?" The guy looks at and says, "Sir, honestly, it's not as good." Can you believe it? A German Shepard. Certain types of dogs, pretty good. You do love your dogs, don't you? I wouldn't mind having one, honestly, but I don't have any time, I don't have -- How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn, would that be -- Right, sort of not for -- I don't know, it doesn't -- I don't feel good.
It feels a little phony-phony to me. A lot of people say, "Oh, you should get a dog." "Why?" "It's good politically." I said, "Look, that's not the relationship I have with my people. We want -- " [Audience members yells something about Obama] Yeah, Obama had a dog, you're right. [Laughter] Both parties should come together to finally create a safe and lawful system of immigration.
The American people have waited long enough. We must secure the border, pass Kate's Law -- end Catch and Release, shutdown Sanctuary Cities -- you know, we need Democrat votes to do that -- deport criminal aliens, and keep the coyotes and traffickers and drug dealers the hell out of our country, please. And the Democrats also need to confirm the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are sitting in the Senate waiting for confirmation, people that have given up their lives to work in the Trump administration and the Democrats aren't approving them.
It's a record. [Audience Boos] It's total obstruction. It's a record of the history of our country there has never been -- Some people left the job a year and a half ago, two years ago, to become an ambassador or to work at one of our many great agencies and we can't get Schumer and his friends to approve them.
It's total obstruction. There's never been anything like it. Very, very unfair, very unfair to these people. In many cases, seriously, they've left jobs and they're waiting and waiting and waiting, they're slow walking every single one of them. It's a disgrace. As we fight to protect our borders we must also protect our newfound prosperity.
My administration has taken the toughest ever action to crack down on years of China's abuse and its trade practices have been very unfair. And I have a lot of respect for President Xi, but he's representing China and I'm representing the United States. We're also replacing one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever done, although I happen to think that the WTO is not so good either, we're replacing NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that everybody is loving.
We've got to get Congress to approve it. We've got to get Congress to approve. We'll get it, I think done. I mean, there's such obstruction in Congress, you know, they won't even do things that are good for our country now. They would rather have Trump have a loss than get something that's so good for our country.
Our farmers are happy, everybody's happy. And it's going to be jobs. You know, what it does? It stops companies from moving out. It makes it very hard economically for companies to say, "Hey, thanks a lot. We're firing everybody, we're moving to Mexico." Makes it very, very hard. You know, that's been a bone of contention for me for many years.
I've seen 25 percent and more of our automobile business move to Mexico and it's not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore. Unless they want to pay nice big fat tariffs to send their cars back into this country We've achieved, and by the way, tariffs had have had an incredible effect. Just ask the folks in China, "How are we doing with tariffs?" You ask.
And you ask, "How are we doing in our negotiations?" The fact is, and I say it openly, either they treat us fairly or they have to pay for the privilege of coming in and taking our wealth and taking our jobs, it's very simple. It's very, very simple. And if you look back at our country when we were very rich, when we had no debt, when we had no problems economically, you take back -- you take a look, 1888, the Great Tariff Debate, you know the debate was about?
Our country had so much money they had to debate what the hell to do with all the money because tariffs were bringing in a fortune into the United States. So at a minimum, countries in negotiating with us very seriously because of the fact that they don't want to have to pay to come in and take advantage of our country, that's at a minimum.
Check it out, 188. Have the press check it out. They'll say, "Donald Trump said 1888." [Audience Laughs] We've achieved the largest decline in drug prices in 46 years, prescription drugs. And I'm asking Congress to work with me to make prescription drugs affordable for every American family. We just got the largest decrease in drug prices, think of that, and it's not easy, it's not easy.
Because we have middlemen that take care of a lot of people for a lot of years, these middlemen and the drug companies, but even worse, the middleman, and we're cutting the middleman out. they're not going to like be very much. They made a lot of money. But think of that, they're better the first time in 46 years.
And now we're going to phase three, we did one statutorily, we did two statutorily, now we go to phase three, we're getting your drug prices down. We're embarking on bald initiatives to defeat AIDS. Who knew that? We have medicines now that work wonders on AIDS. We're looking to be AIDS-free in not many years as a country and maybe help, also, the world, the world.
So we want to defeat AIDS and we want to feed childhood cancer. We've made tremendous strides. Tremendous strides. In the Middle East, are brave warriors have liberated virtually 100 percent of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Now, you don't hear that from these people. Now, we've taken back -- soon it'll be announced soon, maybe over the next week, maybe less, but it'll be announced very soon -- we'll have 100 percent.
When I took over this country, it was a mess. And if I wouldn't have been elected -- You know, I have so many people, I was just walking up and every time it happens, "Sir, thank you. Thank you very much." This guy, he's -- he's like a monster. No, no, it's true. These people. This guy is like a monster.
He's like this monster football -- a big, strong guy. He says to me, he said, "Thank you very much." I don't know what they're saying, but that's okay. Now he's this big, strong guy and he's crying. And he said, "Mr. -- " I'm walking up and it happens all the time. "Thank you very much, Mr. President." I said, "For what?" He said, "You've saved our country.
Our country was going in the wrong direction. You've saved our country. Thank you." I've had so many people say that. So many people. You know what the truth is though? I didn't save our country, we're now heading in the right direction. It's very tough because we have so many things were fighting, including these people.
But so many people that we're finding, so many people that are either foolish or ill-intentioned. But you know, I didn't save our county, you know saved our country, you saved our country. You saved our country, and God. Because there's never -- nothing like this has ever happened before. And you know what?
The world is watching and when prime ministers, and when presidents, and kings and queens, they talked to me they say, "Congratulations on what's happened with your economy, Mr. President, it's incredible." They're emulating what we're doing. They can't believe it. So we continue to decimate the remnants, because they're always going to be remnants, we can take the area the land, we'll soon have 100 percent, but they're always remnants, they get out, they wrap themselves in bombs.
They're crazy. They're lunatics. But you're always going to have that. But we want to bring, now -- we've got 100 percent. It was so bad when I took over, it was going the opposite direction. Syria, we want to bring our troops back home. It's time. It's time. It's time. And thanks to the extraordinary service of our military in Afghanistan, 19 years we're in Afghanistan, we may now be able to seek a political resolution that, frankly, they've wanted to talk about for a long time.
We've hit them very hard, but it's been 19 years. Think of that, 19 years. We spend more on military in Afghanistan, $50 billion a year, than most countries spend on their entire country, healthcare, education, everything. We spend more than they do. It's time to start thinking smart for our country. What we want to build our country.
We want to spend money in our country. We want to build our roads, and highways, and bridges, and dams. And last month the United States recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and condemned the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime. [Audience Boos] Everywhere socialism has been, everywhere it's been implemented, it's produced poverty, misery, repression, and despair.
You take a look no matter where. Yet, there are those trying to implement socialism right here in the United States. So I, again, say to you -- [Audience Boos] -- and I say it for the world to hear, America will never be a Socialist country, never, never. [Audience chants USA] We're born free. We will live free and we will die free.
We will always be free. Each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values. We believe in the American Constitution and our great rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American way.
We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our incredible history, and always respect our great American flag. We believe that the first duty of government is to be loyal to its citizens.
And we live by the words of our national motto that we are going to keep -- we'll never change this -- In God We Trust. These are the beliefs, traditions, and principles that bind us together as citizens, as neighbors, as great patriots. These are the values that unite people all across the great State of Texas.
From Houston to Austin, from Dallas to El Paso -- from the Red River to the Rio Grande, the Lone Star State embodies the spirit of independence like maybe no other place anywhere in the world. And you have always embraced the cause of American Freedom like no one else. This is the state where William Travis, James Bowie, and Davy Crockett made their last stand at the Alamo.
This is the state where a small band of patriots at the Battle of Gonzalez, armed with a single cannon, stared down a foreign, powerful army and declared, "Come and take it." Come on, come on, take it. Texas is the state where generations of farmers, ranchers, oil workers, and pioneers help build up the most extraordinary nation in all of human history.
That's what we are. We were losing track, we didn't lose track getting more, we're just great on that track. Now, just like generations of Texas patriots who came before, you are going to make your stand. That's what we've done, we've made our stand and we've made it together. This is a big group of millions and millions of people that have come together like never before in our history.
This has never happened before. And we've come for safety, for sovereignty, and for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America. And together, with the proud and incredible and great people of the State of Texas, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Texas. Thank you.
So, I want to thank your former governor and your current vice president. And he and Karen are doing an unbelievable job for our nation. Thank you, Mike. [Applause] You're making Indiana proud and we are all making America proud. We are rocking. We are rocking. [Applause] So, I'm thrilled to be here tonight with the incredible, hardworking patriots of the Hoosier state. Hoosier. [Applause]
And I don't know if you see what's going on outside, but you have a lot of people outside that want to get in but they're not getting in because this place is packed. This place is packed. [Applause] This is truly an exciting time for our country. Jobs are booming -- remember? I told you.
I told you. [Applause] Confidence is soaring and optimism is at the top of every chart. This is a great time for our country. A lot of things happening. Every day we are unlocking new opportunities for prosperity and for peace.
All of these changes are happening because America is being respected again. [Applause, Audience chants USA]
At 2 a.m., early this morning... [Applause] And by the way, I got back to the White House at 4:30 a.m. and somebody said, Oh, that's OK. You can cancel Indiana tonight. [Audience Boos] And I said, You just don't know the people of Indiana.
I don't have the courage to cancel. [Applause] But at 2 o'clock in the morning I had the incredible honor of greeting three brave Americans who had been held in North Korea. And we welcomed them back home the proper way. [Applause] And on June 12th, in Singapore, I'll be meeting with Kim Jong-un to pursue a future of peace and security for the world -- for the whole world. [Applause] And the relationship is good. But you remember everybody in the fake news where they were saying, He's going to get us into a nuclear war.
He's going to get us into a nuclear war? [Audience Boos] And you know what gets you into nuclear wars? And you know what gets you into other wars? Weakness. Weakness. [Applause] So the relationship is good. And hopefully, I mean, for all of us, for the world, hopefully, something very good is going to happen.
And they understand it's very important for them. It's important for everybody. So Japan, South Korea, China, everybody, I think it's going to be a very big success. But my attitude is and if it isn't, it isn't, OK? If it isn't.
It isn't. But -- and you have to have that, because you don't know. We're not going to be talked into an Iran deal where the negotiator, John Kerry, refused to leave the table. [Audience Boos] What a deal. What a deal.
But here at home, the great news keeps rolling in: 3.3 million new jobs since election. [Applause] Now if during the election -- and by the way, how great is Coach Bobby Knight? [Applause] Oh, we love our coach. Remember he came in. He called me before I was running. I didn't know. They said, Bobby Knight's on the phone. I said, What does he want with me? I never announced.
I was thinking but I guess he read -- and he said, Mr. Trump I hope you're going to run. I said, Check and see whether or not this is Coach Knight. But actually when I heard that voice I knew it was Coach Knight. You can't duplicate that. And I took his number.
I said, Coach, I'm thinking about it. He said, You're going to -- you're going to win if you -- if you run -- and does he know about winning? And if you run, you're going to win. So anyway I put his number down and I was coming to this area. By that time we had a big lead but they said, Indiana. And a friend of mine said, If you could get Coach Knight, that would be a great thing. I said, You know, he called me like a year ago. Let me see if I can find his number. And on my left I had a pile of papers like this high, and I said, Let me see. I lifted up thousands of pages of junk; some actually pretty important. And I lifted it up and there's this little thing, Bobby Knight's cell phone number. Isn't that great? [Applause] And I go [Inaudible], and he picks up the phone and he said, I've been waiting for you to call. Can you believe that? And he came here and we sold out, I don't know what the hell that arena was but it was a big one.
And they went crazy. And Lou Holtz and Coach Cady... [Applause] Coach Cady, Lou Holtz, we had them all. Coach -- by the way not from this area but he's one of the greats of all time, Coach Belichick right? Great guy.
We got to love him. Oh, now we love him. We love him. He knows how to win also. But we had a lot of coaches; they like us.
They understand winning and they like us. And that's what we've been doing. And if we would have told you during the campaign that we would create 3.3 million jobs in the short time, everybody back there, the fake news media -- look at all of them. [Audience Boos] They're fake news. Everybody back there would have said, Can you imagine he's saying we're going to create 3.3 million? Can you believe it? We would have been -- but you know what? We understand.
We understand. And -- and today -- today in the history of our country, just came out. Right? We have the most jobs available in the history of our country. Just came out. [Applause]
I like that. [Applause] We like that. We like that a lot. Because we have a truly great country and I've been promising those kind of numbers.
The unemployment rate is at the lowest level since the turn of the century. [Applause] African-American unemployment has reached the lowest level in the history of our country. [Applause] Remember I used to read stats, Hispanic, African-American stats. And I'd read -- and it said, high crime rate, lousy education, this, this, I'd read like six.
And one day in front of a massive crowd, 25,000 to 30,000 people, I said, Vote for me. What the hell do you have to lose? And you know what? They did. They did. [Applause] And my people all said, Oh, that was not nice. I said, It's true. Because the Democrats -- who are just obstructionists. That's all they can do. [Audience Boos]
The Democrats have had a lock on the Hispanic vote and they've had a lock on the African-American vote. No longer. No longer. [Applause] So the Hispanic unemployment likewise is the lowest -- think of it, in the history -- in the history of our country. It's the lowest. So you have African-Americans, Hispanic, women, women, women. We love women. Women. [Applause]
The lowest unemployment rate in 18 years. I'm sorry we didn't make it in history but we're catching -- it will soon happen. I'm disappointed with that. Can you imagine? My most disappointing stat is women.
It's the lowest unemployment rate in 18 years because all of the others are history. But I have the feeling the women will soon be history too, because that's what's happening. [Applause] And all of the great momentum that we're having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military, it's all at stake in November. You know, I don't think we've ever done better as a country, certainly the economy and lots of other things.
Look at all of those beautiful red hats. Those beautiful red hats. Look at them. [Applause] Boy oh boy. And I like the white ones too.
Make America great again. Lifts those whites up there. But it can disappear quickly. You know, what we did was unprecedented in the history of our country, really in the history of the world, what we did with this election.
And the strides that we're making have never, ever been made like this before. But it can also disappear if you put fools and if you put the wrong people in. It can disappear. I mean, Nancy Pelosi said yesterday... [Audience Boos] Nancy Pelosi said yesterday she wants to end the tax cuts and raise your taxes. I said, tell me. Is that like good politics? You know, it's not about politics but think of that from a political standpoint. I don't think her party was too happy. But you know what, that's her thought.
That's what they want to do. They want to raise your taxes, end your tax cuts. They want to have open borders where everyone flies into our country. That's not happening. [Audience Boos]
So this week you nominated an incredible slate of Republican candidates, many of whom I know. [Applause] And you have to work every day between now and November to elect more Republicans so that we continue making America great again. [Applause] And by the way, this is a first for Indiana. Our new slogan for 2020, you know what it is? Keep America Great. [Applause] Keep America Great. [Applause] Because we're doing so well that in another two years when we start to heavy campaign, Make America Great Again wouldn't work out too well, right? It's going to be Keep America Great because that's exactly where we're headed. [Applause]
But don't tell anybody. I don't want anybody to know. We want to save that for a surprise. But I do like that.
And you know what I paid for that slogan. You know, a lot of these people, the politicians they run. They pay millions of dollars for ideas like that. How much did I pay for that? Zippo.
Zippo. [Applause] And I have great respect for the process. But in all fairness, Obama -- President Obama... [Audience Boos] ... paid $1.8 billion for hostages.
Not me. You -- last night you saw it. And again, it's leading to some very big things. And I think that Kim Jong-un -- Kim Jong-un did a great service to himself, to his country by doing this.
But those hostages came out with respect, we didn't pay for them. We're going to set the table. We're going to make a great deal for the world, for North Korea, for South Korea, for Japan, for China. [Applause] So what he did was the right thing. But they came out for nothing and the others came out for $1.8 billion in cash.
Can you believe that? We're honored to be joined by a friend of mine and somebody who's done a really, really good job. Somebody that's respected very, very highly, Senator Todd Young. Todd. Where's Todd? [Applause] [Inaudible] see? That's a great politician.
He doesn't even want a good location. He is of the people. Thank you Todd. We also welcome the largest vote winner in Indiana history, except for Trump, Attorney General Curtis Hill. Where's Curtis? [Applause] Good man.
He's done a great job. A woman who has been of tremendous help on the tax cuts, on getting rid of regulation, which maybe is just as important. Right, Jackie? What do you think? Jackie Walorski. Jackie. [Applause]
Done a great job. And some congressmen who have been incredible: Larry Bucshon. Where's Larry? Great job. Congressman Jim Banks.
By the way, somebody that just fought an incredible campaign. A really good guy, and I'm not sure I would have been here. You know, we're talking two days ago. Very effective, a terrific man, Congressman Todd Rokita. [Applause]
Thank you, Todd. Great job too. He fought tough. They all fought tough.
That was a tough race. But we have somebody here that won that race but we'll talk about him in a second. Let me also congratulate two of our new Republican nominees for Congress. First a proud Army veteran, who earned two Purple Hearts, Jim Baird.
Jim's going to really do well. Jim. [Applause] Great job. And second, a man that I know Mike has been rooting for, for a long time, I'll tell you.
Mike loves his brother, who won by a very big margin. I don't know: Was that a bigger margin than Mike Pence won by? I don't know, Mike. That was a big margin. Greg Pence.
Greg. [Applause] Finally a big congratulations for Indiana's new Republican nominee for the United States Senate, Mike Braun. That was a good race. [Applause] Get up here, Mike. [Applause] How about we let Mike for a second interrupt my speech? Is that OK? Come on, Mike.
One of the neatest experiences of my life was spending 30 minutes riding with the president. And you wouldn't believe the advice you get and it's great advice. And I'm going to incorporate it. Yes. [Applause]
You know, when I started this journey almost a year ago, I traveled the state, spent a lot of time in the north. And wanted to make sure this was going to end up with a good result. Would not have done it if I wasn't inspired by what this man did in 2016. [Applause]
He -- he cleared the field systematically and really that was the inspiration for doing it. And I can guarantee you, when I get there, I'm doing it for the right reasons. I'm a businessman and an outsider, just like our president... [Applause] ... and you can count on me to be a true reinforcement and the guy that is going to retire Joe Donnelly. Thank you. [Applause]
Thank you, Mike. And we need Mike Braun in the Senate and that's going to happen. That's going to happen. He's an incredible guy and ran a really incredible race. Now if Joe Donnelly -- Sleeping Joe and the Democrats get back into power remember what I said: They will raise your taxes -- he wants to raise your taxes -- they will destroy your jobs and they are going to knock the hell out of your borders.
And that's already -- we have the worst immigration laws in the history of mankind. We're slowly getting them changed. We want to make it quick. So give me some reinforcements please. OK? [Applause] Last week, as an example, the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, Congressman Keith Ellison -- you know him? [Audience Boos] ... marched in a parade wearing a t-shirt that read -- he's very proud of it -- I do not believe in borders. [Audience Boos] But I have a lot of respect for Keith Ellison.
You know why? Does everyone know why? So when I announced on June 16th, he was being interviewed by George Stephanopoulos on ABC. [Audience Boos] And in the interview -- this was a couple of days after I announced. And Keith Ellison said, You know he's going to win, don't you? Right, Mike? It's true. He said, You know he's going to win. And George and somebody else there I won't mention the name. Go ahead. They smiled a little bit, respectfully.
But Keith Ellison, he said, He's going to win, and essentially he was sort of indicating and there's nothing you're going to be able to do, and that's what we did. So, in one sense I have to respect him. He said, He's going to win. So you can never dislike a guy like that, can we? But they've got a big problem. A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for those borders, and we have to do something stronger. We are going to build the wall. We are already starting the wall. [Applause] We're going to build the wall. You know, we've already started.
We got $1.6 billion. We're fixing a lot of it. We're -- in San Diego, so here's what -- here's a case study. San Diego wants the wall.
And I said to my people, Here's the bad news. If we give them the wall, we don't have an advocate. If we don't give them the wall they're going to be putting a lot of pressure on Governor Moonbeam in California, right? But you know what I did? Something I would normally not do, which means in life I'm getting nicer as I get older. I said, Let's build the wall for San Diego. So we're building them the wall. I shouldn't have done it. [Applause] Actually I, sort of, changed my mind after we started. I called my people, I said, How much would it cost to stop building the wall in San Diego so they go out and advocate for us because they're desperate for their wall. Because they don't like people running over their front yards and all of the problems, including by the way massive amounts of crime? I said, How much would it cost to stop -- I'm in the construction business it's what I do best.
They got back to me they said, Sir, it will cost approximately $7 million to stop. Now, that's not big numbers when you hear about the numbers we talk about, $7 million to stop and restart it at a later date. I said, I can't do that to the American people. Keep building the wall. Right? [Applause] So we're building the wall but we're -- we're getting it all done. We're going to get rid of catch and release. We're going to get rid of -- we're going to get rid of the lottery system. We're going to go eventually -- when I get the votes. I need Republicans. We're going to go eventually to a merit-based system of immigration. Merit.
You come in on merit. [Applause] Your senator, Joe Donnelly, voted against enhanced vetting. Think of that. What -- what in the world would anybody be doing voting against enhanced vetting? Why? And he opposed a measure to block illegal immigrants from getting welfare.
And now you have places where they want to give college tuition to illegal immigrants and your own kids can't get it. Your own kids can't get it. [Audience Boos] Joe Donnelly voted no on tax cuts, no on better health care and he voted no on canceling job-killing regulations which maybe even more important than those incredible tax cuts. But he voted yes on something that we are systematically taking down.
We got rid of the individual mandate. We have great plans coming out. He voted yes for failed Obamacare. And we're doing everything to keep those premiums down but it's a failed experiment, Obamacare.
But wait until you see the plans we have coming out literally over the next four weeks. We have great health care plans coming out. But we got rid of the individual mandate. [Applause] Joe Donnelly will do whatever Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi tell him what to do. They don't ask -- they don't ask him.
They tell him. They don't say, Will you? They say, Joe, this is the way you're going to vote. Mike Braun will be a great, great representative of the people of Indiana. Mike Braun is a winner. Great businessman, by the way.
Very successful businessman. Mike Braun will fight for the values that bind us all together as Americans. We support law and order and we support the heroes in law enforcement. They're great. [Applause]
They're great. And they will tell you surplus military equipment, right? We have it by the hundreds of millions of dollars sitting in warehouses getting old. Some of the best stuff anywhere in the world and past administrations said, No, we can't give that to law enforcement. Someday somebody's going to explain why, but I sort of get it. But it's not a good reason.
It's about a 1 percent reason. We have a 99 percent. That equipment is being transferred all over the United States to our police and our law enforcement professionals. [Applause] And we already have it. The other side said, But it's too good.
It's too good. It's already paid for. We defend the 2nd Amendment. And don't kid yourself, it is under siege. [Applause] We defend the right to self-defense. Never believe that your 2nd Amendment is not under siege.
We believe that a strong nation must have strong borders. We have pride in our history and respect for our great American flag. [Applause, Audience chants USA]
And we put our large, beautiful hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, right? [Applause] And we proudly stand -- all the time we stand because we love that sound. We stand for our national anthem at all times. [Applause] But if we're going to defend our values, we need people in Washington who share our values. Democrats like Sleeping Joe say one thing when they're in Elkhart and then they go to Washington and vote for the radical, liberal agenda.
It never, ever fails. [Audience Boos] You know, there's about 12 of them. You think you have their vote and they talk a good game but they always raise their hand for the radical left of Nancy Pelosi. Always.
The Center for Effective Lawmaking named Joe Donnelly the least effective Democrat lawmaker in the United States Senate. I don't know, Mike, but I think that will be a very good phrase to run by. He's never sponsored a bill that has become a law. This November, Indiana will face an important choice: You can send a really incredible swamp person back to the Senate like Joe Donnelly or you can send us Republicans like Mike Braun to drain the swamp. [Applause, audience chants Drain the Swamp]
Under my administration, we're fighting against the lobbyists, the special interests and the corrupt Washington politics. After years of rebuilding foreign countries, of which a lot of people partake in the cost of rebuilding those foreign countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. [Applause] We fight to build their borders, but we don't fight and spend no money to build our borders. Figure that one out.
We're fighting and we're finally putting America first. [Applause] And remember the last time I did this and this started two and a half years ago when I just started. People were not saying Merry Christmas anymore. The big store chains weren't saying Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. They weren't doing it.
They weren't saying Merry Christmas. Now they're saying Merry Christmas again. [Applause] To bring back our jobs we're cracking down on unfair trade. We want trade deals that are fair and, by the way, reciprocal. [Applause] And we love our farmers. We're taking care of our farmers. And we love our factory workers.
We love our workers. [Applause] For decades American presidents responded to foreign cheating on trade -- cheating. There's no other word for it, cheating -- they responded with silence. They didn't do anything.
They were silent. Silencio. Let's not rock the boat. Oh, that's fine. We have $100 billion trade deficit with Mexico. Think of it: $100 billion trade deficit a year with Mexico.
We have a trade deficit with almost every country in the world. We're changing that around rapidly. [Applause] We racked up trillions of dollars in trade deficits, also known as losses, while other countries stole our factories, stole our plants, stole our wealth and stole our jobs. But America's long silence is over and you see what's happening.
Car companies are coming back into the United States. They're moving back in. Chrysler just announced. Japan is building big ones.
We're expanding our plants. And I put tariffs on steel and I put tariffs on aluminum and United States steel just announced that they're expanding their factories, and they're building plants and we're going to start making steel and aluminum again. [Applause] America is respected again. Different ballgame.
Under my administration, we kept another important promise when we put a great new justice on the United States Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch. [Applause] And next week, after the promises of many administrations and presidents and they never did it -- they campaigned, they promised, they never did it -- next week we will finally open the American Embassy in Jerusalem. [Applause] And I put one of my friends as the ambassador to Israel, David Friedman. Good choice is right.
One of the great lawyers of our country. Made a lot of money as a lawyer. But he loves his job. He loves the United States but he loves Israel. And they walked up to my desk about three months ago, right after I did it.
Because they said, Let's go. We want to go. We want to build. We want to build fast. So they walked up to my desk and they give me this beautiful folder and I'm supposed to sign it. I said, What is this? And I'm half signed. They said, Sir, we're building an embassy in Jerusalem sir. I said, How much? Something other president's don't ask, but that's OK.
They said -- I kid you not, they said, Sir, $1 billion. I said, $1 billion. You know, what $1 billion is? You have a beautiful house it costs you about $50,000 right? The bill. Hopefully it's worth a lot more than that. But that's what it cost. So I said, $1 billion? Yes, sir. We're looking for a site now. We're going to spend a lot of money on the site. Everyone's going to get rich from the embassy. So I called David -- I stopped signing by the way.
I had Donald. D-O-N-A-L-D and then it was like dead. Call. And then I don't know if they still have it, beautiful paper very official looking.
And then all of a sudden I stopped, never got to the T and I started putting Xs because I was afraid that somebody could say it was my signature. And I call up our ambassador and I say, David, this is crazy. I said we're going to build our embassy in Jerusalem but they want $1 billion. They're going to look for sites.
Don't we have a site? He said, Yes. We have the best site. We already own it. And we have a building on the site.
And I can take that building that's on the site, Mr. President, and I can take a corner of that building, a big beautiful corner and for $150,000 I can fix it. It will be so beautiful. The location's better.
It's set back, which is good for safety. [Applause] And I can build it for $150,000. Think of it. [Applause] Think of it. [Applause] I said, David, so you're going to renovate a corner of a building that's going to be -- he said it's going to be beautiful. The site is the best site and we own it.
The building is already built and we can fix it. So think of it: We have government wanting to build $1 billion in a site that would never be as good or as safe. This is a big site, big setbacks. They want setbacks for safety; makes sense.
So I said, David, you can do that from $1 billion to $150,000. You know what? Spend $200,000 or $300,000 that's OK too. Now think of it. And the reason I was very cognizant because I was supposed to cut the ribbon of the embassy in London. You know all that story.
So we have the best piece of property of all of London. It's our embassy. And someone between the Bush administration and the Obama administration -- Obama -- they say Bush started it but Obama could have stopped it. But let's say the two administrations what they did is they said, Wow.
This is a great piece of property. We've been offered a lot of money, like $200 million or $250 million. And what we'll do -- because we're such great businessman, what we're going to do is we're going to sell this best piece of property in London by far. By the way, literally it's the -- if you know New York, 5th Avenue and 57th Street. I happen to have a building there so you know -- but that is the best one. The Tiffany location.
It's the Tiffany location. It's the best location, and it's a big location, and it's the best embassy location we have in the whole portfolio. But somebody said, What a great deal. We're going to sell that for, I think, $250 million. So let's say -- to a wealthy person and they're going to rip it down. They're going to build a hotel or do something. And we sold this thing for $250 million.
Now everybody in this room, because you're from Indiana, you understand life. You would say, OK, good. Now you're going to build a new one for $50 million. You're going to have $200 million left over.
You're going to have a nice embassy. You're going -- that's -- OK but it didn't work that way in government. So they sold the embassy for like around $250 million. They then went out and bought a terrible piece of land in a lousy location.
And they just opened a new embassy in a bad location for $1.2 billion. What a great deal. What a great deal. So, three months ago I was supposed to go over to cut the ribbon on the new embassy, but I couldn't do it. I'm not doing it. I won't do it. Does that make sense? I'm not going to do it.
So I didn't. [Applause] Think of that story. Isn't that a sad story? So much, I could give you 50 of those stories. It's all the same. It's all the same. I could give you so many, but just remember when you see that embassy -- oh here's the other thing with the embassy. The new embassy, I said, When is it going to be open? They said, Anywhere from five to 10 years. So I said, Unless they give me an extension for the presidency... [Applause] Which I don't think the fake news media would be too happy about. [Audience Boos] Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait. Actually they would be happy. Because when I'm not here, their ratings are going to sink.
So they'll probably be very happy. [Applause] So they said, From five to 10 years. Now you know when they say, From five to 10 years that means probably 15 or 20 years, right? So we open the embassy next week. Three months. Three months. [Applause]
Oh, I could tell you so many of those stories but I won't. I won't tell you any more. We have to save some. We only have about a thousand left. Among the many grave national security blunders of the previous administration, one of the world's worst was the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, a deal that would allow Iran to go right to the brink of nuclear weapons and ultimately very quickly have a nuclear weapon.
And by the way, other countries in the Middle East who do have money all of a sudden would be looking all over the place for nuclear weapons. That was going to force a disaster. The deal also gave the regime billions of dollars. How about this? $150 billion and $1.8 billion in green -- $1.8 billion in cash, which would be used to spread bedlam and death and destruction all over the Middle East.
They're all over the Middle East. And with all of that being said, who knows, because we're putting the harshest, strongest, most stringent sanctions on Iran. [Applause] And I hope to be able to make a deal with them: a good deal, a fair deal, a good deal for them, better for them, better for them. But we cannot allow them to have nuclear weapons.
We must be able to go to a site and check that site. We have to be able to go into their military bases to see whether or not they're cheating. Now, of course, we're all sure they're not cheating, but just in case. The Iran deal was one of the most embarrassing agreements the United States has ever entered into.
You remember the 10 sailors who were humiliated in front of the world for no reason whatsoever. But once again, Democrat Joe Donnelly served his liberal handlers in Washington, not the great people of Indiana that I know so well. He voted to save the deal four times. [Audience Boos] But we save the deal no longer. [Applause] As we discuss another critical element of our national security to me, probably one of the reasons we're all here in this great victory celebration, is border security. We have many things to do, but we have already begun the construction of the wall and so many other things are following. We will have those borders extremely strong, extremely powerful, and we will have laws that match the border. [Applause] So if you think about it, the Democrats, they're weak on borders, weak on our military. We have -- and the last deal, we had to do it. Our military was depleted.
When did we need military more than we need great military right now? We got $700 billion to rebuild our military. It will be stronger than ever before. [Applause] So the Democrats, they fight against the borders. They fight to raise your taxes.
They want to raise your taxes. They fight for all of the things that we don't stand for. And we're going to have a great victory in '18. You watch.
We're going to have a great victory. [Applause] History shows that when you win the presidency, two years later the party, for whatever reason -- like 90 percent of the time, the party that wins the presidency lose it out -- it loses on the mid-terms. And the reason is, I guess they get a little bit complacent. We're not getting complacent. We can't. [Applause] If we elect more Republicans we can truly deliver for all of our citizens. We're going to keep the promises anyway, whether we do or whether we don't. I'm going to keep that. We have delivered -- and it was said by one of these gentlemen. We have delivered -- one of the only times ever -- more than we promised. I have delivered more than I promised, if you think about it. [Applause] We will lift millions of Americans from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. We will put new steel into the spine of our country. And by the way, it will now be American-made steel. [Applause]
And we will breathe new hope into our communities. We will do it all with American hands, American grit and American pride. Loyal citizens like you help to build this country, and together we are taking back our great and beautiful country, returning power to everyday American people -- these are the greatest of all people. [Applause] In every action, with every decision, we will stand up for America and we will stand up for the great state of Indiana. [Applause] This is the state where generations of American patriots and pioneers plowed the fields, carved the wilderness and worked the factories of the great American Midwest. No place like it. [Applause] It's the state that gave us Notre Dame football, Hoosier basketball... [Applause] ... and the legendary Indy 500.
With your help this November, Indiana will inspire our country again. No dream is beyond our reach. Our ancestors braved the oceans, they tamed the frontiers, put down the railroads -- those beautiful railroads -- built up the highways and dug out the great Panama Canal. We are the nation that won two world wars. [Applause] And we are the nation that defeated communism and fascists, and landed a man on the face of the Moon. [Applause] And always remember: We have picked up in wealth trillions and trillions of dollars for our country since our election -- not my election, our election. [Applause] And our economy -- people forget -- our economy -- our economy is almost twice the size of any other economy of any other nation in the world. Remember that.
People forget. [Applause] People forget. People forget. We're not going to let them forget. As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never ever fail. With your help, your voice and with your vote we will win. [Applause]
We will achieve victory for our country, victory for our children, and victory for this magnificent land that we all love, because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. [Applause] We will never give in. We will never, ever give up. And we will never stop fighting for our country, our freedom and our flag. [Applause]
We are one people. We are one family. And we are one nation under God. [Applause] And together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Indiana. We love you. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. [Applause]
Thank you very much. And hello, Nevada. Hello, Nevada. I'm thrilled to be right here in Elko with you, thousands and thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots. Patriots. In just 17 days, the people of Nevada are going to re-elect Senator Dean Heller to protect your jobs, defend your borders, and to continue making America great again.
That's what we're doing. Early voting starts today, so you got to get out. This is truly an amazing time for our country. The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in more than 50 years. More Americans are working today than at any time in our history. Think of that. More people are working in our country today than at any point in the history of our country.
That's not bad. How do you lose an election with that stat, right? That's a tough one. That's a tough one. Here in Nevada, personal incomes have reached an all-time high. Congratulations. Spend your money well. America now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Think of that. We're the number-one economy with the world.
We're the hottest economy in the world. It's amazing. Amazing. Pretty amazing, right? A couple of years ago, we were looked upon as being laggards. They're laggards! I read that word with one of the fake news folks, they wrote the word, we're laggards. Do you notice the good location they got? They're so close.
And look at all those people standing behind, they can't see. I'd rather have it the other way around, frankly. We're taking care of our veterans and our military will soon be more powerful than it ever has been ever, ever, ever before. And under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, and America is winning, because we are finally putting America first.
Just last week, we achieved another historic victory for the American people. In a beautiful ceremony -- thank you, sir. You know what I say? But he's just not my type. [Laughter] Thank you. We had a beautiful ceremony in the White House where we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
He now sits alongside Justice Neil Gorsuch to defend your rights, your Constitution, and your God-given freedom. What the radical Democrats did to Justice Kavanaugh and his beautiful family is a national disgrace. It is. The Democrat Party has become an angry, ruthless, unhinged mob determined to get power by any means necessary.
Your vote in this election will decide which party controls Congress. The choice for every American could not be more clear. And, by the way, I have to thank Dean Heller for helping us with Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. Dean Heller was there. Dean Heller was there right from the beginning. So Democrats produce mobs.
Republicans produce jobs. That's become hashtag. Right? That's called hashtag. That's a new hashtag. That's a hot one. This November, vote for jobs, not mobs. If Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer, and the radical Democrats take over Congress, which would be a shame, they will try to plunge our country into a nightmare of gridlock, poverty, and chaos.
And by the way, your 401(k)s? Boom, they will go down like a sinking something. What sinks rapidly? Give me -- a rock. They will go down like a rock. Democrats want to massively raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country. We'll be another Venezuela. They want to take away your health care, destroy your Second Amendment, and I think the people in Nevada are not big on having your Second Amendment taken away.
Not a big point. That's not a good sound bite. How do they win an election? Do we really have an election here? Think of it, they want to take away your Second Amendment, they want to raise your taxes, they want to open your borders, let people in, illegally. And then they want to pay for those people for health care, for education.
They want to give them cars, they want to give them driver's licenses. I said last night, we did a great -- we did a great, great rally in Arizona last night, and I said -- I said last night, what kind of car will they supply them? Will it be a Rolls-Royce? The Democrats want to throw open your borders to deadly drugs and gangs and anybody else that wants to come in. And they really have.
And I say this, and at first I used to say, wow, that's a tough statement, but it's true. Democrats are the party of crime. This will be the election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, tax cuts, and common sense. We got you those -- those big taxes. Don't forget the big tax cuts. And we're going to get you more.
The Democrat Party has become too extreme and too dangerous to be trusted with the power that they want. I need everyone here today to cast your vote, ideally today. How about raising your right hand? Do you promise you will leave this site, go out, and cast your vote right now? And hopefully you'll vote for Adam Laxalt and hopefully you'll vote for Dean Heller.
Get out there. But you do, you have early voting. And you can go out and do it today. And that way you don't have to wait. And, you know, a big portion of your state does do early voting, which is surprising. Very unusual. But you're a very unusual state, right? So when you leave, we really hope that you can volunteer, give your directions -- we have volunteers all over the place, they'll give you directions.
We have places right down the road. So go out and do what you have to do. We're going to have a big victory. We have to have a big victory. This state is really one of the states that's talked about. This is a great race. It's an exciting race. He's running against wacky Jacky, right? Wacky Jacky. That's what we need, we need a wacky Jacky in Congress, another one.
We're honored to be joined today by your next governor, Adam Laxalt. Where is Adam? Where is Adam? He's around. Come up here, Adam. He's a great guy. I have known Adam for a long time. He's a veteran, he's a patriot, and he's a real leader. But he is a great, great person. Adam, you got to win, Adam.
All right. Are we motivated? Are we grateful for the president coming here to Elko? The president cares about rural Nevada. He knows how important you all are, how important that we keep the economy going. He has helped bring Elko to 3 percent unemployment. How about that? We have to keep this momentum going.
And we have a clear choice for this state. Are we going to keep Nevada the Nevada we all love, this independent western state, or are we going to turn into California? We're not going to let that happen, are you? We need everybody. We need everybody to get extra motivated. We need to support the president and we need to support Republicans up and down the ticket.
God bless you guys. Thanks so much.
He's doing really well, but you got to go out and you got to vote. You got to. His opponent is a far-left Democrat, you know that, who wants to massively raise your taxes. He wants to raid your health care. He wants to fund socialism, because that's what it is, and he wants to open your borders, wide open.
Other than that, he's a great guy. So everybody needs to get out and vote, today, ideally, but sometime before the 6th for Adam Laxalt. And everybody also needs to support your great congressman, Mark Amodei. Where is he? Where is he? Thank you, Mark. He is a great guy. And another great guy, who I said stay home, Danny -- stay home, Danny, and just work.
Danny Tarkanian, he is a great guy. So you don't get a chance over here to vote for him, so you know what I said? Don't come, Danny. Just stay in your district. But Danny was really great. He's been great. He's been a great friend of ours for a long time. Danny Tarkanian, going to be a great congressman.
Hopefully he gets over the line, because we need him. Finally, I'm thrilled to introduce a man that I spent a long time getting to know. At first I fought him. I said, this guy's tough. What's the story here? Don't forget, I haven't been doing this long, right? You know, some of these guys, the senator came into my office, all right, Politician, and he said how he's had tremendous victory at the ballot booth.
He was trying to convince me to do something. This isn't Dean, somebody else. He said I've been in seven races and, sir, I won five of them. And I said, yeah, I've been in one race and I've won one. And it was the presidency. And it was the presidency. It was the presidency. And we'll have one more race, let's win that one, and I'll say I'm two for two and let somebody have fun.
Then somebody else will have some fun, right? But I got to know Dean very well. And I'll tell you, once we understood each other -- and he's a tough guy and he's a smart guy and he loves this state a lot -- once we really got to know each other and understand, there's no better partner that I had in Washington than Dean Heller.
And he's a fantastic guy with an incredible family, wife, who I just -- we just flew in together. But when it came to tax cuts, there was nobody tougher, there was nobody smarter. When it came to all of the things we're doing, including what we're doing, we got rid of the individual mandate, which is the worst, most unpopular thing from Obamacare.
We actually had Obamacare totally repealed and replaced, we couldn't get one Democrat vote, not one. And we repealed. But now, if you notice, your premiums are way, way down. Nobody thought that was possible. And it's been very much dismantled, but it will be ultimately totally dismantled. We had it done, we were a little disappointed in one vote.
But we were also disappointed that we didn't get one Democrat vote in the Senate. But a man that -- you're right, what do you expect? The one thing they're good at -- I'll tell you what, they're lousy politicians, they have horrible policy. Think of this -- you're running for office and your policy is raise taxes and open borders and crime.
Because basically it's crime. How do you win an election? How do you do it? So the -- the one thing they do, they obstruct. And, you know, their whole campaign, you know what they say? Resist. See, ours is called make America great again. Right? Very soon, we keep going like we're going, sooner than we thought, it's going to be keep America great.
That'll be for the second four years. Keep America great. And you know what theirs is? Theirs is resist. Resist. What do you think of that? Resist. How do you figure that, resist? Isn't that an inspiring -- we are going to resist. What are you going to resist? Anything, anything. But I want to introduce a man that really has done a fantastic job.
I'll tell you, it's true. Once he started -- once we were on the same page, and we are now always on the same page, he has been as strong and tough and smart as anybody in Washington. We got to send him back. We need him badly, Senator Dean Heller.
President Trump, thank you for coming to Elko. Welcome to Trump country. Home of the -- home of the Elko Indians. Home of the Spring Creek Spartans. And designated best small town in America. Mr. President, this is not the swamp. Now, Mr. President, you know a little bit about gold. In fact, I think everything you touch turns to gold.
The mines here in Elko and next door, the Eureka County, produce more coal, more gold here than anywhere else in the country. Welcome to gold country. Now, Mr. President, I had a debate last night. The only reason I had that debate is because you embarrassed my opponent into having it. [Laughter] He came to Las Vegas and said Jacky Rosen will not debate Dean Heller.
Two days later, she agree to a debate. Mr. President, thank you. Now, I want to have a debate in Reno. And she said no. I said I want to have a debate here in Elko, and she said no. She will only campaign in Las Vegas. So let me tell you what the message is. If you're a Republican, if you're a Democrat, or you're an independent, you don't live in Las Vegas, you are written off.
That's the message. So here's is the point. Here's the point. We're going to work hard. We're going to move this country forward. This president is doing a great job. Early voting -- early voting starts today. Let's send a message to the Rosen campaign that we want a senator for all of Nevada. Someone who will fight for Las Vegas, someone who will fight for Reno, someone who will fight for Elko.
My heart is right here in Nevada. That's where my heart is. My voice and your voice is together with mine in Washington, D.C. Mr. President, thank you for making America work again.
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Heller. Thank you very much. Thank you, Senator. And by the way, they did debate last night, and I may be a little bit partial, he really beat her badly. That I will say. He beat her very badly. And, you know, the other thing they don't tell you about wacky Jacky, but I know, because I see where her money is all coming from, like, Los Angeles and New York.
It's not coming from here. It's coming from New York and Los Angeles. She's not getting the money from here. He gets his money from here. He gets his drive and his energy from here, also. So Dean delivers. And every single day, he delivers for our workers and our families, our veterans, our miners. He's delivering.
Our miners, we love the miners. Look at that. Whoa. That's a lot of miners. We love our miners. Dean worked tirelessly to pass V.A. choice, V.A. accountability. You know, 44 years they've been trying to pass these things, choice, so that a veteran is sick, he gets on line, he's got to wait forever. He's got to wait forever, days, weeks, months.
And we just passed -- after 44 years, we just got it passed, I signed it two months ago, Veterans Choice, so that if they have to wait on line for 12 days or 14 days or 32 days, or much longer than that -- can you believe it? People are sick, but not bad. By the time they see the doctor, they're terminally ill.
OK, it could have been solved. They go immediately to see a doctor privately. We pay for their bill. They're fixed. Frankly, it's not what I'm doing it for. We save money, if you can believe this. It's good. We go right to a private doctor. If they have a long wait, they go right to a private doctor. And 44 years, they couldn't get that one passed.
And, you know, V.A. accountability, because, frankly, of the unions and because of civil service, 46 years, V.A. accountability. They treat our veterans badly, you can't do anything. They're sadistic! We had that, too. I'll tell you what, they wouldn't have been sadistic when that veteran was A-OK, because they wouldn't have had a shot at it, right?
Not when the veteran was OK. But they took advantage. And they had a lot of things they did wrong. You couldn't do a thing. You couldn't -- they could steal. They could cheat. They could actually be sadistic, horrible to our veterans. And now we just look at them and we say, get your ass out of here, you're fired.
Forty-four years, so we're pretty good at getting things approved. We're pretty good at getting things approved. You know, in the V.A. choice, I thought it was like a genius thing I thought up, because I heard they were waiting so long, months sometimes to see a doctor, and waiting on line. Can you imagine?
Even if you have something minor, that -- a pill, a prescription, something easy could do. And, by the way, drug prices are going to be coming down. You see that already. But I thought it was so brilliant, I came back to my group, I said, I got the greatest idea, because I haven't been doing this that long, so, you know, it wasn't like high on my list, but it became high.
I did know the veterans were never treated fairly. But I said, I have the greatest idea. We're going to do this. If a veteran has to wait, we're going to send them to a private doctor. We'll pay the bill. What a genius -- I said, I said, how good is that? They said, sir, we've been trying to get it passed for 44 years.
So I was good at getting things passed. That's what I did. A vote for wacky Jacky is a vote to hand control of Congress to Nancy Pelosi... crying Chuck Schumer, and, of course, the legendary Maxine Waters. A low IQ individual. Jacky votes against the people of Nevada every chance she gets. She voted no on tax cuts, no on better health care, no on border security, and Jacky voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities.
I don't think we like sanctuary cities up here. By the way, a lot of people in California don't want them, either. They're rioting now. They want to get out of their sanctuary cities. You know, there's a big turn being made, folks. A lot of these sanctuary cities you've been hearing about in California and other places, but California, they want to get out, they're demanding they be released from sanctuary cities.
Jacky also joined the Democrat assault on Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And don't forget that when you vote. That's why I want you to vote today, because you definitely don't forgot. But don't forget. And we stuck with Justice Kavanaugh, because he was the right man. Top of his class at Yale, Yale Law School.
Never had a problem until he was attacked by these vicious people that knew what they were doing was wrong. And we did the right thing. If you want to stop the radical Democrat mob from taking control of Congress, then you need to go out today ideally and vote for Dean Heller and Adam Laxalt and others that you like, but you got to get them in. Danny Tarkanian, get Danny in. Danny deserves to be in. Democrats in Congress have already signed up for a socialist takeover of health care that would eliminate the private insurance of 1.6 million people from Nevada.
The Democrats want America to become -- it's not even that they want it, but that's what's going to happen -- Venezuela. Venezuela. How does that sound? You like Venezuela? That's a wonderful place. Not doing too well, folks. The Democrat plan would destroy Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage for almost 200,000 Nevada seniors who depend on it. Democrats plan to kill Medicare Advantage and, really, it's especially unfair to Hispanic Americans.
Do we have many Hispanic Americans here? Eh. Not the most. We've done better. Not the most. I'd give it 5 percent. That's ok. But I just left a place, it was 45 percent. But they're happy in every other way, because you know what? Lowest unemployment numbers they've ever had. One out of every two Hispanic seniors is enrolled in Medicare Advantage.
Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and they've paid for it. They've actually -- you know, they have paid for it. And Republicans will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. And the senator, as much as anybody, the senator is going to do that, he's been doing that.
The new platform of the Democrat Party is radical socialism and open borders, which leads to crime, tremendous crime. As we speak, the Democrat Party -- you know, I used to -- everybody used to call it the Democratic Party. That's not the name. And it reads so much nicer. It sounds better. [Audience member calls out Demo-rats] They ought to actually -- I'll give them a little hint.
They should change their name to the Democratic Party. But I call it the Democrat Party, because that's what it is. It's called the Democrat Party. I watch where they're saying the Democratic Party. Usually, in many -- in many cases, those are people that want to make it look as good as possible. But it is, it's the Democrat Party, which doesn't read well.
The other reads better. But we're going to call it the Democrat Party. And it's openly inviting millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and overwhelm our nation. The Democrats want caravans. They like the caravans. A lot of people say, I wonder who started that caravan? I want to thank Mexico.
Mexico has been so incredible. Thank you, Mexico. And the leaders of Mexico, thank you. And do you know why? Because now Mexico respects the leadership of the United States. They haven't done that. They now respect our leadership. Thank you, Mexico, great. We appreciate it. We do. But what they want is -- and by the way, the wall, the people who scream -- so we started the wall.
It's moving along. I want to build it rapidly. I can do it in a year. We did $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion. We have another $1.6 billion -- sounds like a lot of money. When you're going for almost a thousand miles, it's not that much. But the wall is moving. I want to do it in one year. I want them to approve the wall.
The Democrats don't care about what their extremist immigration agenda will do to your communities, to your hospitals, what about your hospitals? And to your schools. The Democrats don't care that a flood of illegal immigration will bankrupt our country. You saw the site. Did anybody see that bridge over the weekend?
Did you see the bridge yesterday, today? I mean, is that an incredible situation? It's sad. And it's sad -- honestly, it's sad from both sides. It's sad from their side, also. We're going to figure it out. I'll be honest with you, I have already figured it out. You're going to be happy. We're going to make a lot of people happy.
We're going to make a lot of people happy. I think I'll keep it a little bit low key until the election. I like where we stand in the election. You know, I think that blue wave is being rapidly shattered. You know, all the Democrats want is power, and they got this blue wave deal going. Not looking like a blue wave.
I think Dean Heller is going to win here. I think Martha McSally, she was great last night. She's going to win. She's going to win. I think -- I just visited the great state of big sky. You know what big sky is? Just left. And I'll tell you that, they're going to win. They're going to win in Montana. We're going to win all over.
I think we're going to win in Indiana. I think we're going to win Josh. I think we're going to win in Missouri. I think Rick Scott is going to win in the great state of Florida. You're going to have a great governor in Florida. You know who our governor is, right? He's going to be, right? You know who I'm talking about.
He's going to be fantastic in Florida. We have a lot of -- big Ron. We call him Ron. Harvard, Yale, smart. Ron DeSantis, he's going to be a great governor of Florida, just like Adam, Adam Laxalt is going to be a great governor for you. You need it. You need it. And, you know, you really do. You need people that can work with Washington, because you take a lot out of Washington.
And you need people that we look forward to working with, not people that we have no respect for. This is why Democrats on the border have such bad concepts, catch and release. Do you know what that is? They catch, they get them, and then they say, oh, goodbye, release them. And do you know what happens to that person?
He gets released into our country, into our society. That's why Democrats want to give illegal aliens free welfare and free health care. That's why Democrats want to give illegal immigrants the right to vote. I'll tell you, we'll go down fighting for that one. Can you imagine? People -- you know, the vote was always so sacred.
Now you see these things where they want the right to vote. They want the right to vote. There's one town in California were they want to take over the -- illegal immigrants want to take over the control of the board that runs the town, all illegal immigrants. And, you know, you would think they're kidding.
Seriously, would you even believe this? And they are serious. And I know some people, and they're serious people, they're smart people, where -- what happened to them? What's going on? And that's why Democrats, they want to abolish ICE. Think about that one. So ICE, these are great patriots, great people, great law enforcement.
They're tough. They have to be tough. You see what they're dealing with? I'm not going to send you or you -- I'm not going to send you -- they have to be -- yeah, I'll send you. I might send you. I might send her. [Laughter] They saw you. I won't tell you what they're thinking if they saw you. [Laughter] I think if they saw you, they'd be happy, very, very happy.
But these are people that are tough people we're dealing with. These aren't -- I got criticized for using the word babies. One of the newscasts said, he used the word babies. I was trying to figure, is that politically incorrect? I said these aren't babies, right? These are tough people. And all of a sudden, why did he use the term babies?
I said don't tell me that's politically incorrect, too. Last night, last night, in Arizona, we had -- you never saw so many people. I said, I want to thank the great men that are here and I want to thank the beautiful women, everyone beautiful, everyone. And I said, ah, I better apologize, because if I don't -- for calling you all beautiful, because if I don't apologize, they will go wild tomorrow.
Headlines, Donald Trump called women beautiful. They're all saying, "Please call me beautiful." It is a crazy phenomenon that's going on. But you know what, women? You are beautiful. To me, you're beautiful. Every one of you is beautiful. Every one. Tomorrow, headlines, Trump in Nevada was terrible what he said.
No, I'm telling you, these people have lost their way. They've gone loco. Headed by the crowd of fake news back there, I will say. I'll tell you, honestly, the single greatest ally that the Democrats have is the fake news media, because without that, these crazy ideas -- I can't believe they'd go anywhere.
You know, if I had the media on my side and with what we've accomplished, because nobody has done more than all of us, nobody has done more in the first two years, and we're not even at two years yet. But nobody has done anything close. If they were on my side, instead of always -- everything is -- they'll take a big victory try and make it into a loss.
They're very dishonest people. If they were on my side, I think I'd be at 100 percent right now. You know, 100 -- I really believe it. They'd have breaking news, President Trump, his approval rating has just hit 100 percent, 100 percent. Lot of truth. I mean, look at the economy. Look at North Korea. We were going to war with North Korea.
It was going to be -- now look at it. It's going to be fine. Going to be fine. Take your time. Going to be fine. No missiles shot. We got our hostages back. Hey, look at Pastor Brunson. Look at Pastor Brunson. We got Pastor Brunson back. We got 20 back since I'm there. And, you know -- I won't go into it. But we got him back the right way.
We got him back the right way. Pastor Brunson just came back. It was such a beautiful -- he was with his family, the most beautiful children, great wife, everything. And it was a beautiful thing. We got Pastor Brunson back. He was -- he was taken during the Obama administration years, and they never came close.
And I said, yeah, got to have him back. Got to have him back. I'm sorry. We've got to have him back. We got him back. He's home. He's home. Nice man. The casualties in the Democrats' open borders crusade are really a lot. Far more than anybody would know, of innocent American families and lives. Democrat immigration policies allow poisonous drugs and MS-13 killers to pour into our country.
These are not people that you don't want to have ICE around. ICE goes into these nests, you know, they're nests, MS-13. I call them a nest. They go into the nest like ho-hum, it's a day in the office. You understand. Because I'm telling you, you guys, even the tough guys here, you don't want to do it. You don't want to do it. She's done it, she said.
[Laughter] If you did it, you didn't do it by choice. Ah, she said, no, I didn't. What's this story all about? I want to find out about this story. Come on up here -- no, I'm kidding. And the Democrats sanctuary cities release -- and this is what happens, they release violent predators out of jail and straight into your communities, and then they're protected.
These are protected people. A Democrat victory in November would be a bright, flashing invitation to every human trafficker, drug trafficker -- think of it. But think of it. Human trafficking is the highest it's ever been in the history of this world. Can you -- because of the Internet. You know, you wouldn't think human trafficking, they steal people, they traffic people.
And that is a massive business because of the Internet, the computers, wonderful computer age, right? Maybe it was better the other way, right? Maybe. But then you wouldn't have @RealDonaldTrump. That wouldn't be so good, right? But -- but think of it. Human trafficking is worse than it's ever been, OK, worse than it's ever been, and you would think that would be impossible.
Who would even think about this? But drug trafficking, drug dealing, illegal aliens all over the planet, and we are stopping it. A Republican victory will send the message that America will enforce our borders and defend our citizens. That's what we want. This is your choice in November. Can you believe it's almost two years?
Can you believe that? Remember that beautiful November 8th? Don't get that confused -- don't get that confused with November 6th. I'll just mention it one more time, November 8th, was that a great, great day? That was the greatest political movement in the history of our country, maybe anywhere. And they never questioned me on that.
You know they want to. Because, you know, they'd say -- I'd like to give him a Pinocchio, four Pinocchios. They never question me on that. Look, watch. Was that the greatest single political movement in the history of our country? Peter? Peter, yes, Peter Doocy. The great Peter Doocy. There is no doubt who his father is. Look at him.
Peter's -- here, was this the greatest political movement in history? Don't answer it [Inaudible] All right, good to have you all. We're having a good time. Democrats believe illegal border crossers should be set free immediately. Republicans believe illegal border crossers have to be brought back home immediately.
Democrats believe our country should be a sanctuary for criminal aliens. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans. Democrats believe American taxpayers should provide free welfare to illegals. Republicans believe welfare should be protected for truly needy Americans.
If you want to save your country, if you want to protect your family, if you want to defend America's laws, borders, sovereign, and even your dignity, then you have to go out today and vote. You got to go out and vote. Now, if you're thinking about voting Democrat, don't go out today and vote. Don't go. I would say there may be -- for the media -- no Democrats in this audience.
Would you say? Is there anybody here that wants to vote Democrat? Seriously? A lot of people. Now, the press never shows how many people, you know? They show, like, my face. And they never leave. And I'll say to my wife, Melania, is she doing a great job as first lady? I will say to my wife, honey, you should have seen the crowd, it was unbelievable.
I mean, we had in Missouri 45,000 people that couldn't get into a 10,000-seat arena because it was packed. And I said, did they show the crowd? No. All they do is they keep it right here. They never move it around. I wish you'd move the cameras around. Just move it around. And this is Elko, pretty amazing.
Amazing. Pretty amazing. And by the way, Joe Biden is in Las Vegas. Joe. Sleepy Joe Biden. We call him 1 percent Joe because he ran at least twice, I think three times, they say twice, I think he ran three times, and he never had more than 1 percent. So we call him 1 percent Joe. And then, oh, remember what happened?
And then Obama came along and took him off of the trash heap and made him vice president. But he never had more than 1 percent, so we call him either sleepy Joe Biden or 1 percent. Which is better? Sleepy Joe? Sleepy Joe. Oh, no, she said creepy Joe. Not creepy. Creepy. She said creepy Joe. I -- no, I would never do that.
I would never insult him like that. She said she's only kidding. I would never insult. But listen to this. So we have a lot of people. And we have 6,000, 7,000 people over here that couldn't get in. And here's the thing. Here's the thing. Biden, they just said the count, 193 people showed up. And we love Elko, but in all fairness, it is easier to draw a crowd in Las Vegas.
Do we agree? We want to be here, but it is, right? Yeah, he had 193 people. And he was thrilled. That's one of the biggest crowds he's ever had. [Laughter] This election is also about prosperity. In less than two years, we have created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps.
Hispanic American household income has reached an all-time high. Hispanic American poverty has reached an all-time historic low. Hispanic American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded in history. African American and Asian American unemployment have reached their lowest rates ever recorded in history.
And women's unemployment just fell to 3.6 percent, which is still the same best number in 65 years. I can't get rid of that number. I can't get rid of that number. I wanted to be in history, and I can't -- I'm sorry, women, I apologize. Women have the best number in 65 years. And I have to apologize, because African American and Hispanic and Asian, it's history.
Women, it's only at 65 years. You know what? Remember they used to say two years ago, he'll never get the women's vote. I got the women's vote. I got the women's vote. And look at all the women signs, Peter! Look at all those signs, Peter! Look, women for Trump. I'll tell you what, I think women like me more now than they did two years ago.
I... Because they want safety, they want security, they want their husband and themselves to have great 401(k)s, right? Remember, you're going to pay a big price if you vote for somebody else, because what's going to happen, it's going to be cut down big, remember I told you. You're going to say, what the hell is happening to our 401(k) as it does a big nosedive?
And I'm talking 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent. Those are the numbers we're talking about, OK? Because when I took over, this place was heading south. If we didn't free up the regulations that were strangling our country, if we didn't do the tax cuts -- and I think maybe the regulations are the most important -- people don't see it -- but we opened up hundreds of thousands of jobs right away.
The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. Every day we are living by our motto, promises made, promises kept. Right? It's even better than that. Earlier this month, I announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal with the incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.
The USMCA is a tremendous victory for Nevada farmers and ranchers, and for all farmers and ranchers, and everybody, for manufacturers. It's fantastic. And I'll tell you what, again, Mexico is treating us differently. They're treating us with respect. And part of that is the relationship we developed with Mexico and with Canada in making this deal.
NAFTA was a disaster. Millions and millions of jobs were lost to NAFTA. And to this day, that thing should have been terminated two weeks after it signed. It was. It was obsolete, and they made mistakes, and they never even corrected the mistakes. We lived with them for 25 years. So we've taken the toughest-ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices.
We're doing very well. As Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We have taken -- and that's Dean Heller was right at the front. We have taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. We have launched a historic effort to combat the opioid -- where I know you have a big problem here -- the opioid epidemic, signing the largest bill focused on fighting opioid addiction, and fighting the spread of opioid all over this country.
Largest in American history. Last year, we had $6 billion in our budget. By the way, is that sun hot or what? Man. I'm saying it. This wasn't part of the game. I'll -- I'll end up with a nice tan, that's OK. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion for our military. Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been in the history of our country.
And we gave our warriors the largest pay raise in almost a decade, our warriors, our military. And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch, and Dean is helping, but it's been very popular, I may even get Democrat votes, can you believe that? Sixth branch, because this is where it's at. The American armed forces sixth branch is called the Space Force.
Space Force! I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It was a catastrophe. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Together we have made extraordinary progress, but we are just getting started. We have to get some more Republican votes.
You know, they always say we have the majority. Our majority is like this. I say, if somebody has a cold and they can't come in, we lose the majority, so we have to wait until they get better. We need more Republicans in D.C. If you vote to elect a Republican House and a Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, to cut regulations, and to raise your incomes, like we've been doing.
Your incomes have gone way up. We will protect Medicare and we will protect your Social Security. And remember, when I was on that stage, I was the only one that said I'm going to protect your Social Security, and I have. And you've heard a lot of talk from a lot of people about Social Security. You never heard it from Donald J. Trump.
Because the Democrats will end up destroying them both, Medicare, Social Security. We will defend the Second Amendment. And there is a tremendous amount of pressure being put right now on your Second Amendment. We will defend it. You don't have to worry about that. Protect your right to free speech and religious liberty.
And we will continue to confirm judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border. We will pass Kate's law. We will stop sanctuary cities. We will stop catch and release, and the visa lottery catastrophe, and the chain migration catastrophe. And we will keep the drug dealers the hell out of our country.
We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for you and for America. [Audience Chants USA] We are standing up for your values.
We are standing up for Nevada. And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. But to continue this incredible momentum to protect your state and your country, you need to vote Republican. You have to do it. Go out today and vote, Dean Heller, Adam Laxalt, go out and vote. A vote for Republicans is a vote for more jobs, for more wealth, for more products made right here.
Remember the old days, made in the USA? That's happening again. Made in the USA. It's a vote to respect our laws and respect the heroes of law enforcement. Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of hatred, anger, and division, and to celebrate the greatness and the glory of being American.
Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people. And when you see me tomorrow, and you'll say, oh, isn't that so bad, look, he's so sunburned? Just remember, Elko, you did it to me. You did it. It's you. The great state -- and this is really a great state -- was settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women.
And I'll add: Strong and beautiful pioneer women. And I'll also add: Who are tougher than the men, actually. Who took the risks and defied the dangers to build a life, a home, and to build a dream. You didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God.
These courageous Nevada patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others erase the legacy and destroy our proud American heritage. That's what they're doing. They want to destroy our American heritage. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win.
Very simple. We're going to keep winning, too, win. Nothing like winning, folks. Nothing like winning. We will not bend, we will not break, we will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, we will never surrender, and we will always go on to victory. Because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue.
We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will be so proud. We will be so proud. How proud are we? Are we proud? You know, America is respected again. I was at the United Nations and the leaders of the countries were coming up to me, countries that couldn't have cared less, and they're saying, I must tell you, Mr. President, America is respected again.
So we're going to go on. And we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you, Elko.
Hello, Pennsylvania. Hello, Pennsylvania. Great people. Incredible people. And I'm thrilled to be here tonight in Erie, Pennsylvania, with thousands of loyal, hard-working, and beautiful American patriots. That's what you are. Before we begin, I want to send our thoughts and prayers of our entire nation to everyone in the path of Hurricane Michael, especially in the Florida panhandle, where it's hitting and hitting hard.
It's a big one, one of the biggest we've ever seen. All of Pennsylvania, all of America sends its unwavering love and support. My administration is working closely with Florida Governor Rick Scott and the governors of North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, anybody else affected, to provide the full resources and steadfast support of our federal government.
We are... We're all set to go. We're going to follow it right in. We have massive amounts of water and food. And we have the electric companies, thousands and thousands of electrical workers, they're going to follow it as it leaves. We're going to follow right behind. Help the situation. Everyone's working in close coordination with local officials.
And I'll be traveling to Florida very, very shortly, so we just want to wish them all the best. And Godspeed. Godspeed. God bless you all. And you know -- and I speak because so many of my friends are here with us in Pennsylvania, we will spare no effort, no expense, no resource to help these great fellow citizens of ours that are going through a tough time right now.
We know when Americans face hardship, we support each other, we stand with each other, we care for each other, and we will always pull through. It will be successful. We will always be successful at what we do. Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, again, two weeks ago, and now they're going to get a lot more water coming in. That's what they don't need is water right now.
These are great people. Tonight we are going to discuss the extraordinary achievements we've made for our fellow citizens in less than two years' time. You know, it's been less than two years. All those beautiful red hats, Make America Great Again... And we will discuss the next steps we must take to protect this amazing progress and to continue building an even greater future for all Americans.
That's what's happening. You look at what's going on. It's been incredible. I said the other night -- and you know that these folks will dispute us if we're wrong. But this has been the greatest revolution ever to take place in our country. Here we are. The greatest ever. I remember, during the primaries and prior to the election, they were saying, wow, this is -- this is something not -- there's been nothing like this since Ronald Reagan.
Then it kept going and going and going, and then we actually won. In Tennessee, I remember a great Congressmen Duncan, they said, he said, sir, early voting. He said, sir, they're coming from the hills, the valleys, people that haven't voted for a long time because they didn't want to vote for the people that were running for office.
And they've got Trump banners and Trump hats and Trump tattoos. I've never seen anything like it. All about you. And he was right. [Audience Chants USA] And then after that, they said, well, we have to go back further than Ronald Reagan, so they talk about Andrew Jackson and said, let's see, the 1830s, that's a long time.
And then they said on election night that this superseded even Andrew Jackson. So you won it. It's yours. And we're doing well. We're doing well. We are producing and doing even better than we said we would. It's been amazing. This election is about your families, your values, and what kind of country you want to leave for your children.
This election is about keeping America safe, keeping America strong, keeping America proud, keeping America free. And this has been a historic week for our nation. And you know what I'm talking about. You know, all my life I've heard that a president's most important decision is who he or she picks for the United States Supreme Court.
And as you know, on Monday night, we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Kavanaugh now sits alongside Justice Gorsuch... to defend your rights, your Constitution, and your God-given freedom. Two great men. They will go down as great, great justices of the Supreme Court.
You watch. What the radical Democrats did to Brett Kavanaugh and his beautiful family is a national disgrace. It's a disgrace. What they did was a disgrace. You look at Cory Booker, the way he talked, and then you look at what he did. You look at Senator Dianne Feinstein, what she did. The disgraceful behavior.
The disgraceful leaking of documents. You look at what they did. You look at the false charges. You look at the false accusations. It was a disgrace. It was a disgrace! And people were saying, thank you, sir, for sticking and thank you for not giving up. You know what? I never even thought of it, folks. I never even thought of it. Never even thought of it. But on November 6th, you can vote to reject the Democrats' shameful conduct by electing Republican House and, really, we need it badly, we need these votes, a Republican Senate.
Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, and America is winning like never before, because we are finally putting America first. Just two days ago, the unemployment rate has fallen to the lowest level in 50 years. It was just announced that manufacturing confidence is at an all-time high.
Historic. Big thing, confidence. You remember the previous administration? They said, oh, you can't bring back manufacturing jobs. Really? You can't bring back... That was wrong. Remember they said you'd need a magic wand. Well, we've got -- I guess we have, right -- we have a magic wand. And those are our great jobs.
And we are unleashing the power of Pennsylvania shale and clean, beautiful Pennsylvania coal, beautiful, beautiful, clean coal. We are putting our miners back to work. We are putting our steelworkers back to work. And by the way, I don't know how many people are in the steel industry, but one of the hottest industries -- and this was dying.
The steel industry was dead and dying. One of the hottest industries right now in our country is American steel. U.S. Steel is opening and expanding seven different plants and spending a tremendous -- billions of dollars doing it. And what does it mean for you? Jobs, jobs, very simple. What does it mean for our country?
What does it mean for our country? We can't lose the steel industry. The steel industry was on its last legs, and now, after four months of really intensely doing what I do... it's thriving. It is thriving. It's amazing, actually. It's amazing. You got to have steel. You know, you need steel for defense.
You got to have steel. Supposing you don't have steel and we do have a problem defense-wise. You going to call China, please send us some steel? And aluminum is doing great again. These are things we have to have. But beyond that, it's tremendous numbers of jobs already taking place. The head of U.S. Steel said he's never seen anything like it. And what did we do? We essentially stopped the dumping.
They were dumping garbage all over our country. It wasn't even good. It was sand steel. It was rotted steel. It was garbage. They're dumping it all over our country. So now we can take our own metallurgic ore out of our mines that we can bring it here and to other places, and we can actually have our industry.
We don't need this product coming in untested from other countries. We don't need it, folks. We've got it here. We don't need it. And you watch what's going to happen with jobs, and you watch what's going to happen with price. Very proud of that industry. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation.
But if Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats... take over Congress, they will try to raise your taxes -- we've lowered them tremendously -- impose socialism, which is where they're coming from... and take over and destroy American health care. And you see how well we're doing with health care. You see it. Democrats want to abolish America's borders and allow drugs and gangs to pour into our country unabated.
And I say this, and I mean this. The Democrats are the party of crime. That's what's happening. They are the party of crime. Republicans are the party of law, order, and justice. And we are also the party of jobs, jobs, jobs. You see that. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by several really terrific friends of mine, Pennsylvania Republicans, including a man that's helped me so much in Washington, like tax cuts, like regulation cuts, like many other things, Congressman GT Thompson.
A man who's really doing well, if you believe in polls. I believe in polls. Only the ones that have us up, because they're the only honest ones. [Laughter] Other than that, they're the fake news poll. Fake news. Fake news. You know they take these polls, they show them, I said, that can't be right. What they want to do is keep you out of the voting booth.
Take your wife, take your husband, go to a movie, come back, watch the results. You say, you know, I love so and so, but the polls say he can't win. Darling, let's go to a movie tonight. We'll go home and we'll watch -- and that's what happens. They talk you out of it. They're dishonest. just like their reporting is dishonest, their polls are dishonest.
Not all of them. Not all of them. No, not all of them. But many of them, and I saw it. I saw it. And yet there were some that got us very right on that great, great evening. Was that the most exciting evening of our lives? Remember, we won Florida? And remember John King, nice guy at CNN, fake news, CNN... Remember, early -- it was early, and we won by a lot.
We won Florida by a lot. Remember the red, right, the red, beautiful red. I never liked red so much. [Laughter] Against the blue, I didn't like blue. [Laughter] And the whole map is like red. And he's going crazy. But early, Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Oh, my gosh. Donald Trump has won the state of Florida.
Oh, that was upsetting to him. Remember when they said that Texas would be long, it would be a long call, go late into the night, because they said it's just going to be too close to call? So the polls closed at 8 o'clock, and they never call them early unless you win by a landslide, right? So the polls closed.
The polls have closed in the state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas. Right? Which other one? Utah, remember it was so -- it was so close, Utah. They had a guy that I never saw before. I don't know. There's this guy. Do you know who I'm talking about? And they had crooked Hillary, the three of us. And this guy was supposed to come in second, but I was going to be -- it's going to be very close.
Maybe I could edge, but this guy was going to come either first or second, and crooked Hillary was supposed to be third. So, the Utah, great people. We just gave over millions of acres of great space, public space to Utah. So what happens? What happens? So they say, oh, for weeks I'm hearing how close Utah is. So the polls close at 8 o'clock.
Eight o'clock and three seconds, Donald Trump has won... the state of Utah. We won it by... And on top of that, this guy came in third. He didn't even come in second. Crooked Hillary came in second. A long ways away. Long ways. Remember? Anyway. But was that the most exciting night? Was that the greatest?
Well, if you look at it, when you think of it, there was collusion between Hillary, the Democrats, and Russia. There was collusion. There's no question about it. There was a lot of collusion with them and Russia and lots of other people, by the way. But so you remember -- so we win Florida, then we had a -- you know, to win the Electoral College is very tough.
The other is easier. You go to three or four states and you work, and you do -- but to win, got to be smart. You're right. You got to be smart. Got to be smart. You got to -- and you have to have great support. This is our support. But you got to run the whole East Coast. If you're a Republican, it's very, very hard.
Electoral College is much harder than anything. Remember, they said, there is no path. I heard this so many times. I said to my wife, oh -- our first lady, how's she doing? Good? I said to Melania, I said, I've heard there is no path, there is no path to 270. Right? How many times have you heard that? Thousands?
I've been hearing it for months. There is no path. And I kept going -- I love this state -- I kept going to Maine, for one, because they had -- maybe, if I have a great night, 269. Of course they could never say I could get to -- so I kept going to Maine five times, because I wanted to get one, and I ended up getting the one in Maine, but I also got Michigan, and Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.
Remember that? Remember that? And what angered me, because I love this state, and I went to school in this state, right? I went to school in this state. I love Pennsylvania. I went to school in this state. Great place. Great people. What angered me is Pennsylvania hasn't been won for many years by Republicans, but every Republican thinks they're going to win Pennsylvania.
They didn't quite get it. But I got it. The workers, I got it. Every Republican -- I used an expression. You know, there's an expression, but under the rules of "Me, Too," I'm not allowed to use that expression anymore. Can't do it. [Laughter] It's the person that got away. See, in the old days, it was a little different.
Pennsylvania -- I'll just do it anyway. I would do it, except for these people up there. They would say, did you hear what President Trump said? Did you hear what he said? So there is expression, but we'll change the expression. Pennsylvania was always the person that got away. That's pretty good, right?
The person that got -- and for many years, nobody -- no Republican won Pennsylvania. And -- but they always thought they were going to. Pennsylvania, great. And then they lost it by a lot. I said I know we're going to win Pennsylvania, but all night long, they had one point. But if I lost every single vote in Pennsylvania, I was 99 percent of the vote cast, and I said, will you please project Pennsylvania?
Let Pennsylvania be the state where I win this election? I was winning North Carolina, South Carolina. We won Florida. We were doing -- we were running the East Coast. And I kept saying, why aren't they -- and ask them. Ask them. Why aren't they announcing Pennsylvania? One point left, 99 percent of the vote cast, right?
Ninety-nine percent of the vote cast. One point left. If I lost every single vote, I won Pennsylvania by a lot. I kept saying, why aren't they announcing Pennsylvania? I thought it must be some kind of a technical malfunction. [Laughter] So they didn't do it until late in the evening. It stayed forever. I kept going, why aren't they announcing?
I'd love to win with Pennsylvania. But honestly, then what happened? Out of the blue, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. And then out of the blue, first time in decades, Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan. And then finally they announced, late in the morning, which we knew they just couldn't do it. They couldn't do it. They just couldn't. Donald Trump has won the great state of Pennsylvania.
They didn't do it that way. They didn't do it that way. They didn't do it that way. They did it with tears flowing down their face. This can't be happening. Can this -- did you see some of them crying? And we were all crying, too, out of happiness, right? Because there has never been anything like what we all did.
OK? We did it together. And now we're doing great trade deals. We're fixing our military. We're taking care of our vets. We are doing so much. We're cutting regulations. So you have a congressional candidate running, taking the place of a fantastic person. You know who that is. But you have a man named John Joyce who's running, and he's way up in the polls, but don't let that fool you.
Get out and vote. Get out and vote. John Joyce. Where is John? Thank you, John. State Senators Dan Laughlin and Michele Brooks, and your next governor of the state of Pennsylvania -- I'll tell you, this guy is working hard, folks. He said he did 631 events. I said that's a lot. [Laughter] I'll tell you, he's a really good man and he's a hard-worker, and I know it's a tough race.
But based on competence, based on everything, very successful guy. Successful businessman, which we like. Scott Wagner. Scott? And maybe the best thing I can say about Scott Wagner is that Judge Jeanine thinks he's fantastic, OK? That might be the greatest endorsement. And I -- you have my full endorsement.
That might be the greatest endorsement I can give you, Scott. Judge Jeanine. I'm especially thrilled to introduce a terrific Pennsylvania congressmen. He's been a friend of mine for a long time, long before I did this whole political thing. A congressmen came up to me the other day, he said, sir, I've been winning for many years and I'm a proud congressmen.
I've won many races, 10 to be exact. I've only lost three. I said, you lost three? Yes, a long time ago, when I was young. And I'm very proud, I'm a real professional. I said, you know, I've never thought of it that way, but I've only ran one time, one... It was for the presidency. And we won the presidency, right?
We won the president. Now, I had to do it, because he was bragging about his political career. This wasn't Mike Kelly, by the way. Somebody else. And I had to do it. I said, I never thought of it that way, but I ran one time, and we won. OK. And it's also the presidency, right? So, you know. But a man that's been a friend of mine for a long time, he's a tremendous man, and his name is Congressmen Mike Kelly.
He loves you people. And just like your other congressmen, and John Joyce, just like your other congressmen, Mike is strong on crime, tough as hell on borders, powerful on trade, and he is really great on jobs. You see what he's doing. Mike was leading the fight, along with JT and the others, in Congress to cut your taxes, which we did at a level that they haven't seen before, cut regulations, and to protect American workers and American steelworkers.
We're going to dredge the channel to Lake Erie. And we're going to replenish the sand to Presque Isle. Do you know what Presque Isle is? Presque Isle. They've been talking about that for a long time. Mike keeps calling, sir, we want to fix up Presque Isle. I said, Mike, what the hell is Presque Isle? [Laughter] He said, sir, it's a beautiful beach.
I had a picture sent to me. There's no sand. That's what he wants. He wants sand. And we're going to get him the sand, OK? We're going to get him the sand. So, he's a great guy. You got to go vote for him. Let me just invite just for a couple of seconds, Mike, please, come on up. [Audience Chants USA]
Oh, OK, you know what? Listen, listen, President Trump and I have so much in common. First of all, he loves Pennsylvania... and he -- and he made a commitment tonight. He said, what can we do to make it even better in Erie than it is now? What can we do to take the greatest of the Great Lakes and make it better?
I said, Mr. President, we need to get sand replenishment. He said, how much do you need? I said, I'm not sure. He said, let me know. You're knowing to get that sand. Yeah! And then he said, so what else? What else? I said, you know what, we need to get some dredging done in the channel so that we don't have to light load any more, our ships can come in and out and get out to the world and bring goods in at a much cheaper price.
He said, you know what, we're going to do that, too! And then I said to the president, you know what, Mr. President, you and I have a lot more in common than probably most people understand. And he goes, what would that be? I said, well, sir, we both married up. [Laughter] We both married up! So this beautiful girl standing beside me tonight, mother of four, grandmother of 10, and five of them are over there right now with my son, George, retired Army captain, and they're here because they love this president.
Look, you know that in 2016, candidate Donald Trump came here to this same arena, to a crowd that was almost as big as this. My god, we got thousands of people outside that just want to get in. There's just not enough room for all the love. The president as a candidate said, this will not be my first trip to Erie, Pennsylvania.
This will not be my first time to stand on the shores of the Great Lake Erie. He said, I will be back. But you know what he also did? He made promises to us in 2016. And people said, no, no, no, there's no way he can do that. There's no way we can get there. My gosh, we just spent eight years of somebody telling us in the White House that America's best days have left her.
And you foolish, foolish people. You Americans actually still seem to think that you're exceptional. You are not exceptional! I want to tell you something. Promises made, promises kept. The strongest personality, the strongest president we have seen in our lifetime! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! [Audience Chants USA] Listen, I got to tell you, the last 21 months of my life, I have seen something happen in America that I had never seen before.
I have seen the resurrection of the greatest nation the world has ever known. It knows no boundaries. It doesn't differentiate because of the color of your skin, the shape of your eye, what your gender is, where you worship. Every single American and at every single way every single day is stronger because of this man.
You're the best. You are the best! Now, let me let you in on a little secret. You know, all of us deplorables are here tonight. Yeah, we're all here! But you know there's another group out there that says, you know what, we've got to win these midterms. We've got to knock this president off his perch. We've got to knock America down a notch or two.
Well, I'll tell you, the president said, we're going to win, and we're going to keep on winning, and you're going to get tired of winning. I'll tell you, in Erie, Pennsylvania, we never get tired of winning. That's who we are! I'm going to ask you all -- I'm going to ask you all to do one thing tonight. As you look at this gentleman, who left a life that was so comfortable, who left a life that was so luxurious, to be torn apart every day, to have our first lady attacked every day, to have the first family attacked every day... that is not who we are.
Now, you know how you're going to change that? You're going to take the enthusiasm you have tonight, you're going to take the love that you have in your heart for the greatest country in the greatest nation in the history of mankind, and you're going to get out and vote. You're going to show up in numbers that nobody ever thought would turn out.
Now, listen. There's an old saying. You've got to play it through the whistle. Right? You got to play it through the whistle. You know what this man's saying is? You've got to play it through the echo of the whistle. Listen, I am so grateful and so thankful that an American citizen came out of nowhere to take the reins and reform and recommit this country to the greatest, greatest nation the world's ever known.
I got to tell you, I'm with you, we're all together. Let's go win! Let's go win! Let's go win! [Audience Chants USA]
What do you think of that, folks? And, truly, look, he's in good shape. You see that. How would you like to be his opponent? [Laughter] But still, you never know. A vote for Mike is a vote to make America great again. It's very simple. I want to introduce another congressmen who has been a friend of mine, also, for a long time.
And he had a very sad day yesterday. He lost his brother. He lost his brother. And he loved his brother like crazy. I said, how close? He said the closest. And a very, very strange, horrible thing happened. And he doesn't want to talk about it. But I will tell you it's a hard thing for him. And he loves this state, he loves the people.
He's been an incredible congressman. He was a politician and various things. He went on to become a great congressman. He is so respected in Washington. And the only bad thing when he said he's going to do this, at my suggestion, I said, Lou, I'm telling you, you can win. And he said, well, if you think it's important.
It was really at my suggestion. In other words, I got him into this. [Laughter] It could have been for the rest of his life. He could have been a congressman. But he's a special man. He's a total winner. And he had a rough time the last few days. And something else happened on top of that. But I'm honored to introduce the next United States senator from the state of Pennsylvania, my good friend, Lou Barletta. [Audience Chants Lou]
Thank you. Thank you very much. You know, Mr. President, I happen how much you love Pennsylvania. This is like the 9th or 10th time that you've been here. And each time that you come, the list of promises made, promises kept gets longer and longer. And that's OK with us, because now you're overseeing the greatest economy in American history right now.
This economy is soaring. GDP last month was 4.2 percent. Unemployment, 3.7 percent. Four million new jobs were created. And this is the stat I love the most: Four million Americans came off of food stamps. Four million Americans came off of food stamps. Black unemployment at an all-time low. Hispanic unemployment at an all-time low.
Women's unemployment at a 64-year low. There are more jobs than people who are unemployed. And I'll tell you how good the economy is: This economy is so good that even Colin Kaepernick found a job. Now, who would want to stop that? Who would want to stop what's happening to the American people right now?
I'll tell you who wants to stop it: Bob Casey wants to stop it. Senator Bob Casey went to Washington and he forgot about Pennsylvania. He became -- in Washington, he became -- it's no surprise -- he became one of the most liberal senators in Washington. He no longer represents Pennsylvania values. I'll tell you how radical -- I'll tell you how radical he has become.
He is so radical that he said he will vote no, no matter who the president nominates for the next Supreme Court pick. No matter who. Now, he started this craziness. He started this craziness by saying he'd be the first senator to vote no, no matter what. If you don't like the way that Justice Kavanaugh has been treated, then you can't reward Bob Casey by sending him back to Washington ever again.
Listen, it's pretty clear -- it's pretty clear why I'm running for Senate. I'm running for Senate because the president did call and he said, I need you in the Senate. I'm running there because I want to help him because we want to show respect for our law enforcement in America once again. We want to take care of our veterans.
No veterans should ever and will ever die waiting in line for health care in this country ever again. And we're going to support our military, those men and women who travel all over this world to make sure that we have the freedoms that we have and enjoy today and that our children and grandchildren will have that same freedom.
We're going -- we're going to take care of our seniors. We're going to protect the unborn. We're going to put an end to illegal immigration. We're going to -- we're going to build the wall. We're going to build the way. And we are going to kneel when we pray and stand for the flag. No, Mr. President. No, Mr. President, we're not tired of winning in Pennsylvania. We're going to win again in November. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States. Thank you. [Audience Calls Out Lou]
That's great, Lou. Thank you very much. He's a great man. He's really -- he'll be a fantastic representative for you in Washington, D.C. Got to get out and vote. [Audience Calls Out Lou] So while Lou is fighting for you, Bob Casey is fighting to protect violent criminal aliens. That's what he's doing. Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania streets, to prey all over this country.
He'll do it. For example, the sanctuary city of Philadelphia, can you believe this? Could you believe that one? That one I didn't expect to be hearing -- released a criminal alien who was recently convicted of raping and battering a very young child. Bob Casey defends criminals while attacking our brave ICE agents.
He wants to get rid of ICE. Let me tell you about ICE. These are tough, brave people that love our country. These are people that MS-13, they're afraid of ICE. They don't like seeing ICE. And if we don't have ICE, you'll pay a big price. These are great people. These are great people. Lou Barletta and the Republican Party will always stand for the heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, and our great, great law enforcement.
These are great people. Bob Casey even voted against Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was gunned down by a five-time deported illegal alien, should have never been in our country. Bob Casey puts criminal aliens before American citizens, always has. By the way, how do you have such a liberal guy in the state of Pennsylvania?
I'm trying to figure that out. Oh, he's banking on the name of his father. That's no good. Which is why he needs to be voted out of office. He has to be voted out of office. Casey also voted against tax cuts, against Pennsylvania coal. He joined the left-wing mob by voting against Brett Kavanaugh. If you want to save American lives, and save American jobs, and keep things going like they're going now, which is better economically than any time in the history of our country... then you need to vote for a pro-American patriot, and he really is a patriot -- he loves this country -- named Lou Barletta.
Get out and vote please. [Audience Calls Out Lou] Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats support a socialist takeover of health care that would totally obliterate Medicare. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and who have paid for it all their lives.
And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We're going to protect people that need help, people with pre-existing conditions. If you want security for your family, for yourself, if you want to continue our great economic boom like we've never seen before, but it's all very fragile, it can end, they want to end it, then you must go out and vote Republican.
We need those votes in D.C. Since the election, as Lou has said, we've created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million people off of food stamps. We've added almost 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. They were supposed to be gone forever. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in history.
History. That's in history. Think of that. In history. It's got its best level on unemployment. Think of that. African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded in poverty. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment has always reached historic lows, lowest in history. And as I always say -- I'm sure you've heard it, I hate to say it again because I know the number is going to be changing very soon, it's going to be even better, women's unemployment has just fallen to 3.6 percent, which is only the lowest rate in 65 years.
I'm sorry. I keep saying it. I keep waiting for that number. I'm sorry, I'd like to apologize to the women, please. Sixty-five years, best in 65 years. I keep waiting for the new number to come out, because that will be history, too, just like African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American. Women, it's only the best number in 65 years.
I'd like to apologize. But it's very true. Women. Women for Trump. Women for Trump. Remember how badly I was going to do with women? I said, am I so bad? Remember how badly? And then I got 52 percent of the vote! And everybody said he beat crooked Hillary. What happened? What -- remember that? Remember they put up these phony numbers?
But you remember that? We did very well. Thank you to the women. We did very well. She never got it. The truth is she never got it. And she still doesn't get it. She's going around on a tour. Did you know this? Did you know that? I said, you should have saved it for the election. After years of being let down by Washington politicians, you now have a champion fighting for you in the White House.
But I need your help this Election Day, November 6th, to stop the radical Democrat mob from trying to take it away. And they're going to try and take it away. They're going to try and take it away. I need you to show up at the polls to continue this incredible movement, like the country has never seen before, like probably very few countries, frankly, have ever seen before.
The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. Then you should vote Democrat. For many years, our country was being pillaged and plundered by unfair trade deals. Pennsylvania lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs -- you know it well -- I spent lots of time with you folks up here. You know it well -- following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance, pushed by us, into the WTO, World Trade Organization, perhaps the only deal worse than NAFTA.
We got 'em both. They were both beauties, weren't they? But the era of economic surrender is over. America is not being taken advantage of any more. Sorry. America is respected again. America is respected again. Last week, I announced that we are replacing NAFTA with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement called USMCA.
I didn't want to use the word NAFTA. To create jobs that boost incomes, Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We've taken historic action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. Did you see -- did you see four weeks ago when Pfizer and Novartis and other drug companies raised the prices of their drugs very, very substantially?
And I didn't like it. And I called them. I said, you can't do that. You can't do that. And the first time -- and I give them credit. And I really thank them, too, honestly. But first time in history, they rescinded their price increase and they kept it the same, and they promised no increase for a substantial time.
But we're going to get them down. And when I called them up and they agreed to immediately rescind, perhaps that's the first time I realized how powerful it is to be the president of the United States. That was pretty -- that was pretty good. But I give them a lot of credit, and I appreciate it. We're going to get the prescription prices down, though.
We just signed new legislation today, and there's more coming, because you are being ripped off. You know, for the same pill, for the same drug, for the same company that makes it, the same package, you go to other countries, and you'll pay half and you'll pay less than half. It's a rigged system. You remember what else I called rigged?
I call plenty of things in this country rigged, but we're straightening it out. But it was a rigged system. Plenty of things rigged. And to help critically ill patients access life-saving treatments, we passed something called right to try. People that are terminally ill were given no chance, no hope. We have incredible drugs in the pipeline that can cure really horrible, horrific disease.
We wouldn't let anyone use these drugs because they didn't want to hurt them, but they're going to die. They're terminally ill! I said, what are we doing? And two months ago, I signed right to try. Somebody's terminally ill, we can try. And we've had great success. We've had great success. And by the way, in all fairness, you also find out whether or not it works.
Not so bad. Right to try. You know what it did? These people, if they had money, they'd travel all over the world looking for a cure. If they didn't have money, they'd go home. There was nothing -- they had no hope. No -- they had no hope. Now they have great hope. We make the greatest products in the world.
We make the greatest medicine, and we'd have hope. And some incredible things have already happened with right to try. They've been trying to pass it for 40 years. We got it passed, and that's because of your congressmen. That's because of your congressmen. That are with us tonight. We also passed veterans' choice.
Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor. Right? Our veterans. Forty-four years, they tried to pass it. When I first heard about it, I mean, it's not like I was studying it for my whole life. But I heard about it three-and-a-half years ago. I said, I have an idea. Let's -- when they wait on line for 10 days, 22 days, 38 days, you have to see, months and months, why don't we let them go see a private doctor and we paid the bill?
It will solve our problem. And I told everybody: I am the most brilliant guy in the world. Who else would think -- who else would think of that? So I go back to my people. I say, listen, I have this great idea. We can get these great vets to see the doctors. It's taken -- like 10 days was good. But some of them were ill, but not terribly ill.
It took them so long, they would literally become terminally ill. It took them weeks and weeks to see a doctor. So I went to my people and I said, what an idea this is! They said, actually, sir, we've been trying to get that idea passed for 44 years. I'm good at getting things passed. We signed it three months ago.
For our vets. And the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our great veterans can be held accountable. In other words, they're immediately fired. Not easy to get passed. They've been trying that one for about 46 years. We got that one passed, too. You think that was easy, getting that by -- I know you have a lot of union guys here.
But do you think that was easy getting that by the unions? Do you think that was easy getting that passed by civil service? Not too easy. We got it passed. Somebody does something bad to our veterans, we fire them on the spot. And we secured $716 billion to fully rebuild the American military. And we gave our great warriors their largest pay raise in almost a decade.
At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force. Very important. It's where it's at. That's where it's going. We want to always be the best. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. And I've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
Many, many presidents talked about they were going to do it, and they never had whatever it takes to do it. [Laughter] And I understand why, because there was a lot of pressure on that one. There were a lot of forces saying don't do it. I say, excuse me, get lost. But we did it. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America.
Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Pennsylvania. We are standing proudly for our national anthem. I need you to get your friends, get your families, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote Republican. Vote for Lou.
Vote for Mike. Vote for all of these great people here. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products made right here in the USA. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is the vote for safety, opportunity, prosperity, and justice.
It is not up to the media or the pundits to decide your fate. It is up to you. It is up to the people of Pennsylvania. It is up to the people of our country. You have the power with your vote to defend your family, your country, your values, your faith, and, indeed, to defend your dignity. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power back to the American people where it belongs.
Pennsylvania is the state that rang the Liberty Bell, forged the railroads, and put steel into the spine of our country. Generations of Pennsylvania workers manned the furnaces, farmed the fields, and fought the battles that made America into the most powerful and prosperous nation in the history of the world.
Unfortunately, years ago, they lost their way, but we have gotten that way back. These courageous Pennsylvania patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our great and proud American heritage. For the sake of freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win.
We will not bend, we will not break. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, and we will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
And always remember, together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you.
Evansville, you are very, very special people, and thank you, Indiana. Thank you. Thank you. We had great success in Indiana, as you know. It was an incredible experience. And we really honor you very, very special people. Thank you very much. Thank you.
And I know you well. You love our country. You're proud of our history. And you always respect our great American flag. [Audience Chants USA]
This is a really incredible time for your country. This is a truly amazing period of time. We have the best economy in the history of our country. Factories are reopening. Jobs are pouring back into the United States. We are putting your great Indiana coal miners and steelworkers back to work.
We're reclaiming our nation's proud manufacturing heritage and putting tariffs on foreign producers who cheat our workers and cheat our companies. Not fair. Not fair. [Audience Boos]
As President McKinley once said a long time ago, we believe in American work for American workers, American wages for American laborers, and American homes for American citizens.
Just this week, we made another truly historic announcement. We are replacing NAFTA with a beautiful, brand-new U.S.-Mexico trade deal.
And as we speak, Canada -- and we love Canada, right? But they have to get rid of those barriers and they have to get rid of those big tariffs. Canada showed up at the White House. Where the hell did she come from? [Audience Boos]
And now tomorrow -- that's one person. And now tomorrow you're going to read headlines, "Trump had protesters all over the place." One person. One person.
Major protests. But are they going to talk about the thousands and thousands of people inside of this arena and outside of the arena, where we put screens? No.
Because things are happening. Let me tell you just really quickly about something that did happen. So last week, you probably saw it, because it gets ratings, they put it on television, right? If it didn't get ratings, they wouldn't be putting it on.
But last week, you saw it, I was in the great state of West Virginia. We were in a fantastic arena, beautiful, smaller than this, but a very great place. We had crowds that were incredible. And the enthusiasm, I hate to tell you, the enthusiasm that you have tonight, in West Virginia, it was exactly the same. Can't get any more, right?
And the failing New York Times, which, by the way, if I wasn't here, those -- they would be out of business, the Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN. [Audience Boos]
So a writer for the New York Times that pretends she knows what she's talking about -- hasn't got a clue -- and I'm telling you, the enthusiasm was the same. The place was packed. She made the statement that President Trump was disappointed to see some empty chairs. Yeah, they were going to the bathroom, maybe. [Laughter]
And -- and -- and, listen -- and he was so disappointed at the tone in the room. We left this thing -- that was amazing. These are just dishonest, terrible people. I'm telling you that. Terrible people. [Audience Boos] Not all of them. Honestly, not all of them. I'd say 85 percent. [Laughter]
So we made a great deal with Mexico. And as you know, Canada didn't want to do what we have to have done. And after the deal was made with Mexico, Canada came along, and they're negotiating right now at the White House, at our territory.
And it could happen. We'll see what happens. And if it doesn't happen, we'll put tariffs on the cars coming in from Canada, and that'll be even better. So...
But I think it's going to happen. And we've really developed a very good relationship. Look, we love Canada. But they have to treat us fairly. They haven't treated us fairly. Right?
I'll give you an example with Canada. Dairy products, they put tariffs on our dairy products going into Canada, almost 300 percent. We can't have that. Can't have that. [Audience Boos]
And a lot of other barriers where we can't sell. So we'll open it up or we'll be -- frankly, maybe even better. Either way, it's going to work beautifully, OK? That I promise. Because I'll tell you what, this country is tired of being ripped off by other countries.
Tired of it. And we're doing some great deals with other countries, also. You've been reading about it. And they're getting done one by one. And if they don't get done, we come out almost better. So that's the way it is.
But we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many of your state's great Republican leaders. And I have to say, I have to say, a man who followed a very hard act, our great vice president, Mike Pence.
But a man who followed my -- that's a hard act, because Mike did a great job as your governor and he's doing a great job for us now in Washington. And you have a governor, Eric Holcomb, who is doing a fantastic job. Fantastic.
Thank you very much, Eric. Thank you. Great job. And, Mrs. Holcomb, thank you very much. It's a great team. Great team.
People that have really helped me in Washington -- you know, we did a lot of things, including cutting your taxes, the biggest tax decrease ever.
Congressman Larry Bucshon and Congressman Todd Rokita, thank you. Thank you, Larry and Todd. Thank you. Also, a very special Indiana cheer, Kyle Hupfer. Kyle, thank you. Great job. Kyle -- how are we doing in Indiana, Kyle? They're going to beat Joe Donnelly.
Going to beat Joe Donnelly. You're going to beat Joe Donnelly. You have to, because we need the votes. We need the votes. You're not going to get -- Joe is not going to vote for us on anything. He's maybe going to vote for a great judge right now.
But before we talk about that, I want to bring a person up to the stage who's really done an incredible job. He went through a primary with a couple of real pros. And I have to say, they have been so fantastic. You did so well. So well. And we appreciate it, man. You know what I'm talking about. You know. Incredible.
Incredible. But he went through, he did great, people loved him. He's been a very, very successful businessman, which is really what our country needs. I mean, a lot of this is business, and it's common sense.
And I just saw a poll just a little while ago, a real poll -- you know, they have fake polls. They do suppression polls. You know what a fake poll is. It's called a suppression. They make you think you can't win, so you go to see a movie. Don't go to see a movie. Remember me? They said, I don't know, it's going to be impossible for Donald Trump to get 270. We can't envision it.
It's impossible. Remember the lines from NBC? Which is probably worse than CNN. But the word is they're firing the head of NBC. What a great thing to do. How smart. That's what the word. Who knows? With these people, you never know.
But, by the way, take a look, Todd, everybody, Governor, look how many cameras you have back there. Is this -- like the Academy Awards. Look at it. [Laughter]
They can't get enough. But when I start screaming fake news, you see those red lights go off for a little while. You know, excuse me, we have technical difficulties, OK, then they go back. Right? Look at this. [Audience Boos]
You know, in the studio, you hear, they go, listen, he's about ready to go. Look, ladies and gentlemen, we have technical difficulties, we'll be back in just about -- then he goes back. OK, we're back, here we go, keep going.
Oh, what they have to put up with. You know, it's not that easy for them, either. It's tough to have a network where you're calling them fake news and they're supposed to be proud. That just shows when you get good ratings, you can say anything. Right? That's what happens. Get good ratings.
Finally, I just want to get Mike Braun up here, because he has been special. He's a special man. And he is going to be a truly great senator. Mike, please.
Never a dull moment in this pursuit, is it? You know, I love what the president said, is when somebody says you can't do something, for some of us, it causes us to even work harder. When I watched this man clear the field back in 2016, when they said it could never be done...
And there was not one person on that stage that could have beaten Hillary Clinton other than this man here. [Audience Chants Lock Her Up] And the other thing you need to know is politicians too often say something and they never follow up on it. This man makes promises and keeps them.
And he needs a true ally, not somebody that says something when you're in Indiana and does something differently when you're in D.C.
Joe Donnelly voted against tax reform. [Audience Boos] Yes. As a congressman, he voted for Obamacare. [Audience Boos] And then, when he could have had the deciding vote, he voted against repealing it. [Audience Boos] He voted for the Iranian deal. And thank goodness we undid that. [Audience Boos]
It's a sad story. He promised to drain the swamp. And I want to be an ally. When I get there, you can count on it that I'm going there for the right reasons.
I'm not going there for the pay or the perks or the pensions that they get, like none of the rest of us do. I'm going there to make this man have an ally there that you can count on every time.
So get your friends, get your neighbors out. I'm going to need the help to take it across the finish line, because Joe's got to go. Joe's got to go. Joe's got to go. Joe's got to go. [Audience Chants Joe's Got to Go] Thank you all. See you.
He'll be a great senator. A vote for Mike Braun is a vote to -- did you ever hear this before -- make America great again? And you know our new slogan that we'll be switching to because we're way ahead of schedule as to make America great again, right? It's called keep America great, exclamation point. Keep America great.
That's what's happening. We're so far ahead of schedule. People come up to me all the time and they go, "Thank you, Mr. President." Just backstage right now. People. "Thank you, Mr. President, for saving our country. Our country was in serious trouble."
And when you hear them trying to take credit for what we, you, me, all of us together, what we've done, if we didn't come along, you would have had, instead of 4.2%, you know, it was raised yesterday from 4.1%...
You would have been in negative numbers. The country was choking with regulations, choking with high taxes. You would have been in negative numbers. And that's what was happening. You would have seen some real mess.
And what we've done, all together, because this is one of the great revolutions -- you can call it a revolution, if you like -- that's ever taken place in our country. And we want to keep it going. A vote for Mike's opponent, sleepy Joe, is a vote for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi... [Audience Boos] And who else? Maxine Waters. [Audience Boos]
You know, I gave Mike, a little while ago, something that I saw -- but he's seen it -- the Indianapolis Star did a story, and I guess it's a poll of some kind. Joe Donnelly rated least effective Democrat in Senate in a new study.
It says, who is the least effective Democrat in the United States Senate? Senator Joe Donnelly, according to the Center for Effective Lawmaking, who said the Democrat from Indiana was the worst. According to the center, Donnelly introduced two bills in the 114th Congress for 2015-2016 that received some kind of action in committee, the fewest among his 44 Democratic colleagues, and neither of them advanced to the floor for a vote. [Audience Boos]
Now, this wasn't an anomaly, it says. The center just said this, this wasn't just a one-time, one-year, unusual thing or anomaly. It ranked Donnelly 55 out of 57. Oh, I see. He did much better. Among Democrats in the 113th Congress.
So I have to tell you that, if that's what you want representing Indiana, you can have it. You can have it. [Audience Boos]
You can -- I mean, hey -- Joe Donnelly voted no on tax cuts. He voted no on Obamacare. We had Obamacare done, if he would have raised his hand, repeal and replace. He voted no on repeal and replace of Obamacare. But we did get rid of the individual mandate, and we brought it down, and it's going. It's leaving fast. It's leaving fast.
Joe Donnelly voted against enhanced vetting for refugees. Let them come in. Open up those borders. Open them up. [Audience Boos]
He says open up those borders, let them in. He voted against stopping illegal immigrants from getting welfare. And Donnelly repeated voting for amnesty. He wants amnesty. Donnelly also voted for liberal Obama judges who want to take away your Second Amendment and lots of other things. [Audience Boos]
We need to elect senators who will vote for judges who follow our laws of our Constitution as written. Like Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, who's doing a great job, and Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who we're trying to get through right now.
In this election, you aren't just voting for a candidate. You're voting for which party controls Congress. Very, very big vote. It's very close. People say we have the majority. By how much? Like, by almost nothing. Somebody has a cold, we no longer have the majority. We need Republicans in Congress.
Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by left-wing haters, angry mobs, deep state radicals, establishment cronies, and their fake news allies. [Audience Boos]
Our biggest obstacle and their greatest ally actually is the media. You can believe it. We've got stories that are so big and the media doesn't pick them up. We have stories that if that was about a Republican or a conservative, it'd be front page of every newspaper. And we have them and they just don't want to write them. It's a dishonest group of people, I will tell you that. [Audience Boos]
You can have the biggest story about Hillary Clinton -- I mean, look at what she's getting away with. But let's see if she gets away with it. Let's see. [Audience Chants Lock Her Up]
All I can say is, our Justice Department and our FBI -- at the top of each, because inside, they have incredible people -- but our Justice Department and our FBI have to start doing their job right and doing it right and doing it now.
Because people are angry. People are angry. What's happening is a disgrace. And at some point -- I wanted to stay out. But at some point, if it doesn't straighten out properly -- I want them to do their job -- I will get involved, and I'll get in there, if I have to.
Disgraceful. And the whole world is watching. And the whole world gets it. And the whole world understands exactly what's going on.
The Democrats, they call themselves the resistance. That's what they're good at, resisting and obstructing. They are obstructionists. Every day, they are resisting the will of the American people and trying to undermine the verdict of our democracy, delivered so strongly in 2016, like never before delivered.
The most remarkable thing about the modern Democrat Party is how truly undemocratic they really have become, right?
The so-called resistance is mad because their ideas have been rejected by the American people. And we're really -- we're getting rid of those bad ideas one by one, so fast. And it is driving them crazy.
They're the old and corrupt, globalist, ruling class that squandered trillions of dollars on foreign adventures. They don't want to build the wall here, although we've started, but it's not easy. But they'll build walls in other countries. They'll create borders in other lands so far away. But over here, let everybody pour in and we don't worry about the crime. It's a disgrace. [Audience Boos]
They've made the worst trade deals in the history of the world, and who enriched themselves while presiding over the destruction of American jobs, American companies, and American wealth? It was the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. What we did to our companies and to our jobs, we should be ashamed of our leadership, but not this leadership. Because we're bringing them back.
When we pledged to work over corruption in Washington, these are the people we're talking about. So in this election, we can't let up. We're going to -- and it's happening fast. We're going to drain the swamp.
We've replaced failed Democrat lawmakers with America first Republicans. And it's happening. We want people like Mike Braun. Republicans stand for stopping illegal immigration...
...fixing bad, horrible, obsolete trade deals, unleashing American energy, cutting taxes, supporting our militaries and our great vets, our great, great vets... [Audience Chants USA]
Republicans stand for protecting Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and strengthening the safety net for truly needy Americans, not for illegal aliens and people that come into our country to take advantage of us.
Democrats want to raise your taxes. We want to lower your taxes. By the way, that doesn't sound like a great campaign theme, "We're going got raise your taxes. We're going to fire ICE." I don't think that works too well. They want to raise your taxes.
We want to take away your regulations. They want to increase your regulations. They want to weaken our military. They don't want to give us -- we're always fighting money. We want money for our military. They want money for things that you wouldn't believe. They want to shut down your coal mines. [Audience Boos] That's not happening. By the way, you're up, like, 60 percent. You're doing all right.
I've had such an incredible experience with the miners. And just a little while ago, backstage, there were nine -- of the nine -- now, these were tough guys. These are really -- these are seriously tough cookies. In fact, I looked at them and I said I wouldn't want to fight these guys. [Laughter]
But of the nine, eight of them were crying. And I looked at the ninth, crying out of happiness, because they're back. I looked at the ninth guy, I said, what's wrong with you? Why aren't you crying? "I don't cry, sir." I said, that's OK. [Laughter] That's OK. Eight out of nine were crying with happiness. And they want to raid Medicare to pay for socialism. [Audience Boos]
Somehow, I don't see Indiana being the next Venezuela, I just don't see it, right? We don't see it. That's what would happen, too. At the center of this election is the issue of border security, so important. We've now started the wall in San Diego, and we're doing another ninety. It's like pulling teeth to get the money from these Democrats.
We got $1.6 billion, then we just got another $1.6 billion. Now we're asking for a lot more. We can do that thing so quickly. But they really want -- I mean, honestly, they want -- even though, in 2006, almost all of them voted in favor of, essentially, a wall, OK? Now they think it's politically expedient to anything Trump wants, please go against. Please.
Because they are not liking my poll numbers even a little bit. And within the Republican Party -- I have to say this, because this is very cool -- within the Republican Party, the highest poll numbers -- I think it's -- well, they have 90 percent, they have 92 percent, and they have 93 percent. The highest poll numbers ever. Ever. Is that crazy?
I actually asked them, I said, did they do polling when Honest Abe Lincoln was around? You know what? Nobody's been able to give me that answer, but I'm assuming they did, OK? So we can say we're beating Honest Abe.
Democrats want to open borders, which really equals allowing into our country massive amounts of crime. Republicans want strong borders, we want no crime, we want great law enforcement. And by the way, we love our law enforcement.
If you want to summarize the difference between Democrats and Republicans, just remember this. Democrats want to abolish ICE. Where did this come from? [Audience Boos]
By the way, do you have any idea what ICE does? I don't think anybody in this room, unless they're really tough, and I know a couple of people right here are probably tough enough. I don't think so, though, actually. I know them too well. Actually, I know their weaknesses, so I think they're not.
But these are people that go into a nest of MS-13. They call it a nest. That's where it is. It's a nest. These are evil people in there. These -- this is a group of gang members -- I can't say "animals" anymore because Nancy Pelosi got very angry when I called them animals. I called them animals. She went crazy. I can't do it.
I can't call them animals. Even though they have guns, but they don't like using guns because it's not painful enough. They want to slice people up, young girls walking home from school, 16 years old. And they slice [Inaudible] they died. They died. Their parents are incredible people. I met their parents. Devastated.
And the reason was because it was more painful. And then I call them animals, and Nancy Pelosi gets upset because I'm talking about "human beings." They don't get it. They don't get it. [Audience Boos]
So we want to abolish MS-13. They want to abolish ICE. And I have to tell you about MS-13. You know, we have towns in Long Island -- I grew up in that area generally -- I know every one of those towns. They were always great. They were safe. You'd leave your door open at night. You never locked your door. You leave your windows open, no problem.
Now they're infested with MS-13. But we're getting them the hell out so fast. Don't worry about it. They're -- they're going. We're doing a great job.
We're doing a great job. And we have really no laws to work with. We have really no laws to work with. The laws are horrible. Laws are the worst and dumbest in the history of the world. Again, between the trade deals, world, and our immigration horrible laws in the world, but we're getting them out.
But you know what? ICE, we call ICE, and they go into those towns, and they grab those guys by the neck and they throw them into those paddy wagons. They couldn't care less. And you don't want to do it. And you don't want to do it.
But we have some really bad people that were allowed into this country under President Obama and others. And we're getting them the hell out. [Audience Boos]
And, you know, these towns that I know so well, we get ICE out there, and the people are standing at their windows cheering. They're like clapping for ICE. They're clapping because these are brave people, they're good people, too, good heart. But they're tough. They're tough. They're strong and they're tough.
And ICE is afraid of them. You know why? Because they're much tougher than ICE. And that's what happens to work. I hate to say it. So they get out -- and you know the sad thing -- it's sad, actually -- it's like the towns are being liberated, like it's a war. And you're getting finally the enemy out of our country. The towns are being liberated from this scum. Amazing.
Amazing. So the Democrats want to abolish ICE, and the Republicans want to cherish ICE. And I can tell you that. And I think everybody in this room respects and really admires Border Patrol, ICE, all of our law enforcement, everybody. Not an easy job.
Not an easy job. A vote for Democrats in November is a vote to erase our borders and leave innocent Americans at the mercy of hardened criminals. That's what will happen. We need strong law and order.
A vote for Republicans is a vote to support the brave heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, law enforcement, and all of the other groups that work with us.
Every day, ICE, which is being so badly treated -- that's why -- I'll sometimes go more and more in favor of talking about ICE, because what the Democrats are doing to the morale of these brave people is incredible. It's incredible. And you know what? If they didn't have them, they'd be calling up begging, saying, where is the -- we need ICE. We need somebody to help. This election is about safety. And this election is about jobs.
And the beauty of the jobs, people that were stock in one job, didn't like it, they've now got six different alternatives. They go here. They get one that they like. And they're making more money. Wages are going up. Nobody thought this was going to happen. Excuse me, you ready? 3.8 percent. Isn't that nice? Nobody thought that was going to happen.
Thanks to Republican leadership, our economy is booming like never before. It's never been like this. Economic growth last quarter hit a number that nobody thought possible. This number was one, less than one, and going down to negative, negative territory.
We've created nearly 4 million new jobs since the election and lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. We've added almost 500,000 new manufacturing jobs since election, 500,000.
And if I would have come here -- and I did come to Indiana a lot -- and you know who I brought with me? Who did I bring? The great Bobby Knight.
What a coach. You know that story with Bobby, right? A year before I was going to run, Bobby Knight called. And they say, sir, do you know a Bobby Knight? I said, you mean the coach? This is before I ran. And I said, you're talking about the coach? My secretary, great person, said, yes, sir, I think he said he was a coach.
I pick up. I said hello. He goes, "Trump, this is Bobby Knight, and you got to run for president. Our country needs you." And I said that's Bobby Knight. That's Bobby Knight. Right? That's Bobby Knight.
After the first word, I knew it was Bobby Knight. And he said, you got to run. I said, well, you know, Bobby, first of all, I respect you a lot and I really love winners and you are a winner. And the job you did -- great guy. He's also a great guy. Big heart. He doesn't want people to know that, but he's actually got a very big heart. He'd be devastated if I said that he has a big -- but he does. He has a big heart.
But I said, you know, Bobby, I haven't decided to run. But if I do, could you give me your number? I'll take it, and I'll call you. So an amazing thing happened. So I write down his number. It was a cell. I wrote it down, and I put -- I have a stack of papers on my desk in New York. I haven't been there -- I haven't been to that office because I don't care about any of that stuff anymore. I only care about doing what's good for us. I couldn't care less. It's true.
They won't tell you that, but it's true. So I take this number, and I put it on my desk, and I put it in the middle of a stack of papers. I just -- you know, it's like sort of a file, some of you people might have some -- it's like a file of things you may need someday but probably not. And then when you go through them about three years later, 95 percent of it, you throw out, right?
But I had two big stacks -- you'll see pictures of me in the office, you'll see these massive stacks. I just have them. And now I say, I'm going to run. And we did great. We were on center stage of every single debate, right? Every single debate.
Center stage means we were never in second place. And if we were, they would let you know about it tomorrow morning. [Laughter] We were never in second. I was center stage on every -- well, however many debates.
Anyway, I'm doing well. We won New York. We won this one. We won that one. We won New Hampshire. Wow, New Hampshire was so great. We won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. We won everything, right? And then they said -- even though we were so far -- in all fairness, I have to say this, we were really so far ahead that I think that even Indiana wasn't going to have too much of an effect, but I want to win Indiana.
So a friend of mine, he's from Indiana, great guy. I said, how am I doing in Indiana? He says great. I said, good. I said, what can I do to ensure it? Well, if you could get, like, Bobby Knight to endorse you, that would end Indiana.
I said, you know, it's funny that you mention that, but he called me a year ago wanting me to run. He said the country needs it. And I said -- and I put his number right here. I was at my desk. I put this number right here. And true. True. I bet you I have 2,000 pages of stuff, more. And I said -- I put it right here. And I lifted up the stack, like in the middle, I lifted it up, and there's a little card that says Bobby Knight with a number. It was the weirdest thing.
Right? Crazy. I said, here's his number. The guy actually looked at me, and he goes, that's amazing. And I dialed in front of him. I dialed the number.
And Bobby Knight didn't even ask who was on the phone. I guess he sees New York and he sees maybe Trump Organization or -- he goes, I've been waiting for you to call. [Laughter]
Right? And I'll tell you what. Bobby Knight -- was anybody here the night I traveled in with Bobby Knight when we -- right?
I never saw anything like that in my life. We were in this massive arena. We walked in, and I introduced Bobby Knight. And I'm telling you, the people of Indiana, they went crazy. That thing never stopped. That was incredible.
And, Bobby Knight, and I called him -- and I said, you know, I thought about you today, because I'm going to Indiana, and I don't need you to come from where you are. I just wanted to say hello to Bobby Knight, because he was special, and he worked hard on our campaign. And he was very happy to get that call. Bobby Knight. Right?
We love winners. We love winners. Winners are winners. Bobby, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger. How about Tiger, the comeback he's -- right? Tiger. Did you say the fake news tried to fake out Tiger? They didn't do too well. Tiger's sharp.
No, we love winners. We love winners. Our country is becoming a winner, and our country is respected again. You see that.
We've created not millions, not billions, but trillions of dollars of wealth in just a short time since our election. Trillions.
And we're the talk of the world. I'll tell you, every foreign leader who comes to see me, almost, they walk in and they start off, Mr. President, congratulations on the incredible success you're having with your economy. Congratulations. Everything. Almost everyone.
And something I am very proud of, African-American unemployment recently achieved the lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country.
And we're fighting every day for African-Americans, for more jobs, for higher wages, for safer communities, for great schools, and we want school choice. We got to have. We're fighting hard. It's going to make a big difference. But African-Americans, the lowest unemployment in history.
Hispanic Americans and Asian-Americans, the unemployment have recently reached their lowest rates in the history of our country.
And I remember and you remember when I used to go -- and I'd go to a big arena like this, bigger. This is a pretty big one, I must say. Oh, by the way, if they write tomorrow, "The enthusiasm in the room was wanting," you know, they're like, "wanting." See, you have to understand, I have a better education than they do from a much better school, but -- the elite. They're the elite. They're the elite.
I went to better schools, I went to better everything. And by the way, by the way, are you ready for this? And I'm president, and they're not.
But it's us. It's us. It's a movement. It's a movement like this country -- and probably the world -- but like this country has ever seen. That's a big statement. But I make that statement -- I don't get corrected. And they would correct me in two seconds. I don't get -- this is a movement like this country has never seen before. I'll give you an example. If crooked Hillary Clinton had won... [Audience Boos]
... and she came to Indiana to have a rally for the opponent, who was rated the worst in the Senate, of Mike Braun, if you had 500 people -- seriously, if you had -- they won't tell you this -- but we don't have -- we have an election coming up. We don't have a presidential election coming up. You don't get big crowds.
If crooked Hillary came here, if she had 300 to 500 people -- first of all, she wouldn't be in this building. She'd be in a hotel conference room. It would be a conference room, right?
It would be a conference. And I'm not saying -- I'm just saying. I'm not saying it's -- I'm just saying, something incredible is happening with our country to have this. Something incredible.
Youth unemployment has just reached its lowest rate in nearly 50 years. That's a biggie. Unemployment -- this is so important -- unemployment for Americans without high school diplomas has reached the lowest rate ever recorded. Isn't that beautiful? Isn't that beautiful?
And prisoners, all right, prisoners were having a tremendously tough time from the beginning, because employers didn't want to hire them. And now the greatest thing we have is an incredible economy, where employers need people. And for the first time ever, really -- and we have a lot of great programs to help -- for the first time ever, employers are hiring prisoners. They're getting a second and, in some cases, a third chance.
And I have a friend who hired prisoners. I said, whoa, that's great. And he said, you wouldn't believe how great they are. They're better than my other people.
Now, he's got a couple of cases where he's not so happy, and that's the end of that. That's fine. But he said, these are incredible people. And I guarantee you, they're a lot of them in here for 25, 30 years. These are incredible people. They're getting a second chance, in a couple of cases, he told me, it was the third chance.
But it's unfair. They get out of prison, they made a mistake, they get out of prison, and nobody hires them, and they end up going back. They have -- I mean, they can't live, they can't eat, they can't anything. Now they get that second chance.
Can I tell you what? We're working hard on that in my administration, and that's one of the things we're really happy about. Really happy. Incredible to watch. And they're doing a great job.
All right, women. This is not good. So African-American historic, Asian-American, Hispanic American, all historic, right? Sorry, women, I let you down again. Women's unemployment rate recently reached only the lowest rate in 65 years. I let you down, I'm sorry.
What can I do? But I predict -- 65 years for women. Most of the rest are historic. The women -- I promise you, I think, I better say I think, within three or four weeks, you'll also be at historic levels, I think, 65 years. We'll say, 65 years is not good enough.
A big one that just came out, consumer confidence in our country is at an 18-year high. Isn't that beautiful? Big thing.
And a brand-new poll just shows that 85 percent of blue-collar workers -- I love blue-collar workers...
I actually like them better than white-collar workers, but probably I won't say it too loud. I love our blue-collar workers, and so do our white-collar workers.
But our blue-collar workers believe their lives are headed in the right direction, and the poll numbers are massive. We've increased exports of clean, beautiful coal, one of our great resources, that they wanted to close up by -- listen to this, by 60 percent in just this little short period of time, six-oh.
And thanks to our very strong trade policies where we don't allow other nations to rip us off and take advantage of us any longer. And if they do, we put tariffs on their products coming in. Sorry, folks. Steel Dynamics announced a $75 million investment in Columbia City and a $400 million investment in Terre Haute. And U.S. Steel announced a $750 million investment in Gary, Indiana.
U.S. Steel. And U.S. Steel is opening up at least seven plants, and they're going to be spending billions of dollars building new stuff. I'll tell you what, steel. We were dead. It was over. Now we're going to be using our mines, we're going to be using -- we're opening up -- we're like -- it's the hottest thing that's happening. Our steel industry -- because we're not allowing dumping. And if somebody wants to dump, like if China is going to dump or other countries are going to dump steel to hurt our companies and our workers, they're paying 25 percent tariffs on the stuff that they dump. Now they won't dump so much.
We're building a new steel industry. And it's an amazing thing to watch. Because America's winning again. And America is being respected again.
I'm proud to say that I was asked to help because they weren't getting any help. It wasn't going to happen with the previous administration. And we're bringing back the Summer Olympics in 2028, and we're bringing the World Cup in 2026 back to our nation.
Those are just the little things. By the way, the Olympics, the World Cup -- I mean, the big stuff, you know what that is. We passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. Indiana families are saving $5 billion on their taxes this year alone, $5 billion.
And I tell the people, the typical American family of four earning $75,000 will take home $2,000 at least extra this year, and many will take home really much more than that. A lot.
And one that people love because they said it would be impossible to do, our tax bill saves small businesses and family farms, ranches, and all of the other things associated with -- if you died, you pay a big tax and your children lose it. We have gotten rid of the estate tax, also known as the death tax.
Very important for this area, we are canceling President Obama's illegal anti-coal so-called clean power plan.
You know, there's an example. It's such a beautiful name, clean power. Clean power, right? They want to have windmills all over the place, right? When the wind doesn't blow, what do we do? Uh, we got problems. When there's thousands of birds laying at the base of the windmill, what do we do? Isn't that amazing? The environmentalists, "We like windmills." Oh, really? What about the thousands of birds they're killing? Try going to the bottom of a windmill someday. It's not a pretty picture.
But, really, when the wind doesn't blow, you got problems. If your house is staring at a windmill, not good. When you hear that noise going round and round and round, and you're living with it, and then you go crazy after a couple of years, not good. And the environmentalists say, oh, isn't it wonderful?
We've ended the war on clean coal. We've also repealed the individual mandate. It's gone. Last month, the FDA approved more affordable generic drugs than at any time ever in the history of our country.
And thanks to our effort, many drug companies are freezing or reversing planned price increases. You remember two weeks ago, Pfizer -- and I take my hat off to them -- I like them -- they increased their prices substantially of drugs. And I got angry about it. I think it's probably the first time I realized what great power we have here. I got angry.
Novartis, same thing. They increased their prices. I'm decreasing the prices. I got really angry about it. And they announced the following day that they're no longer going to increase the prices of their drugs. And those prices are going to come down.
Because we've put mechanisms in work -- lots of different -- I won't bore you with the complications -- it's actually -- we had middlemen that were so rich they were making a fortune on drugs, prescription drugs. We're getting rid of all of that. Drug prices are coming down like they've never seen. Increases are stopping, like with Pfizer and Novartis. And we're stopping hospitals from overcharging low-income seniors for these same prescription drugs.
We passed veterans choice. Our veterans are the greatest. You know, when I got involved, I said, that's a bad situation going over with the vets. They're really being treated badly. These are, really, our greatest people, as far as I'm concerned. And...
The vets would wait online to see a doctor six days, nine days, 21 days, 34 days. Some of them would have a minor condition. By the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill. And I said, we're not going to let that happen.
And I came up with an idea that I thought was brilliant. I said, you know what, we have all these doctors, some of them really good, talented doctors, surrounding and in the neighborhoods closer than where the vets are trying to get taken care of. We're going to let the vets go and see those doctors, and we're going to pay their bill, right?
And I said -- I said, this is so brilliant. And then I presented it to Congress, and the Congress went, yes, sir, we've been trying to pass this bill 45 years. So this is common sense, wouldn't you think? The problem is, they couldn't get it passed. We got it passed. It's called veterans choice. The veterans have a choice. They can go here or they go out to see a doctor. We pay the bill.
We also passed a landmark -- and this was just as tough, believe it or not -- V.A. accountability law, where people that work at the V.A. are now held accountable, so now if a government worker abuses one of our great veterans, we turn to them and we very toughly say, sorry, you're fired.
True. Very tough things to get passed. I guess I'm good at getting things passed, but it was great. We had great help by the Republicans, by the Republicans in Congress. We had virtually no help by the Democrats.
Very importantly, my administration is also standing up for the free speech rights of all Americans. Free speech rights.
Look at social media. It's a thing called free speech rights. You look at Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media giants. And I've made it clear that we, as a country, cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results. And you know, it can go the other way, also.
We will not let large corporations silence conservative voices. And it can, it can go the other way, too, someday. It can play little tricks with them. We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and learn from. We can't do that. America is a free country, and we are going to stay always a free country.
We're defending American values and we're also defending our great American interests all over the world. We've secured a record $700 billion for our military this year and $716 billion, another record, next year. We're rebuilding our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before.
And on my direction, the Pentagon is working to create a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces. It's called Space Force. So important. So important. I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal.
And if you look at what's happening to Iran, they are not too happy. You know, when I came into office, Iran was like this big power, big power. And there was just a question of when are they going to take over the whole Middle East. They're going into Iraq. They're going into Syria. They're in Yemen. They were looking at the Mediterranean, far away. They were going to take it all over.
And I said, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to terminate this stupid deal made by the previous administration.
And I can tell you one thing. Iran is not looking at the Mediterranean any longer. And hopefully that will all work out between us and Iran. But they have to live by a certain set of rules. That was a terrible, terrible deal. Remember, they were given $150 billion. And then they were given $1.8 billion -- what does that look like -- in cash, $1.8 billion. Hard to believe. You remember that. I also recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
Because instead of apologizing for America, we are standing tall for America, the country that we love. We are standing up for the heroes who protect America. We are proudly standing up for our national anthem.
But if Democrats get back into power, they will try to reverse all of the incredible gains that we've made, including very substantially increasing your taxes. [Audience Boos]
If you want more jobs, more safety, and more opportunity, then you need to get your friends, get your family, get your co-workers, and get out and vote Republican and vote over here for a great gentleman named Mike Braun.
You got to vote for Mike Braun. Local citizens. You love your state. You love your country. You're loyal. You helped build this country. Together, we're taking back our country, returning power to where it belongs. We're returning power to the American people. That's what we're doing.
From Bloomington to Madison and from South Bend to right here in beautiful Evansville, this great state was built by patriots and pioneers, mechanics and ministers and farmers and factory workers.
With American hands and American grit, your ancestors built a home for themselves and for their beautiful families. They were tough, and they were strong, and they were smart. They were proud Americans, and together they turned Indiana into a powerhouse of American people and American ingenuity.
What they've done in this great place. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they love their families, they love their country, and they loved their God.
We stand on the shoulders of generations of American patriots who knew how to work, knew how to fight -- oh, do you know how to fight, fight, fight -- and you knew how to win. Just like them, we're going to keep on fighting, we're going to keep on winning, we are going to win for our nation, our children, our families, for our freedom.
We will never give up. We will never give in. We will never back down. And we will fight on to victory. We will only have victory, because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue.
We're going to win so much that you're going to be begging me, please, please, Mr. President, the people of Indiana cannot continue to win like this. We're not used to this. This is terrible. And you're going to ask your senator, Mike Braun, or your great governor, or maybe both of them together, please, please go see the president. We can't stand winning anymore.
And they're going to come see me in the Oval Office, and they're going to say, Mr. President, the people of Indiana have been winning too much under your leadership. Honestly, sir, they can't stand it anymore. And I'm going to look back at them, and I'm going to say, I don't give a damn what they want. We're going to keep on winning. Right?
We're going to keep on winning. We're one people. We're one family. We're one glorious nation under God, and together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Indiana. Thank you. Mike Braun. Thank you.
Wow. Oh, hello, Fargo. Hi, Fargo. We love you, Fargo. What a place. What a place. Thank you very much. This is an honor. You know, I wish we could have had this stage back about 100 yards. You'd see how many people. This place is packed.
This place is packed. The only thing more packed is outside, trying to get in. They're having a hard time. They can't get in. It's full. You know, we had the chance for a 24,000-seat arena. And we should have taken it.
The problem is, if we had two empty seats, we didn't quite get there, which will always happen, they will say, "He didn't fill up the arena. He didn't fill it up." Right. That's what they'll say. "He didn't fill that arena up." Twenty-four thousand seats. No, we would have filled it up very easily, in retrospect, but that's OK. Thank you very much.
I am thrilled to be here in the great state of North Dakota with so many hard-working American patriots. Right? And I want to congratulate -- right? We want to do this. You know what I'm going to say. I want to congratulate the North Dakota State Bison.
I shouldn't tell you this. I shouldn't tell you this, but when I was coming out, they were talking about Bison. I said, "I thought there was an s." They said, "It is. But it's pronounced Bizon." So, we didn't want to get that wrong, right? But that is some -- that is some great national championship team. That's a great group of winners.
Winners. We're honored to be joined by many of your wonderful North Dakota leaders. Your governor, and a great guy, Doug Burgum, and his wife, First Lady of North Dakota, Kathryn Burgum. Where are you, Governor? Where are you? Thank you, Governor. Your former governor, Ed Schafer. Ed.
Nice guy. A friend of mine, who employs a lot of people, a very successful guy. He puts a straw in the ground and oil comes out. These big companies, they go out, they spend billions looking for oil. They don't find anything. Harold Hamm. Where's Harold? Where is Harold? If I ever want to find oil, I'm going to call Harold. Here's a straw, Harold. North Dakota Republican Party Chairman, great guy, really helpful, Rick Berg.
Thank you, Rick. A man who is so incredibly helpful, to me and to you, and to everybody. A special person who works so hard. I call him all-action, no-talk, that's -- don't we like that? All-action... Senator John Hoeven. He is fantastic.
And I also want to thank Kelly Armstrong, who's running for Congress. He's going to win. And Kelly, thank you very much. Thank you. Good guy. We also have a couple of big supporters. Do you ever see this guy with the pillows on Fox? John? MyPillow guy. Mike Liddell. Where is Mike?
He is the greatest. I have never seen so many ads for so long. And you know what? I think he gets them for, like, peanuts. First of all, he does make a great product. Great pillows. I actually use them, believe it or not.
But he's been -- he's been a supporter from day one. And I said, "You know, I want you to be my ad buyer." Because I guarantee you, he makes great deals. So, I haven't asked him yet. Will you be my ad buyer, please, Mike?
The MyPillow guy. Thank you. And he's been with us right from the beginning. Along with a lot of other folks, actually. We've had a great journey together, and we are making progress like nobody thought possible.
Finally, the person we are all here tonight to support, a special person, an incredible person, the next United States Senator from the great state of North Dakota, Kevin Cramer. Kevin, come out. Good guy.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. All I can say is, Mr. President, on behalf of all of the thousands of people in this arena, and the tens of thousands outside of this arena, who live in flyover country, thank you for not forgetting us.
And for all the farmers, and the manufacturers, and the families, and the energy workers, thank you for rolling back all of those regulations so they can not only keep their jobs but create more jobs.
And, Mr. President, on behalf of the middle-class working families represented in this room and throughout the heartland, thank you for cutting their taxes, so they can keep more of their hard-earned money right here.
And, Mr. President, on behalf of the most vulnerable forgotten people, the unborn babies, thank you for standing for life. Thank you.
And on these very important North Dakota values, you'll never have to wonder where I'll be, because I'll always be with them and with you, 100 percent of the time. Thank you. God bless you. Welcome to North Dakota.
USA! USA! USA!
I have got to tell you, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. He did good. He loves you. I will tell you that. He loves this state, loves the people. And we need Kevin Cramer to replace liberal Democrat Heidi Heitkamp in the Senate. Going to happen. It's going to happen.
When Heidi ran for office, she promised to be an independent vote for the people of North Dakota. Instead, she went to Washington and immediately joined Chuck. You know who Chuck is. And Nancy. And now they have a new leader. Who's the new leader?
[Inaudible]
Maxine Waters is their new leader. [Booing]
Maxine Waters. I think she's taking over. You know, they say, took. I never believed I was taking over the Republican Party. They say that to cause problems. But Maxine Waters is taking over the Democrat Party, so.
Heidi voted no on the Obamacare repeal. And, by the way, it was done. It was done. Unfortunately, she wouldn't vote. And another person didn't vote. We had it done.
Another person campaigned for eight years. "Repeal and replace." And we were a little surprised when the thumb went down. But we're doing very well. You see what's happening. We're coming up with incredible plans. We've gotten rid of the individual mandate, which is terrible.
It's been gutted. But remember this. Individual mandate, where you have the privilege of paying a lot of money for the second privilege of not having to pay for not getting health care. What kind of a deal is that? So, you pay in order to not to have to pay, because you don't want the health care because it was no good anyway.
So, we have, though our Secretary of Labor, Alex Acosta, we just came out with the association plan, which is phenomenal. Millions and millions of people are signing up. And we're coming out with another plan with Alex Azar. We are coming out with that plan in two weeks. We are coming out with so many health care plans. It is so much better than anything you've ever seen before. Competitive. And Obamacare is essentially dead.
I would have been happier with a nice yes vote instead of a no vote, but that's OK. We're doing great. And probably we wouldn't have come up with these two other plans. And it's actually three, now, other plans if we didn't.
You know, sometimes you work under pressure, and you do better, right? I think most of the people in this room, under pressure, you end up doing better. There are those people. We want to know those people. Heidi voted no on our massive tax cuts for North Dakota families. She voted "no." [Booing]
Not one Democrat voted to cut your taxes. And the other day Nancy Pelosi said we have to raise your taxes. What's that all about? She wants to raise your taxes. Heidi voted no on legislation to stop late term abortions. [Booing] Heidi voted in favor of the deadly, very, very dangerous, horrible sanctuary cities. [Booing]
You need a senator who doesn't just talk like they're from North Dakota but votes like they're from North Dakota. That's what you need. And that is Kevin Cramer. So, a vote for any Democrat is November is a vote for Schumer, Pelosi, and Maxine. [Booing]
Maxine. She's a beauty. [Laughter] I mean, she practically was telling people the other day to assault. Can you imagine if I said the things she said?
We demand that he immediately drop out of the race. Can you imagine, seriously, if I said that, or somebody else said that? Horrible, what she said. Now they want to censure her. Let's see where that goes, folks. [Laughter] Her own party was talking about censure. Let's see where that goes.
Heidi was also against us from the very beginning of the travel ban, a common-sense policy to improve our vetting and our national security. And I'm proud to report that, just yesterday, the Supreme Court upheld the travel ban...... and our authority to keep America safe.
USA! USA! USA!
And, by the way -- by the way, a lot of media back here. [Booing] If crooked Hillary would have won this election, and if she came here, which is about a zero percent change, after the election,... she'd have 200 people in a conference room in a small hotel. [Laughter]
You know, the saddest thing, we, I, we're making them rich. They never had ratings like this. You know, when the NFL is down 20 percent, it's the flag. But it's also the fact that everybody is watching us on the different cable networks. Because, frankly, they find this more exciting than the NFL, and a hell of a lot more dangerous, right?
And is there any better place to be on a nice, beautiful evening in North Dakota than at a Trump rally, right? We're having a good time.
And I wish those cameras would circle the room to see how many thousands of people are here, because, you know, on the screen I look -- and all you see are those few beautiful, wonderful people -- I don't know who the hell I -- but you've got a nice group over there. I know you have Mike and some others. They're going to be so famous. But you see, like, that little group. That's all you see on camera. Would you please circle the room for the few honest... Please circle.
Trump! Trump! Trump!
USA! USA! USA!
No, I just looked at the screen, and I said to my people, "How many people are here?" They said, "Six thousand in the arena, but we're going to be -- have to, unfortunately, walk 15,000 or 18,000 people that couldn't get in."
I said, "You've got to be kidding, because on the screen it looks like there's exactly 30 people. What the hell is this? [Laughter] The late, great, Cecil B. DeMille would not have set it up this way, I will tell you.
The travel ban ruling underscores just how critical it is to confirm judges who will support our Constitution, our great, great Constitution.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, a very special guy, also just announced a little while ago his retirement from the United States Supreme Court.
Great man. And I'm very honored that he chose to do it during my term in office, because he felt confident in me to make the right choice and carry on his great legacy. That's why he did it.
And I'd like to take a moment to show our great appreciation for Justice Kennedy's lifetime of distinguished service. Terrific man. Service to our nation, and to the cause of liberty. We were thrilled to appoint one of Kennedy's former clerks to the Supreme Court. Did you ever hear of Justice Neil Gorsuch?
He's doing great. He's a star. And Justice Kennedy is a star. And we appreciate it. We really have to take our hats off to Justice Kennedy. Thank you very much.
And remember this. So, we have a pick to come up. We have to pick a great one. We have to pick one that's going to be there for 40 years, 45 years.
Yeah.
We need intellect. We need so many things to go. You know, there's so many elements go into the making of a great Justice of the Supreme Court. You've got to hit every one of them. Heidi will vote no to any pick we make for the Supreme Court. She will be told to do so.
Now, maybe, because of this, she'll be forced to vote yes. Who knows? But I will tell you she'll vote no the day after the election on everything. Justice Kennedy's retirement makes the issue of Senate control one of the vital issues of our time. The most important thing we can do.
Democrats want judges who will rewrite the Constitution any way they want to do it, and take away your Second Amendment, erase your borders... [Booing] ... throw open the jailhouse doors and destroy your freedoms. [Booing] We must elect more Republicans. We have to do that.
And the problem is, in the Senate, we have 51. We don't have enough. We lose one. If somebody gets a bad cold, let's assume they come in for a cold, but let's assume it's worse than that. It's a very tough situation. We need more Republicans, especially in the Senate. We have to hold the House, and maybe even increase it. And I think we'll be able to do it.
They keep talking about this blue wave. Their blue wave is really sputtering pretty badly. The red wave is happening. Just look what happened last night. Famous people. Oh, they're going to be so famous tomorrow.
You were in that little group of people behind the president. Yeah. They're going to be famous people, those people. You have a better location, but they're going to be famous.
Republicans want strong borders and no crime. Very simple. Not complex. Democrats want open borders and crime, crime, crime happens automatically when you have those open borders. [Booing]
The Democrats want to let the country be overrun. Just take a look at what's going on. Everybody comes in, including the vile gang, MS-13, which Nancy Pelosi has gone out and wants to protect, OK? We don't want to protect them.
Do you remember two weeks ago, you remember that. Republicans love our military. They love our vets and our police. The Democrats are always fighting against funding for the military, and funding for law enforcement. Figure that one out.
Democrats are now launching vicious smears against our incredible ICE officers and our Border Patrol agents. Every single day the men and women of ICE and the CBP work long hours in the most dangerous conditions you can imagine, to defend our families, and to defend our communities, and to defend our borders, and defend us.
And I'll tell you what. You know, far fewer people are coming through, as much as I complain, coming through our southern border. And now it's getting worse because we have so much opportunity here. We have done so well.
And we want people to come into our country. But we want them to come into our country based on merit. Merit. Not picked out of a jar. And we're sending MS-13 out by the thousands. By the thousands. We're liberating towns in Long Island. We are sending MS-13 out. You know, our ICE officers, they're tough.
I have got to say it. It's not nice. But they're mean. But they have heart. But they go into these towns, in Long Island. I grew up in Long Island, right next to Long Island.
And these are towns that I know all my life. They're being liberated, like a foreign power has taken over the towns. Our ICE goes in there. They grab 'em by the neck. They throw 'em in the paddy wagon. We get 'em the hell out of our country.
And the Democrats are constantly complaining that we're too rough on ICE. Do you believe it? Do you see what they do? Bing, bing. Right? You see what they're doing? No, but do you see what they're doing?
They don't need guns. They like knives, because knives are much more painful. They cut people up in small pieces. Beautiful young women, walking home from school. And the Democrats complain that we're treating them too rough. We're getting them the hell out, as I said, by the thousands. Right?
Just days ago, a brave border agent was shot multiple times while protecting our border. Every day, border agents are keeping drugs, crime, and gangs from entering our country. We're going to get that wall built. We've already started it. $1.6 billion. We're getting the wall built.
Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!
It's already begun, and it's beautiful.
And I'll tell you what, they may not want to talk about it in California, but those people in San Diego are very happy with Donald Trump. I'm building that wall, and they are so happy.
They are so happy. In recent days, we've heard of shameless attacks on these courageous law enforcement officers. Extremist Democrat politicians have called for the complete elimination of ICE. "We don't want ICE anymore."
You know what would happen to parts of our country? It would be overrun with the worst criminal elements you have ever seen. Left-wing activists are trying to block ICE officers from doing their jobs, and publicly posting their home addresses, putting these incredible people and their families in harm's way. [Booing]
These radical Democrat protesters, they really want anarchy. But the only response they will find from our government is very strong law and order. We will not tolerate attacks on our law enforcement. We will protect our law enforcement, like they protect us.
We will always stand proudly with our brave heroes of ICE, the Border Patrol, the sheriffs, the police, yes, the firemen. The foremen sometimes are under attack, if you can believe it. The firemen. These are great people. And we have their backs.
Thanks to Republican leadership, America is winning again, and America is being respected again all over the world. We're respected again.
All over the world, we're respected again. You know, all those red hats and the white hats, Make America Great Again. Right? Make America Great Again. And that's what we're doing.
And what are we going -- what are we going to say in two and a half years for the next campaign? It's called Keep America Great, exclamation point. Exclamation point. Keep America Great! We gained $7 trillion in value, trillion with a "t". Trillion.
I have wealthy friends, like Harold Hamm. They don't even know what a trillion represents. I say, "Harold, how many billion are in a trillion?" And I'm not sure that Harold could answer that.
But I'll tell you what. We've gained tremendous worth, economic worth, and other worth, more important worth. We're respected again, we're putting America first, we're making great trade deals.
$7 trillion. Think of what that it. And people don't realize this. And we're going to get along with China. And we're going to get along with the European Union, which has barriers from our farmers and our people, selling product into the European Union.
Last year, with the European Union, and we love the European Union. We love the countries of the European Union. But the European Union, of course, was set up to take advantage of the United States, to attack our piggy bank, right? And you know what, we can't let that happen.
Last year, with the European Union, we lost $151 billion on trade. We had a trade deficit of $151 billion, because they send the Mercedes in. They send the BMWs in. They send their products in. We send things to them, they say, "No, thank you. We don't take your product."
That's not the way it works. And for all those free traders out there, that's not free trade. That's stupid trade. [Laughter] That's stupid trade.
So -- so, I said to them, as the great Harold Hamm would say, because to him it's a natural thing, to some of the people in here it's a nat -- because I know some of the people. They're great business people.
I said to the, very simply, "Look. If you treat us that way, and if you don't take down your barriers" -- they call them trade -- you know what they call them. Non-monetary barriers. They're barriers. Just like charging a big tariff, they charge us many times tariff.
If we send them a car which they don't want, and they practically don't take, but on the assumption it got through, they charge us many, many times what we charge them. And I said, "Look. If you're not going to treat us fairly, if you're not going to treat our workers, our companies, our farmers fairly, if you're not going to take our farm products like we take your farm products, then we're going to tax all of those beautiful Mercedes Benzes that are coming in, and we're going to tax BMWs that are coming in..."
... and we're already taxing, through tariffs, their steel and their aluminum. And, by the way, do you see what's happening with our steel industry in the last four months? It's booming again, folks. It's booming.
United States Steel is opening up six plants through expansion and new. I was in South Carolina the other night where, by the way, a great candidate won very easily. You know, our track record is extraordinarily good, right? That's why I'm here, for Kevin, that's why.
That's why I'm here. But they just announced the day I get there, they have a steel company called Georgetown. It's been closed for four years. They announced the day before I got to South Carolina that Georgetown Steel is reopening and hiring 600 people. Not so complicated.
We put tariffs on solar panels because China was flooding the market and it wasn't good stuff. We had 32 plants. Two were open and they were barely breathing. They were mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. We put a 30 percent tax on solar panels coming into the United States.
Now, those two plants are doing great. And they're talking about opening at least 10, 11, or 12, and they'll probably have them all open very soon. And they're going to make high quality panels. And a lot of jobs.
Same thing with washing machines. Sounds sort of tacky. Washing machines. Big business. They were dumping, different countries -- I don't even want to tell you this country because I actually like this country, but, you know, they all -- sometimes our worst enemies are our so-called friends or allies, right?
But they were dumping washing machines. We put a big tariff on, 30 percent. We're now making washing machines back in our country. But what else are we doing? Think of it. Just think, because you never hear this from the fake news. [Laughter]
What else are we doing? No, what else? We're creating jobs, number one. And we're taking in billions and billions of dollars into our coffers.
You know, there was a time -- there was a time when we had tariffs, because you had presidents like President McKinley and Roosevelt and others. Roosevelt, one, who liked the idea of foreign countries, when they come in and want to take our wealth, they have to pay for it. They don't take it. On top of everything else, so they take our wealth, and we even protect them with our military. We protect everybody. So, we get it every which way.
So, we want to just tell those people, number one, we created a lot of jobs. Number two, what's happening is we're taking in billions and billions -- look at the steel. We have a 25 percent tariff. We're taking in billions of dollars, creating jobs, and -- and, you know what? Even if it wasn't perfect, we need a steel industry. We were going to have no steel plants.
If something ever happened -- if something ever happened, you know what I'm talking about, and we needed steel to make that something, we wouldn't be able to make steel. We need -- you know, there are some industries, steel and aluminum, we have got to have it.
So, we have jobs, we have a vibrant industry, in a short -- the head of United States Steel called me the other day. And he said, "Mr. President, I'd like to thank you. I have never seen anything like it. We haven't opened up a new plant in 32 years. And now we're opening up seven of them. "Six of them extensions. "We're going to build a new one." And that's just one company.
The Heritage Foundation reported that in just the first 500 days of our presidency -- not my presidency. It's our presidency, let's face it. It's not my presidency. You're the one that did it. You're the one that did it. Although I've been a good student.
I told John, and I told the whole group. We had a whole group of politicians before. And, you know, some of them have been congressmen, like, for 25, 30 years. And they're asking me questions about politics. I said, "I've only been doing this for two and half years. Don't ask me a question like that." [Laughter] But we've been good students, haven't we, altogether? Haven't we been good students?
But the Heritage Foundation came out with a report, and this was as of two months ago. We've already implemented 64 percent of our top agenda items. And that's at a much faster pace than even Ronald Reagan. That's pretty good, right? And you don't hear this from the fake news. We've created 3.4 million new jobs since election day, 3.4.
Unemployment -- think of this one. Unemployment claims are at a 45-year low, and it's going to 63, I believe, probably, next month. African-American unemployment is at its lowest level in the history of our country. Hispanic-American unemployment also is at the lowest point in the history of our country.
Unemployment among women, women... remember, we were going to do so poorly with women. Look at all the women here tonight. Women for Trump.
They never take those cameras off my face. Look at all the women. Remember we were going to do so poorly with women. We did great with the women. If -- I wouldn't be standing...
My wife told me, she said, "You're going to do great with the women." It's hard to believe it, though, with the kind of press we get. Do you agree? But, you know what? They are so smart. And when they hear those numbers, they're happy.
And when you hear the numbers -- I used to go into arenas, and I'd read the horrible statistics on crime and education, and how badly people are being treated in Hispanic communities, in African-American communities. And you remember, I'd go and I'd say, "You've been voting for Democrats for 100 years. You have these horrible"-- look at my friends, right there. Great guys. My friends. Thank you.
You've had these horrible, horrible statistics for years on crime and the educational abuse, and all of the things. And I went in, and I'm reading them, point after point, and I'm seeing, and I'm -- I looked out at the audience. For 100 years they were with Democrats. The Democrats felt they had automatic votes. And I said to them, "What the hell do you have to lose? Vote for me. What do you have to lose? "What do you have to lose?"
And I came off the stage. I'll never forget it. The first time I just said it. I just said it. I didn't care. I -- honestly, I want to say what's right. I don't care. I came off the stage and my political people said, "Sir, that's a horrible thing." What's a horrible thing? "When you say, 'what the hell do you have to lose?' That's a horrible thing."
I said, "But it's true. What the hell do you have to lose?" And now, I just said African-American unemployment is at the lowest level in history. Very, very good. Thank you, [Inaudible]. Thank you. Thank you, [Inaudible]. Thank you very much. Thank you.
So, we keep going, and we keep striving. And when it's all over, nobody's done the job that we've all done. Wages are rising. You know, for those of you that were with the campaign, which I think was probably about 130 percent of you...
... you would hear me talking about wages. Where a person would have a job 21 years ago, 19 years ago from two years, where we were doing the campaign. And they made more money 19 years ago, relatively speaking, by far, than they made two years ago. And, actually, one year ago.
Their wages were going along, and they had one job. And now they'd have two and three jobs. They'd be working much harder and making much less money. And now, for the first time in 22 years, wages are rising again.
And even more importantly than that is, you have a choice of jobs. It's like the V.A. We approved choice. They've been trying to do it for 45 years. Choice. You have choice in a job. But the vets -- and you have great vets in North Dakota. Vets, vets, vets.
So, remember, I used to say about the vets -- and I wasn't a great student of the vets, but I'd read where the vets would be online for 13 days, 18 days, three weeks, seven days. And they'd start off, and they wouldn't be in bad shape. And sometimes it would take so long before seeing a doctor that they would be terminally ill. Things that could have been taken care of.
And I said, without knowing anything -- I thought it was the most brilliant policy I've ever heard. I said, "Why don't they just go to a doctor, local, that's looking for the business, that would be a very good doctor. We'll specify certain great doctors. Go to a doctor. Be taken care of. And we will pay the bill, and it will be much less expensive, and you'll be all set, right?" Right?
And I thought that was so brilliant. I said, "Oh, I am so smart. I am the smartest person." My uncle was a great professor at MIT for 40 years. Can you believe? Forty years. I said, "But I'm smarter than him. I'm smarter than anybody."
And you know what? I'll tell you. I came in, and I said that to a group of people that are professionals and have been working with the vets for a long time. They said, "Yeah, we know about that. We've been trying to get it for 30 years. We couldn't get it approved." So, I was so disappointed, because I thought it was my idea. But I'll tell you what I was good at. [Laughter]
I was good at getting it done. We got it done. I signed it. That's what I was good at. I got it done. We got it done. They'd been trying to get it done for 40 years. I was so disappointed. I thought it was my idea. That's the only problem. I thought it was my idea.
And, you know, we have another thing. Accountability with the vets. The V.A. -- there was no accountability. You'd have people that were protected, whether it was civil service unions, who cares. They were protected. You couldn't fire them.
They could be sadists, and we had sadists. Sick people. We had people that would steal and rob. We had a lot of bad people. We had people that didn't work hard. And there was no accountability. For 40 years they tried to get the V.A. Accountability Act passed. I got it passed. And now, you look at the guy that did it, and you say, "Jim Smith, you've done a hell of a lousy job. You're late, and you don't treat our vets right. Jim, I'm sorry, you're fired. Get out of here." Right? Right? "Jim, you're fired."
USA! USA! USA!
So, those two things for the -- I just approved them. The accountability was a couple of months ago. And John helped so much. I'll tell you. John helped so much. He was a leader. Thank you. He was a leader on both.
And everybody said you couldn't get accountability done. I said, "Why?" Too much power, too many unions, too many people that just don't want it done. You had people in Arizona that robbed $300,000 and they could -- they agreed. Everybody agreed. They robbed the money. They couldn't fire the people.
So now you have -- accountability is done. And I think even more important -- I'm not sure. But even more important, V.A. choice. So now you go see a doctor when you have to wait on line. OK?
Optimism among America's great manufacturers has hit 95 percent, the highest number by far in the history of the survey, which is a very old survey. We have eliminated record numbers of job-killing regulations.
I think maybe as important as the tax cuts are the regulations. Our country was choking. And let me tell you, if our opponent, our wonderful opponent...
Lock her up!
... when is she going to get over it? When does she get over it?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!
Oy, when do they get over it? But, you know, it is pretty amazing. Point after point, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty. Oh, she's OK.
And then they go after us for a Russian hoax. It's a witch hunt hoax. It's -- isn't it incredible, when you talk about a double standard? When you talk about a double standard. And nobody even looks at her. Nobody even looks, I don't think, unless we're going to be surprised some day. Well, we'll see how that works out.
But I'll tell you what. What's happened is somewhat of a miracle because we weren't expected to win. But every time I'd go out, we'd have crowds like this. We went to Michigan. We went to Wisconsin. We went to places that haven't been done. I think Wisconsin was 1952. Dwight Eisenhower. And we won Wisconsin.
And Wisconsin, I went there, and I said, "I think we're going to win this state." And people said to me, "Oh, sir. It won't happen." I said, "Why? Look at the crowds we're getting. Look at the people. Look at the signs outside of the house. Look at the signs."
I heard, and maybe it's not so, that Bill Clinton, President Bill Clinton, went back, and he went through Michigan. And he said, "You'd better get some people out to Michigan, because there's a Trump-Pence sign on every house. You'd better get people out." And they said, "Oh, no. Our statistics show that Michigan cannot be won by the Republicans."
Well, let me tell you what's happened. Car plants are moving into Michigan. Jobs are moving into Michigan. Michigan's very happy with your president. They should have listened to Bill Clinton. They should have listened. And we just had our highest poll numbers. And I watch these fakers back there, and they'll be talking. [Booing]
Well, you saw the polls that come out -- I don't know if this is true. You know, a year and a half ago, they said I was an interloper. How bad is that? An interloper. And now they say, and you will admit, a thing comes out, a big poll, and a couple of polls. A number of polls that, "He's the most powerful, most popular, Republican in the history of the party." And a little while ago I was an interloper.
They came out "more popular than" a man I like, Ronald Reagan. Well -- but think of it. You go from interloper -- that's a horrible term, right? I was just doing my thing. I'm not an interloper.
But we have tremendous -- look at the people. We endorsed Dan Donovan. He was behind. We endorsed him. He won by, like, 24 points or something last night, in Staten Island, New York, and New York generally. Dan Donovan, Congressman.
Last night we had a great evening because we watched that television and we were winning left and right. They didn't know what the hell happened. And one of my biggest critics, a slovenly man named Joe Crowley, got his ass kicked... [Laughter]
... by a young woman who had a lot of energy. She had a lot of energy. I guess he didn't see it. They couldn't find him. He spent a lot of money. He actually had a lot of money left over. Everyone is pouring a fortune because they figure -- and he was going to take Nancy Pelosi's place.
And I was so disappointed, because I want to keep Nancy Pelosi right where she is, with Maxine Waters. I want to keep Nancy Pelosi. Please, I want to make a plea to my Democrat friends. Please, please, please don't remove Nancy Pelosi. She should be where she is. And please keep Maxine Waters on the air, as your face and your mouthpiece for the Democrat Party. Please.
Maxine and Nancy. So, I was disappointed in a way when he got beaten, because he was going to take her place, I think. Now, he's just looking at us and saying, "Darling, what happened?" Politics is a mean game, isn't it? It's a mean -- it's a fleeting game. Six months ago, Republicans passed the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history.
Thank you.
Our plan doubled the child tax credit, thank you to Ivanka Trump. She wanted that so badly. She really got to be a pest. "Dad, you've got to get child tax credit." I said, "Darling, nobody knows what it is." She said, "The women know, Dad. The women know."
My daughter and my wife, Melania, they love -- they love the women. And the women love them. The women love them. And the men love them. Child tax credits. People don't talk about it that much. It's very substantial. And you know we got it for you.
We slashed taxes for working families, most of them in half, and saved our family farms and our small businesses by eliminating the estate tax in almost all cases. It's known as the death tax. And now, when you leave your small business or your farm, you leave it to your children. Your children don't go -- have to back. They don't go to the bank, borrow money, and end up losing the farm or losing the business.
Thank Kevin and John and the whole group, they helped us a lot. And guess what. Heidi voted against it. OK? She voted against it. [Booing]
Heidi voted against it. And she's always going to vote against it. And by the way, she may give us a couple of quickie votes, you know, before the election. She might, because she has no choice. But the day after that election, she's voting party line, 100 percent.
More than 100 utility companies nationwide have slashed prices for customers, saving them and this country much more than $3 billion, which goes and reduces your electric and utility bill.
Heidi and every single Democrat voted against our tax cuts. We're also fixing the disastrous trade deals that have plundered our wealth, gutted our communities, undermined our great farmers, taken our jobs. We are going to make trade fair and reciprocal. Reciprocal. You know what that is. They do it to us. We do it to them.
And we are placing very big tariffs on some of these countries, because they have tariffs on us. It's incredible. I wonder where these people come from. Even politicians.
So, we'll have a country. It doesn't matter. I can almost name any of them. They have massive tariffs on our people, on our workers, on our farmers, on our country, on our companies. So, we say we're going to put tariffs on them. And I'll actually have politicians and other people come to me. "Oh, please. We want free trade." How is it free trade?
I'll give you an example. China. If we make a car and sell it into China, they charge us a 25 percent tax. That's what it is. Twenty-five percent.
When they make a car and sell it into the United States, and there are a lot of them, we charge them the grand total of 2.5 percent, and they don't pay that. [Booing]
And then when I want to raise the game and play the game of poker, a game that we can't lose, I'll get even politicians, mostly Democrats, but even a couple of Republicans. They'll say, "We want free trade."
That's not free trade. That's not fair trade. It is so ridiculous. Just play the game for a little while. It's a game we can't lose.
You know, I've said a couple of times, when we're $500 billion down, they say, "Trump is starting a trade war." I say no. The trade war ended a long time ago, and the United States lost because our leaders didn't take care of our people and our companies.
So, we're not starting a trade war, but we'll finish it. And you know what? In the end, you know what's going to happen. And it's already happening. Already happening.
They're going to come to us, and they're going to say, "Hey, let's work it out." And we're going to work it out. It's very simple. But remember -- it is. It's the art of the deal, but anybody can do the deal. There are a lot of people. This one doesn't get much simple.
Remember, it's true. When you're $500 billion down, you can't lose. You already lost. But now we're going to start winning. Or at least we're going to make it fair. It doesn't even have to -- we've got to make it fair.
And the fact that we've had presidents and we've had leaders that worked for those presidents, negotiators, trade reps, who were missing in action. They weren't doing their job.
You know, I was dealt a lot of bad hands. I was given North Korea where, frankly, we were very close to going to war. You could have lost 30 million people, 50 million people. Seoul is 30 miles off the border. They have what they call cannons, like howitzers. They have cannons, thousands of them, pointed.
I had the meeting. We had a great relationship. We had a great chemistry together. The fake news was so upset when I said we had a good relationship. We had a good chemistry. They said, "That's a horrible thing." No, no. It's a good thing. Getting along with countries, getting along with China, getting along with Russia, getting along with these countries is a good thing. It's not a bad thing. Not a bad thing.
And so, we have things cooking now. You're going to be so happy. But when people rush it -- you know, it's like rushing the turkey out of the stove. It's not going to be as good. The women can tell me, and some of the men. See, today I have to be politically correct. See, in the old days... [Laughter]
... in the old days I would have never -- I just would have said, "Oh, I don't want to. It's too hokey." But it's true. Some of the men can tell me, too. Right? Some of the men.
But here's what we do. The more they rush, the worse it's going to be. The longer we take, the better. Your farmers, your people are going to be great.
You know, John -- I'll tell you, John and Kevin gave me something. They just told me this. Canadian wheat markets consistently discriminate against the United States' wheat by grading it as feed. Do you know what that means? They know what it means. I don't know what the hell it means. I just know it's a bad deal. [Laughter]
But it's true. Canada charges us on dairy products a tariff of 275 percent, for you farmers in here. Two hundred. That's like saying, "We don't want your dairy products." It's no good.
That's like saying, "We don't want North Dakota, Wisconsin, New York State. We don't want you there." Two hundred and seventy-five percent. And I actually hear that's an old number. They raised it a number of months ago to 300 percent. How horrible is that?
And then Justin gets up. He said, "We fought World War I, we fought World War II," all true, "together." All true. We love Canada. But they're taking advantage of us. We can't let that happen. We can't let it happen. The era of global freeloading and taking advantage of the United States is over. It's just over.
We're also restoring American security by rebuilding our military. We've secured a historic $700 billion. Just got it approved. $700 billion. We're rebuilding our military. And next year, already approved, $716 billion. We're rebuilding our military. It will be bigger and stronger than ever before. And hopefully we will never have to use it, because when it's bigger and stronger, you tend not to have to use it, OK? And in addition to that, we got $6 billion for drugs and fighting opioid abuse. $6 billion.
We believe in peace. But it's got to be peace through strength, not weakness. Peace through strength. And I've directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, called the Space Force. The Space Force.
Space Force. Because space is the new frontier. And I'm not just talking about going to up to the moon and going to Mars. And I want the rich guys -- you know, we have rich guys. They love these rockets. I said, "Lease them the land. Charge them a lot. They'll..." -- they just want to send rockets.
But I look at it, with Bezos, with Elon Musk, they all love rockets. I said, "That's OK. Let's do it." Let them send a rocket up to Mars. Let's be the first. I hope they go fast. Let's help them. Let's make it really good for them. And if they do it, we're going to claim it on behalf of the United States, OK?
We'll give them no credit. Let them spend the money. I think it's great. But I have a lot of military guys. And space, from a military standpoint, is really the new frontier. So, we're going to have a Space Force. Every day we are keeping our promises. But to keep this momentum going, we need Kevin Cramer in the Senate.
All of us tonight are united by the same tireless values. We have pride in our history, respect for our great, beautiful, wonderful American flag, right?
We put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance. And we proudly stand for our national anthem. Right? Proudly stand.
In everything we do, we are standing up for our citizens. We are standing up for America, and we are standing up for North Dakota. Thank you.
The forgotten men and women of our country are forgotten no more. No more. They don't know where they all came from.
And by the way, our people, they call it the base, they used to say it's 35. Then they said it's 40. Then they said it's 42. Then they have these polls go -- we're driving them crazy. Now they say it's over 50 percent And then they said -- some great people. They said, "Any time Trump gets a poll, add 12 to it."
Really. And did you ever notice -- I hate it. I meet these people. They call them the elite. These people. I look at them. I say, "That's elite?"
We got more money. We got more brains. We got better houses, apartments. We got nicer boats. We're smarter than they are. And they say, "The elite." We're the elite. You're the elite.
We're the elite. So, I said the other day, "Let's keep calling these people." And look, let's face it. They've been stone cold losers, the elite. The elite.
So, let's let them keep calling themselves the elite. But we're going to call ourselves -- and remember, you are indeed. You work harder, but you are indeed smarter than them. Let's call ourselves from now on the super-elite. We're the super-elite. We are the super-elite.
You are the people who farm the prairies, tame the badlands, and squeeze oil out of rock. Ugh. You celebrate your heritage, and you live life proudly under the big beautiful skies. And you have the big beautiful skies out here.
Loyal citizens like you helped rebuild this country and together we are taking back our country, returning power to the everyday, smart, brilliant, wonderful, hard-working American people.
We are standing on the shoulders of the American patriots who settled the frontier, scaled the Rockies, and won the American west. These are great, incredible, strong tough, tough people. This state was forged by pioneer men and women who braved the cold and tamed the wilderness to build a home on the plains and a life for their families. And it's been an incredible life. These North Dakota pioneers were tough as hell and they were strong and they were smart.
And they all had one thing in common. They loved their families. They loved their countries, and they loved their God. They never gave up and they never, ever, gave in. And neither will we. We will never stop fighting for our country, our families, and we will never, ever, stop fighting for our freedom.
As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never ever fail. With your help, with your voice, with your vote, we will win, win, win.
Like we're doing. Remember how I started. This country, our country, our flag, we are respected again. All over the world they're talking about us. Leaders from all over the world, they call me, or they come to the Oval Office, and they say, "Congratulations, Mr. President, on the incredible job with the economy, the incredible job you're doing with your country. The fact that your country is respected again, congratulations, Mr. President." Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
And together, we will make America wealthy again. We will, and are, making America strong again. We will make America safe again. Look at our military. We will make our great, great America stronger and more powerful than ever before.
We will make America loving again. Love it. Love it. We're going to come together. And we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, North Dakota. Go out and get Kevin Cramer in the -- thank you, Kevin. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, North Dakota. It's a great honor. Thank you.
Wow, thank you. Thank you. [Audience chants USA] Everybody, thank you and Vice President Mike Pence, thank you very much. Incredible. And hello to Fayetteville. Hello Fayetteville. It's great to be here in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District with the hardworking patriots who believe in faith, family, God, and country.
Thank you. Thank you. Tomorrow, you head to the polls to elect a congressman who always puts America first,  Dan Bishop.  I've just come from a meeting with North Carolina officials representing communities hit by Hurricane Dorian, and I expressed the unwavering solidarity of the American people. We are behind you 100%, 100%. The prayers of our entire nation, are with the citizens of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and everyone else that was in the storm's path, and I will say I was called by the government of the Bahamas and we're helping with the Bahamas.
They were hit so hard. They were hit so hard. Who would believe it. We pledged the full support of the federal government through every step of the rebuilding process, and I will say North Carolina in our country probably, got hit the hardest. That was a little bit of a surprise, but I know one thing about North Carolina: you can take it and you'll build it quickly and you'll build it beautifully, and you'll be back sooner than anybody ever thought and it'll be better than ever, right?
No doubt about.  I also want to give a special recognition to the many nongovernmental organizations doing so much to help people recover from Dorian. In particular, Franklin Graham, he's a wonderful guy and he's got an organization samaritan's Purse based right here in North Carolina and the work that Franklin and his family and all of those that are with Franklin Graham, we want to thank them.
Special, great people. Great people. Thank you, Franklin. Thank you. Incredible job. He does such a great job all over, wherever there's a problem. You see Samaritans first and Franklin and his people. We love the people of this state and we will never ever leave your side. North Carolina will truly recover so fast, I know you people so well.
Let's not even talk about it. Let's not even talk about it. We're here tonight to discuss the extraordinary progress we're making as a nation and how to ensure this amazing resurgence keeps on going and going strong. In just over two years, we've taken this big beautiful ship and it's being turned around very quickly.
Nobody thought this would happen.  You know we won the greatest election, certainly one of them, but maybe the greatest, but we won one of the greatest. Let's say one, this way I won't be criticized. They'll say, "You know George Washington had a great election too." The fake news, right? The fake news. But we won one of the greatest elections in history and because of that, and you would be in big trouble if we didn't, I can tell you that.
You'd be -- instead of going up, we were heading in the wrong direction. We have the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world and every time I meet a foreign leader almost every time they say, "Congratulations on what you've done with the economy." I said, "I didn't do it. I just set a certain path. The people of the United States did it." No. 1 anywhere in the world.
And they tried to do the recession thing. You know, they tried to rush a thing, that didn't work. They tried many other things, I always say the media and their partner, the Democrats. I wouldn't mind fighting the Democrats, but we really have to look at as it -- to some it's the media and the Democrats.
It's one and the same. We're rebuilding our military, defending our sovereignty and reclaiming our dignity as a nation. America is winning again and America is respected again. They respect America. [Audience chants USA] By the way, I have about like 10 women in the front row and you come from North Carolina and they travel all over the place.
Hold up your hands. These are great women. I see them so much and I must say they have other things to do. They look rich as hell to me, I don't know. How many is this, how many rallies have you come to? They can't count it. They said all of them, except for two. That's a lot of rallies and it all emanates from this area.
That's so great. Well, at least you won't have to travel so far for this one, right? Thank you very much for being here. We really appreciate it. Well, we appreciate, we appreciate it. Thank you. Really incredible people. But you know, we've created six million new jobs since Election Day, and I couldn't say that in my initial rallies, because nobody would have believed that.
Six million new jobs. More Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country. Almost 160 million Americans, nobody would have thought that was possible. We wouldn't have been able to say it, actually. We've now had 13 straight months of wage gains of at least 3%, so that people that work so hard, you remember I used to say during the rallies before we won, people worked two jobs, three jobs and they made less money than they made 21 years before, and now wages are going up, the economy is doing great and jobs have never been better.
So importantly, more than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Nearly 600,000 Americans entered the labor force last month alone. Think of that. And the unemployment rate for African-Americans just reached another brand new, yesterday, all-time low in the history of our country. How do you lose that debate?
Remember I used to say, "What do you have to lose?" Well now you have the best unemployment numbers, employment and unemployment numbers that you've ever had as African-Americans, as Asian-Americans, as Hispanic-Americans. The best numbers we've ever had. And by the way, African-American youth unemployment has also reached the lowest level ever recorded in history and the labor force participation rate for women is at the highest level now in 15 years and soon will be 35 years, and soon, I promise, will probably end up being better than ever.
I can tell you the unemployment numbers for women are the best they've been, now, in 72 years. So I always say kiddingly, I'm sorry I didn't make it historic, but you know what it's going to be historic very soon. That would be historic, guys.  Ad here in North Carolina over 230,000 more people now have jobs and small business formation has skyrocketed by more than 25%. There you go. But the radical democrats want to dismantle, demolish, and destroy everything that you've gained and they will do it, and it won't take that long and that's why we need Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy.
We need them. We need them going down to Congress and helping, but they can do it. It's also why we need four more years. It has to see this like a plant. We've changed things right, keep America Great, we've changed things, but it's got to grow. It's got a develop those roots, and once it does ,it's going to be very hard for them to destroy what we've done, very hard.
And that's really why I consider this election -- Look. We had a very, very special day in 2016. It was a very special time. A very special time. It's an incredible day,  an incredible month, an incredible year, and I don't know that you can ever compare anything to it. But I can say: this, 2020 is essentially just as important, because they'll try and take it away, whether it has to do with religion or evangelicals are here tonight and they're all over the place.
And what we've done for them and for religion is so important. You know the other side, I don't think they're big believers and not big believers in religion that I can tell you. You listen to some of them. They're trying. They're trying to put out little statements, they're not working too well. Those statements are a little bit sort of not too good huh.
What is the word we want to use here? A little -- No, no. They're pushing a little hard and it's not play, it's not working. To stop the far left, you must vote in tomorrow's special election, so important. Or get your votes in early. I think a lot of -- Who voted early for Dan Drescher? Well, that's good, but the big thing is tomorrow.
Tomorrow's the election and you'll get out to protect your family. You must defeat open borders and you have a Democrat named Dan McCready and he wants open borders. He wants sanctuary cities he's not going to protect your Second Amendment he's doing nothing on your Sec -- You know North Carolina's, a very big Second Amendment state.
And Dan Bishop, Greg Murphy, these guys, they're going to protect your Second Amendment, but one of the biggest issues in this election is, in fact, sanctuary cities. McCready supports sanctuary city policies that force prisons and jails to release criminal aliens directly into your neighborhoods. Get out, go ahead, go into the neighborhood.
Go and -- What's your neighborhood? Where do you live? [Audience member responds inaudibly]
Rutherford County. OK. So how do you feel about having them released? Hardened,  horrible criminals into Rutherford County. I don't think so. But your whole state, it's honestly -- Can I be honest? It's crazy what's happening. This whole thing with sanctuary cities and you go to California, which has so many sanctuary cities. They don't know, what's happening out there. You have people that want to get rid of those sanctuary cities.
They just aren't able to do it with the people that get elected a lot of illegal voting going on out there, by the way. A lot of illegal voting. In August, McCready said it was quote, "The right call to set illegal alien criminals loose in the great state." I'm using the words great state, he doesn't, up North Carolina.
With the support and encouragement of McCready's sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina have released thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into your communities, and you see it, you see it. The charges against these three criminals include sexual assault, robbery, drug crimes, kidnapping, and homicide, murder.
Why would you do it? Why would you do it? What is it explain it just recently, Mecklenburg County set free, an illegal alien charged with first --
[Technical Difficulties interrupt feed for 135 seconds]
Hello, North Carolina. Hello, Fayetteville. Hello, 9th District of North Carolina. Mr. President, we're not tired of winning. We want to keep on winning. And tomorrow, Tuesday, September 10, 2019, we're going to win the 9th District of North Carolina. We've all watched as the Democratic Party, the socialist democrat party, seeks the President's destruction every day.
We've seen a dishonest media serve as their handmaidens and their allies in that mission.
We've watched as the greatest fighter ever to occupy the White House has pushed them more. Mr. President, you don't need -- Mr. President, you don't need North Carolina, the 9th District. You got someone -- all right -- we got someone who [Inaudible] over here. Give him some space.
[An audience member experiences medical distress] A doctor in the house, please. Doctor, please. Doctor in the house. Thank you. Take your time. Please take your time. I have plenty of time. Thank you. Take your time. Thank you, doctor. Take your time. People have been staying outside for two days to get in so this happens.
Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Doing better? Good. That's good. That's good. That's great. That's really great. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. That's really great. Thank you very much. I guess Dan's speech wasn't so good. That's great. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you, doctor. Thank you, everybody.
Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I trust that person will be OK. Let's all say a prayer for that person to be all right. Yeah. Because that's what we do, we pray. And I share your values, I'm not ashamed of your values, I'm going to defend your values in Washington D.C.
As this great fighter faces all those long odds. The Socialist Democrats, the fake media, the last thing he needs is for the ninth district to send him another Nancy Pelosi clone. President Trump needs nobody else in Washington who supports sanctuary cities and counties here in North Carolina or anywhere else.
What's going to happen tomorrow, on Tuesday, September 10, is the 9th District is going to send the congressman with backbone, who can stand up to the smears and the lives of the lying, fake news media and support the President of the United States, as he keeps America great. And what I need you to do, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, I need you to vote.
I need you to vote, but that's not all. I need you to vote, but beyond that, take a lesson from President Donald J. Trump. Don't rely on them to get our message out. Take out your phone go to votedanbishop.com. I'm going to repeat that, go to votedanbishop.com and right there at the top of that website, you're going to see a video featuring the President of the United States, telling you to vote for right Dan not wrong Dan, and right below that video, that little frame, you're going to see buttons three buttons to share that video.
And you don't have to rely on that news media. You can use those buttons and send that out to all of your friends on Facebook, on Twitter or on email so they'll know that President Trump can have a fighter for the values of the 9th District in Washington D.C.
Tomorrow's our chance. Let's tell him, let's show him, go out and vote for right Dan. Vote for Dan Bishop tomorrow, September 10. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you.
Thank you, Dan. That was a good job. That was a good job. He means it too, he's great.  Get out and vote tomorrow for Dan Bishop, please. So we've had great support over the last six months, in particular, from a man who happens to be your senator right now, and we need him to keep going because he has been fantastic and I believe he's here tonight.
I just came in. The weather wasn't so great to be traveling today. They said, "Maybe we could skip North Carolina today, sir." I said, "No, thank you." I said, "No, thank you." Can you imagine? And by the way, I have to say, we have a big crowd in here, right? You have to see outside thousands and thousands of people who couldn't get in and when people wait two or three days to come in and especially these first rows, I just want to tell you we really thank you.
Incredible. But Thom Tillis has really worked with us over the last bit of time. He's recently introduced a bill to give American victims the right to sue sanctuary cities. That's a big deal. And hold them accountable for the lives that they've shattered.  But to pass the bill we need more Republicans tomorrow.
There is another crucial, special election and we have a fantastic guy running in that one too, Republican Greg Murphy who looks like he's in good shape, but you've got to get out. So I want to introduce Thom Tillis and I want to introduce Greg Murphy and I want to thank you both. Thank you. Thank you, Thom, and thank you, Greg.
So Greg Murphy is looking to, like Dan, cut your taxes, defend your Second Amendment support our policies. Really, really support our military and our veterans. We have rebuilt our military. Greg Murphy come on up for a second here. Greg Murphy. Come up, come up, Greg. Come on up, Greg. Come on up Greg just for a second, then we'll get back to business.
We got to do this, and I don't know, he's been a great champ. Thank you, Greg. Come.
Thank you, Mr. President. Hello, Fayetteville. Hello, Fayetteville. It is a pleasure to be amongst people who believe in God, country, and family. Our Democrats have given up on God. They've pushed it away from our country, they want to give our country away and they want to destroy the nuclear family. We have a President, a bold man who has brought those three principles back to our faith and to our country.
We need to come out and support him. So I ask you tomorrow, tomorrow, please it was actually good for me to see that actually few of you have already voted, because every single one of you needs to show up tomorrow and support Dan Bishop as your next Congressman or actually me, if I'll be your next congressman, we are here to serve you.
We are here to help our President and we are here to keep America great. God bless you all.
Good luck tomorrow, Greg. Get out there vote for those two guys, they're terrific. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many more terrific Republican leaders, a man who's really been stepping up to the front. He defended Justice Kavanaugh when he was treated so badly. I've never seen anything like the treatment that Justice Kavanaugh received.
And everybody respects him and everybody likes him and I like him, and we used to fight like hell, right? We do. But we don't fight anymore. We like each other a lot and he's a special man and he's become a special friend. Senator Lindsey Graham. Another man, who's a fighter. I guess we're all fighters, you have to be a fighter you're not going to be here very long.
I can tell you that. We got to fight them more than anybody else. But a man who has done an incredible job in Washington took over a rough situation and he's become the real leader. He is a leader like you haven't seen and that's Republican Leader, Kevin McCarthy. Kevin. Kevin is working so hard for so many different people.
He wants to see Dan and Greg win so badly. Thank you for being here, appreciate it leader. Representative David Rouzer, David, thank you. David Rouzer. He's done a fantastic job. Our Lieutenant Governor, who is going to be, I think, a highly competitive candidate for a very important race, Dan Forest. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you very much, Dan. We also have North Carolina Republican party chair, Michael Whatley. What a job he's done. And we have a man from North Carolina who loves the state, he fights so hard. He doesn't know what it is not to fight. You know what who I'm talking about? They got it, Mark. They're all screaming Mike Meadows.
That's right. He's great. So many, Jim Jordan, Andy Biggs, gates, and I just got some -- by the way, Devin Nunes. How about Devin? He was out there when it wasn't in vogue to be saying that Komi was a stone, cold liar, and leaker, but he knew a long time. Devin Nunes, but Mark Meadows has been incredible.
And do they love him in your state? Do they love him? Do they love Mark Meadows? Thank you, Mark. Also a friend of mine has been with us from the beginning, he's not a politician, but he might as well be one. He loves us, he loves this party and he loves your state, lives here, Louis DeJoy, one of the most successful people.
Thank you, Louis and your wife is doing a great job, Louis. And a very special thanks to my son, Don Jr. and Kimberly. Great job. Did Don Jr. give a good speech? I heard that they all said he was on fire. Well, he's fighting. He loves this country. My son loves this country, my family loves this country and you know, two people from your state that the first lady before she was first lady, she said,  you know, there are two people that are unbelievable.
You got to watch him. I said I'm not interested. I'm too busy? No, no, No, You have to watch him. I've never seen this so great they're, so smart, they love the country, they love you, Diamond and [Inaudible] They are incredible. Incredible people. Thank you very much. Thank you. What a job and they're doing very well.
I have to tell you that.  Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100% pro-American. [Audience chants USA] And by the way, so is Doug Collins and so is John Ratcliffe. Thank you, fellas. Thank you. Two incredible fighters also. For decades, our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests.
You know that better than anybody. And this state knows it better than anybody. They traded away your factories, sold your future, squandered your tax dollars, sacrifices your security and bog this down in one foreign debacle after another. But all of that has changed. You're respected again, they're all saying, oh gee, I hope he doesn't do this or that.
They've taken advantage of us for years, and I have to say, sadly, in many cases, it's our allies that took the greatest advantage of this country. But now you finally have a President who understands that. I'm not supposed to be the President of the world, I'm supposed to be the President of the United States.
To bring back our jobs from other countries, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We've cut a record number of job killing regulations. No President, no matter how long they serve, has gotten anywhere even close to what we've done with regulations and that's one of the reasons our economy is so good.
And we have tremendous potential upward and China wants to talk. They want to talk.  China's lost three million jobs, thousands of companies are leaving China. The supply chain is crumbling because they can't pay the tariffs, and our country has taken over things that you would have never thought. As an example, hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs and China's eating the cost, which the fake news doesn't want to tell you.
And out of the tens of billions of dollars that we've taken in -- because of the fact that our great American patriot farmers have been targeted by China, they've been targeted, because they know the farmers like Trump -- I love the farmers, so they targeted the farmers and I said to Sonny Perdue, secretary of Agriculture.
Sonny, how much was it? Last year and the year before, tell me. It was $12 billion and it was $16 billion and out of the tariffs that we've taken in, we gave to our farmers for distribution, hopefully, very good distribution, hopefully, very even distribution we've given them $28 billion so that their whole, so that their whole.
Nobody would ever do that. Nobody would ever do that. I can tell you that right now.  And our farmers know we have to fight. I see it all the time, where some of the networks that are crazy, they have a group of farmers. In some cases they have groups of women, they say, "What do you think of President Trump?", "We like him a lot.
We're with him all the way." And they want to turn off the cameras they go crazy, but with the farmers, you know that. You ever see that, the 10 women? "What do you think of President Trump?", "We love him?" Oh, I like to put you on television, I'll tell you that. and they can't turn off those cameras fast enough, but they said to the farmers, "You voted for President Trump, are you happy?" and every one of them said, "He did things and nobody has ever done before?" Who would think of getting 12 billion plus, 16 billion, $28 billion because they've been targeted?
That's the amount. I asked Sonny. I said, "Sonny, what's the amount they took out of our farmers, there was 16 billion and the year before, 12, and I said, "Sonny, we've got to make that up." and we made it up. Who would do that? Nobody would do that. First of all, nobody else ever had tens of billions of dollars pouring in from China because it's always been the other way around.
China has taken advantage of our country for decades, decades, and I guarantee you one thing. None of these Democrats, whether it's Pocahontas or sleepy Joe, none of them, would be able to do a think about it, and nobody would ever think of helping the farmers who have been targeted by China. China made $500 billion over the last number of years.
On a yearly basis, they steal our intellectual property, so many other things. So now it's just different, and now it's working the other way and tariffs are a beautiful thing when you know how to use them. They're a beautiful. And I want China to do well and I hope they do well, but they've had now the worst year in 57 years.
I wonder why. I wonder why. And hopefully it all work out, we'll see we're going to be talking next week. We're talking now they're going to be coming to the United States in two or three weeks and we'll see what happens, but unless we're going to make a good deal or a fair deal for our country, let's face it. We cannot go back to a situation, we're giving hundreds of billions of dollars to China become standard fare not going to happen.
We can't do it.  And we have many other countries also, but we'll worry about them a little bit later, plenty of others, plenty of others. They've taken advantage of our country, like you wouldn't believe. And I've been saying this for many years. I was saying this when I was a private citizen. They take our jobs, they make our product, they sell the product into our country with no tax, no nothing.
So we end up with closed factories, no jobs, no taxes, no nothing. And these other countries gain as an example, Mexico, I must say. They've really helped us at the border. The Democrats will not do anything about these horrible, open loopholes, which would be so good. So we're doing it a different way and Mexico is now patrolling with 27,000 troops.
They'd never had two trips to it. Our border. And you saw the numbers today we're down approximately 57%, but our country could fix it so easy if the Democrats would sit with me for 15 minutes, but they don't want to do that because they want to have open borders, they want to have drugs pouring into our country.
You have to have a wall and you have to stop it and when you look at what's happening with human trafficking and it's mostly women, they traffic, in women, and they pour through our borders. Well, every inch of wall that we put up is vital and we're putting up miles and miles, and we intend by next year, at the end of the year, to have anywhere between 400 and 500 miles of wall built, and this is serious wall.
This is the real deal. Serious wall. And I want to thank our new secretary of defense, Mark Esper, for the job he's done and he views it really as a national security threat, and you have to. What can be much more threatening than people that want to pour Across our borders and we have the worst laws, we have the weakest laws in the history of any country.
You can't do anything to stop them. You have a program, catch and release. You catch them, and then you have to release them and they're supposed to come back to court in the next three, four, five, six years and nobody shows up and the Democrats don't want to fix it, so we're stopping them. So we don't even have to worry about court.
We ended the last administration's cruel war on American energy. The United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And for all of these crazy people, but they're not so crazy, they know what they're doing. They're talking about Russia, Russia, Russia. Russia's not too happy about that.
Their primary source of income is oil and gas, and now we're bigger than Russia, bigger than Saudi Arabia, we're bigger than everybody, and we're doing great. So they're not exactly happy. The Russian hoax was a pure hoax. You saw that with me the other day, yet every leading Democrat running for President pledges to ban the energy that drives our economy and wage and under -- If you look at what's going on, your way of life is under assault by these people.
I mean, I go out, and sometimes I visit these huge audiences and I wish we could have gotten a larger arena than this. We tried. I was even willing to stand out in the rain and get my hair soaking wet, but they said it was a little bit out of your district, And I said, "I don't know if it looks good being out of your district." But I was willing to do it. And I would have taken it, I would have been very proud to have done it. It would have shown it's my real hair, at least.
It wouldn't be pretty. It's my hair, may not be great, but I will say it's better than most of my friends who are the same age, a lot better, a lot.  But I do, you know, we had a different location, as you all know.  And we said, let's do this one is bigger and we put screens outside for all of the people we have screens and loudspeakers and everything it's really amazing what's going on out there.
But after years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country, that's the bottom line. And the last administration, with Biden and Obama at the helm, they tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you could have kissed many of your industries goodbye.
TPP would have gutted the American auto industry. It would have been even worse than NAFTA, and we know how bad NAFTA was. All you have to do is even to this day look around at all those empty plants where people move down and companies move down to Mexico, not under the USMCA. We got to get Nancy Pelosi to put it up for a vote, make it bipartisan.
She'll have tremendous Democrats support the farmers want it, the unions want it, the manufacturers want it, and by the way, 600,000 manufacturing jobs in this country, remember? You would need a magic wand. You can't do that anymore. Well, we did, but we've got to get USMCA put up for a vote by the Democrats, but in my first week in office I proudly withdrew from that job destroying TPP catastrophe.
And we're replacing one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country. You can go back as far as you want, NAFTA. The disaster of NAFTA, so whatever you do, start talking to your people, we need a vote on the USMCA, that's United States, Mexico and Canada and they've already voted. They want it and we want it and it's great for the farmers, it's great for everybody.
We're also aggressively combating a problem that you have in North Carolina, problem that we have in almost all states, the opioid epidemic. Last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug-overdose deaths in nearly 31 years and at the center of the American drug crisis is the border crisis. Criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across our southern border, including heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl.
A hundred thousand people a year die from what comes across our southern border and we can't get the Democrats to help us in sealing it even tighter. We got to get them, we got ta get them. So if you want to stop the drug smugglers, the human traffickers, the vicious MS -3 gang members, and by the way, thank you to ICE, these people go into those -- they go into those -- Yes, we call them nest [ph] he's a vicious, vicious people.
We go into the nest with our ice people and you know for them it's another day at the office. There aren't too many people in this room that want to do it for a living. Let me see. That guy, good. Maybe him,  maybe her, right. Maybe her, but it's a rough job and they get so little praise for the job they do so dangerous.
These are -- These are many killers in those gangs and we're taking them out of our country by the thousands and MS-13. And as you know, Democrats even want to give free health care to illegal immigrants. As long as I'm your President, I will never ever let Democrats take away your health care and give it away free to people that have entered our country illegally.
We can't do a tremendous incentive to come in. Democrats also want to bring in unlimited numbers of foreign refugees from overseas all at the expense of supporting their own communities. Republicans, no matter what you do, where you are, we want people to obey our laws. We want people that are going to help our country.
The Democrat Party has never been farther outside of the mainstream. Every major Democrat running for President supports a massive government takeover of health care that would raid Medicare forced private doctors out of medicine and lead to the rationing of life saving treatments. And you know they're going to take away your private health care, your private insurance.
One hundred and eighty million people will lose with what they want to do. It's a disaster. You know it's like -- Did you ever really sort of feel where you don't even have to treat people nicely? You don't have any choice. You have to vote for me. I can leave right now. I can say, "North Carolina, I've had it with you, I'm leaving right now." And you know what, you got to go out and vote.
What are you going to do, put one of these crazy people running our country again? But it's never been so far left. I told the story the other day about a businessman I saw one of the biggest in the country. You probably know his name, one of the biggest. He's hated me for 20 years that I've hated him also, OK, Now they're going to go out tomorrow, breaking news, "Donald Trump, hates people." and you're sort of right about that.
I never liked this guy and I see him in the White House and I say, "What are you doing here?" and he goes, "Mr. President..." see, now he calls me Mr. President, he used to call me something else. "Mr. President, I'm fighting for your victory." I said, "You got to be kidding." He goes, "Honestly you're doing a great job, but also if this radical left gets in they're, going to take away everything and they're going to destroy our country." and for the first time I like this guy.
My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you.  Remember, President Obama, 28 times, remember, 28 times they counted him and there's much more than that I would imagine, that you can choose your plan, you can choose your doctor, it didn't work out that way, did it? Obamacare.
And we're caping Obamacare alive, We got rid of the individual mandate, the worst part of Obamacare we're keeping it and running it as well as it can, but the premiums are too high. The deductibles are through the roof, it's ridiculous. And we're coming up with Lindsey Graham and all of the folks who are coming up with a great health care plan that if we take back the House, that's why Dan and Greg.
If we take back the House, if we keep the Senate, maybe even increase it a little bit wouldn't be bad and on the assumption we keep the presidency, you're going to have great health care. [Audience chants "More more years!"]
Thank you. We almost had it. We had a man campaigning for eight years to knock out Obamacare and when he voted it, it didn't work out that way, did it? We had it, we would have had it, but we could end up actually with a better plan. Sometimes through adversity, things work out better. We're going to end up with a better plan, you watch. We'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions also, always. You have my word. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 51 years. Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies, straight from the mother's womb right up to the moment of birth.
And if you look at Virginia, the Governor of Virginia, he was even talking about -- Essentially, you would say an execution. He was talking after the baby is born, the doctor will talk to the mother and they'll make a decision as to whether or not that baby lives. This is a radical Democrat idea. And that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term, abortion,  and socialism. They're socialists. The Republican Party, is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream. Everyday, we're making good on the motto: Promises Made, Promises Kept. In fact, we are keeping even more promises, by far, than we made or then we promise.
So many more, so many so many more. You know what we did with respect to people that are very sick or terminally ill, right? Right to Try. [Inaudible] I love the name, Right to Try. We have some of the greatest doctors in the world, labs in the world, hospitals in the world, and we have incredible medicine, that's prohibited from being used until it gets approval and sometimes that approval can take many years, and I said, wait a minute if a person is sick and they've been trying to get this for 45 years?
I said, If a person's sick and maybe terminally ill, why aren't we letting them try this new technology?" And so many things are happening and we did Right to Try, and it wasn't easy, but I was helped by Lindsey and a lot of great people, a lot of great people. All of them helped. Mark helped so much all of them helped, Greg.
We have had tremendous success. We had so many people wanting to help, but it was complicated, believe it or not, because the country didn't want the liability. I said, "You know what you do? You draw up an agreement taking away the liability." said, "That's a good idea." The insurance companies and the drug companies were very unsure.
It's been going on for many years. I got it done. The results have been unbelievable, Right to Try. Things that we never even talked about we're getting done, and you know maybe one of the biggest things is within about a month will have close to 180 federal judges, including appellate division judges. Including two great new Supreme Court justices, Justice Neil Gossage and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who they put through hell.
We passed something that they've wanted to do for half a century. We passed V.A choice so when you're great -- when you're great and honored veterans are waiting in line for three weeks, four weeks, five days, ten days, two months, they go to a private doctor, we pay for the bill and they get themselves taken care of instead of dying, which was happening.
And we also passed, V.A. accountability on behalf of our great veterans. That means when they treat our veterans badly, and they wouldn't have done it in primetime, I could tell you. But when they treat are sick and troubled veterans badly, we can say, "You're fired." It's called V.A accountability. That's another one they've been trying and in all fairness, the unions made it very tough.
Civil service made it like almost impossible. Everyone said, "You'll never get it done." We got it done. I want to thank the Republican Senate. I want to thank some incredible people in the House of Representatives. And Kevin, I want to thank you, because that was a great job you did on that one. That was a great job.
Thank you. Kevin McCarthy.  We've achieved record funding for the U.S military $700 billion last year, $716 billion  this year, $738 billion dollars -- and you know, I'm a big believer in budgets, but we had no choice. We had to rebuild our military with all that's going on today with China, with Russia, with radical Islam.
With everything that's happening. We had to do something and you know budgets are fine. I love budgets and we'll get to that, don't worry about it, but we had to rebuild our military was totally depleted. It was totally depleted, and now we have beautiful new F-35s, F-18s, new ships, new missiles, new rockets.
We have new everything. I came back with Admiral Brown, the United States Coast Guard, and some of the other folks, and they were saying that the new Coast Guard cutters -- How good a job has the Coast Guard done during these hurricanes? And I said, "Admiral, how good are the new Coast Guard cutters?" He said that, "They're the finest in the world, sir.
We have the fine --" and they had all the broken equipment that they had to keep going on a shoestring. They have brand new Coast Guard cutters. We had to do it, we had to do it. There's always time for the other, but we had to do it. We've rebuilt our military, we've taken care of the great people that work in our military.
We gave them a raise, a beautiful raise they were so entitled to, and I also got other NATO members to pay an additional $100 billion  over the last year and a half that they weren't paying. They were delinquent. We're supposed to protect them and they don't pay. I say you can't do that. You can't do that.
You've got to pay. NATO. Now we're finally making immensely wealthy countries pay the cost of their defense, we're negotiating with a lot of them. Think of it. We have these immensely wealthy countries and they're paying for a fraction of our costs to defend them. How did that happen? And you know what the biggest excuse is when I go to them and I'll say, "King you got to pay." or "Mr. prime Minister, you got to pay" or "Mr. President, you've got to pay." You know it's costing us billions of dollars to protect these wealthy -- You know their biggest thing is because I can't understand how we did this for so many years.
Decades, decades. You have been defending all of some -- I won't mention names because I don't want to embarrass anybody.  [Crowd cheering] Forget it. Some of the wealthiest countries in the world and when I say king, president, prime minister, queen, no matter what I say -- You know they say? But nobody's ever asked us to do that before.
That's the only excuse, because I said, "Why would we do this?" Why are we defending you you're immensely wealthy? You compete with us on trade, we have lousy trade deals that were renegotiating many of them and, ultimately all of them. "Why are we protecting you, Mr. President?" Well, well, I don't know I don't know, but you know what their answer is? Because you've always done it. That's not a great answer.
So we're taking in billions and billions, but I got $100 billion and the secretary general of NATO, Stoltenberg, is my biggest fan. He said, "Until President Trump, you had to see the data cost of spending was going like this, and ours was going like this." We were defending many countries that treat us very badly on trade and very unfairly.
We were defending them and now it's changing around,  $100 billion, they're not happy, and then I read where Obama is more popular in Germany than Trump. He's got to be. I'm making people pay their bills. He's got to be. You know the day that I'm more popular than him, I'm not doing my job. The big star.
They like him more in Europe than they like Trump. I think they should, hundred billion dollars more they're paying to protect America's security. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. We paid them $150 billion for that piece of work. I withdrew it and we put sanctions all over the place and they're a much different country and let's see what happens, but I can tell you that I like to get back to business because they're not doing very well.
When I came into office, Iran was a real terror, 18 sites of confliction, and they were behind every one of them in the Middle East, and who knows could have been elsewhere, and I said we're not going to do it. A hundred and fifty billion dollars, President Obama paid, 1.8 billion in cash, whoever saw a million dollars piled up as a promotion in hundred dollar bills?
It's a lot. It's a big -- Now take a million dollars and make it $1.8 billion in cash. I'm actually more impressed with that number than $150 billion, if you want to know the truth.  One point eight billion dollars in cash and we got taken to the cleaners, so I terminated the deal. And I recognize Israel's true capital and open the American embassy in Jerusalem, which every President said they were going to. And I also approved for Israel, the Golan Heights.
And if you really think about it, I said to people, "What's more important, the Golan Heights or the capital of Jerusalem by moving our embassy there?" He said, "Neither, sir What you've done in Iran is more important than both of them." I said, "You know, I guess you're right when you think about it." So we've done a good job, all of us together.
As a movement, we've done a great job for Israel. For years you watch as your politicians apologize for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of North Carolina. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing, you, it's true.
Not about me, it's about you. It's about your family, your future and the fate of your country. That's what we did in 2016. They came from the hills and the valleys. They came from the cities, they came from all over the place and people were saying, these fakers back there, they were saying, "What the hell is happening?" But I knew it was going to happen because we go out and we'd see these rallies, the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, ever, ever, ever in politics, ever in politics.
A vote for any Democrat in 2020, and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina, is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream. We are entering this campaign with the best record. The best results, the best agenda and the only positive vision for the people of North Carolina and I've said it, and I say it loudly and proudly, "I don't believe, there's been any President or any administration that has done more in two and a half years than we have as a group, than we have.
I don't believe so. When you add it all up, nobody's done what we have. Our first task is a giant victory. Tomorrow, tight here in the great state of North Carolina, with your support tomorrow, we take the first steps to firing Speaker Pelosi and winning back the House in 2020. We need everybody to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, and get out and vote for Dan Bishop and get out and vote for Greg Murphy.
You got to get out tomorrow and vote. Together, we will lift millions more from our horrible,  horrible situations that have developed over the years. Look at what's happening to Democrat-run cities. every single one of them. We're going to lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity.
With your help, we will elect more Republicans to Congress to create a safe, modern, fair,  and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with the four beautiful words: Made in the USA. Phone made in the USA. If you want, Made in America, I don't care.
What do you like better, made in America or made in the USA? Go ahead. Wait. Ready? We'll go made in America then made in the USA? What do you like better made in America? Made in the USA? OK. [Audience chants USA] So I think we know that answer. So in 2016, we had, in my opinion, the greatest phrase in the history of politics: Make America Great Again, right?
Now we're within moments, hopefully, of having despite what you heard a few weeks ago, maybe we're heading they go like, "Please, please. Let there be recession, please." they're willing to give up their results because they think it'll help them win the election. They're not going to win the election.  Don't forget, we're doing this and still fighting the unfairness of China and other countries on trade.
What happens when that gets fixed and other things get fixed? We're -- we're setting new records and we're fighting trade deals and we're fighting military deals that run fair to our country. Think what happens when it all gets fixed? We have ourselves a country that's going to be so strong. But we had a phrase: Make, right?
Make America Great Again, the best. I think it was maybe the greatest, 2016, but we've done a lot and now they're very close to setting a new --  I think it's the 118th time that we will have set a new record with the stock market, right? Many, many times. Many, many times. I can't be sure that media, but it's a lot.
OK. I always have to preface it because you'll do headlines. Headlines, "Trump didn't tell the truth." Oh, they love it. So I always--  I've gotten extremely cautious, so he had the greatest phrase of all time. I think even the fake news media would agree, Make America Great Again, MAGA, MAGA country, Make America great Again.
OK. Now, now, we've largely -- we still have a year and a half, a little bit less. Can you believe it? Like, can you believe it? I stood in the White House with the first lady that first night and I said, "Wow look at this. That's the bedroom of Abraham Lincoln. You have to see this, it's so perfectly done, and so the way it was, that's the bedroom of the great Abe Lincoln.
I mean, honey, can you believe this?" That was the first night and now in less than a year and a half, the first term will be over. Think of that.  I announced today that we got the soccer World Cup. That's a big thing. Who else is going to do it? But it's -- we've got a problem, it's in 2026, Johnny Infante, who is a great guy and we announce it in front of the press and 2026, and I said, "Well, wait a minute under the normal rules, I'll be out in 2024." so we may have to go for an extra term.
[Crowd cheering] Oh, they go crazy. They go crazy. Tomorrow, you're going to see headlines, Trump wants an extra term." I told you, I told you he wants -- He wants an extra term, ladies and gentlemen, we told you, we told you he's a dictator, we told you. No, no. I'm only kidding. I'm okay, but we actually have the World Cup, it's the biggest sporting event in the world, and we got it and that's great we're working it. Also with Mexico, Canada giving them some of the games, we're going to have a great relationship with the World Cup.
It's a big deal. Really. Great Bob Kraft helped me doing with Patriots people. Great. Tom Brady had a pretty good game the other night, right? And how good a coach, whether you like it or not, I know you're North Carolina, but how good a coach in all fairness, right? His Coach Belichick. How good is he? How good is he? I know you want to be cool, but he's pretty good, right?
We have to appreciate genius, we all like genius, but we're going to achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending within ten years, the AIDS epidemic in America. That's shocking to hear that, but we can do that. We're going to do that. Definitely. Incredible the strides that we've made.
We will defeat the Democrat effort to drive up the cost of houses, cars, health care, and education by liberating Americans from the endless push for job-killing, soul-crushing Washington regulations. As an example, we're trying to get the car companies to give a little bit of extra energy and they'll be able to build a car that consumers can buy, which will be better than the car they make today and you'll save $3,500. Think of that.
It'll be safer, it'll be better. You could save $3,500. It'll be less costly. And we're going to try and get that done. And then they will forcing you to buy light bulbs that cost a fortune. So I signed something, a couple of days ago, that gives you the right to continue to use the incandescent light, and I don't know about you, much less six months.
I don't know about you, but I don't know, I'm not a vain person. I know I have no vain people, especially these incredible ladies in the front. But I look better under an incandescent light that these crazy lights that are beaming down on. Like you know, somebody told me that, as you know, they're much more expensive bulbs and for what you say, but they said that if a bulb breaks, it's considered almost like a waste site.
It's a very big, the bulbs, the new bulbs, they're very dangerous with all of the gases and all, and I said, "Well, what's the point? What are you saying?" Well, we're saying if we continue that production they can buy whatever they want to buy, but you're going to save a tremendous amount of money and you're going to have a life, that's better, and there is a big danger In fact they have labels: Don't break this bulb.
What are you going to do? Are you going to throw it away? I promise I won't break it. On the new one, so you're going to hopefully by the new ones, but you can buy the old ones too, and you can save a lot of money and you can even look better. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms.
Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together, as one America will be one united nation. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. Thank you Lord, for we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life.
We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way, like you. We believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the words of our national motto: In God We Trust. It'll stay there.
We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who cross the oceans, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, put a man on the moon, and build the most exceptional country in the history of the world. We are great Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to you.
With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. I'd like to fight a little bit less, but these people, they just don't stop. They just keep coming at you in waves. They are, unfortunately, not the best people and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
We're going to keep on winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.  America is thriving like never before. We may have, right now, the greatest economy in the history of our nation, and ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make America wealthy again.
We will make America strong again, with joy. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. I'd like to fight a little bit less, but these people, they just don't stop. They just keep coming at you in waves. They are, unfortunately, not the best people and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
We're going to keep on winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.  America is thriving like never before. We may have, right now, the greatest economy in the history of our nation, and ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make America wealthy again.
We will make America strong again, with joy. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
Hello, Florida. Hello, Florida. We love you, Florida. And I'm thrilled to be back in this great state, the great state of Florida, with thousands of hard-working American patriots. It's an important time in our country. In just six days, the people of Florida are going to send Rick Scott to the United States Senate... and Ron DeSantis will be your next governor.
Rick and Ron. Before going any further, I want to take a moment to address the horrific shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. It was terrible. Eleven Americans were brutally murdered in an evil, anti-Semitic attack. Yesterday, I traveled to Pittsburgh to meet with the families and first responders.
And I especially want to thank Rabbi Jeffrey Myers. He was terrific. He was terrific. Fine man. We grieve for the families of the fallen, and we send our eternal gratitude to the law enforcement officers who sustained severe injuries taking down the gunman. They were incredible. They were incredible. They were incredible.
Could've been -- as bad as it was -- and it was bad -- it could have been far worse. They were unbelievable, and they got there fast. We pledge our resolve to remove the vile poison of anti-Semitism and so many other problems from our world, and we reaffirm our unbreakable solidarity with the Jewish people.
Thank you. Yesterday's visit to Pittsburgh was about coming together as a nation to comfort and to heal. After this day of unity and togetherness, I came home and sadly turned on the news and watched as the far-left media once again used tragedy to sow anger and division. [Audience chants CNN sucks] Sadly, they took a small group of protesters, far away from where we were, because we could not have been treated better, the first lady and myself, but we're representing the presidency.
And they did everything in their power to try to play it up and push people apart. That's what's happening. They're pushing people apart. It was fake, and it was make-believe, what they said. I came home, looked forward to seeing it, and it was sad. And when we talk about division, this is a big part of the division right there.
The far-left media has spread terrible lies and stories about the Trump administration and the tens of millions of people who make up our great movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country. The greatest! The greatest. The greatest movement in the history of our country, and they don't even refute that fact.
It is possibly the greatest political movement anywhere. I can't think of any place else. It's because of you. The movement is you, and it's about you. Not me. It's about you. I am proud of the fact that my administration has boldly revitalized our nation's historic bond with Israel and moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.
And remember, many presidents have promised to do that, many, many, many presidents. "We are going to move the embassy to Jerusalem," and then they don't do it. The reason is, it is not an easy thing to do. I've done it. And by the way, the embassy is already built. It's already open. And it came in $1 billion less than people thought.
They should like that. They should really like it. We've taken aggressive measures against the terrorist groups that seek the slaughter of innocent people all around the world for lots of different reasons. It's terrible. We've taken unprecedented action to confront the regime in Iran, and we have ended the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear catastrophe.
And Iran is a much different country today than the country that started off at the beginning of our administration almost two years ago. We have forcefully condemned hatred, bigotry, racism, and prejudice in all of its ugly forms, but the media doesn't want you to hear your story. It's not my story. It's your story.
And that's why 33 percent of the people in this country believe the fake news is, in fact -- and I hate to say this -- in fact, the enemy of the people. The left-wing media doesn't want to solve problems. They want to stoke resentment. It has to stop. They believe that progress isn't good for profit or for whatever reason it is they're playing their game.
Our movement is about safe homes, great jobs for every citizen. Our movement is about love for our fellow Americans. Our movement is for everyone and belongs to anyone who wants to build a better future. You can do it right here in the USA. Right here. Just look at the amazing things that we have all done working together.
The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years. More Americans are working today than at any point in the history of our country. More -- think of that. How do you lose that debate when I'm up against one of these people that we're seeing and watching? Oh, I hope one of them gets that nomination.
When you say more people are working today than at any point in the history of our country, I think the debate is over. Hispanic American and African American poverty have reached all-time lows. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all achieved their lowest levels in recorded history.
We have eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any other administration, no matter how long it went. We did that quickly. We passed a massive tax cut, biggest tax cut, for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. And the Democrats want to raise your taxes substantially.
Remember that. Remember what Nancy Pelosi said: We will raise your taxes. And I'm trying to say, uh, is that good politics? I don't think so. But she really believes it. They want to raise your taxes. And all that we've built, it's very fragile. Somebody can destroy it pretty quickly if they don't know what they're doing.
We are taking care of our veterans. We are taking care of our military. And we will soon be more powerful than we have ever been before, our military. Our military is being rebuilt at a level that nobody can even believe. New planes, new rockets, new missiles, new ships. New satellites. Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, and America is winning because we are finally putting America first.
[Audience chants USA] But everything we have achieved -- and it's monumental -- is at stake in this election. Democrats want to erase our prosperity and reverse our progress. In less than one week, Americans will go to the polls in one of the most important elections of our entire lives. Although, I will say, not as important as 2016, but... I'd like to say, but not really.
Republicans want strong borders, no crime, no chaos, and no caravans. Democrats want open borders, and they want to invite caravan after caravan into our country, which brings crime upon crime. A vote for Democrats is a vote to liquidate America's borders. And it's a vote to let meth, fentanyl, heroin, and other deadly drugs pour across our borders, drugs that take the lives of over -- think of this -- over 70,000 Americans a year.
If you want high taxes and high crime, vote for the Democrats. Vote for the Democrats. [Audience chants Build that wall] And the wall is being built. We just spent $1.6 billion on a big section. Another $1.6 billion now. We have another $1.6 billion coming, but we want to build it all at one time. All at one time.
Not in little pieces. But we're getting prepared for the caravan, folks. You don't have to worry about that. Getting prepared for the caravan. And they've got a lot of rough people in those caravans. They are not angels. They are not. You saw what happened two days ago with the Mexican military and the Mexican police.
You saw what happened there, how tough the opposition is. We're tougher than anybody. We're tougher than any force. And we're probably going to have to be, unfortunately. I tell them turn back, and they're not going to be released. It's called catch, but we take the word release out. We're not releasing anymore.
It's catch. We have no choice. If you want low taxes and low crime, vote Republican. This election is truly a choice between results and resistance. How about their whole theme, obstruct, resist. What the hell do you get out of that? Resist? They want to resist. Great, resist. It's the only thing they're good at. They resist and they stick together.
That is true. They stick together, great. But that's about it. They have bad policy, bad politicians, but they do stick together. Between greatness -- and this is really an election between greatness and gridlock. It will be gridlock. And it's a choice between an economy that is going strong and setting records at every level and the Democrats, who are going absolutely crazy, folks.
They're going crazy. So you have to go out on November 6th or sooner -- who voted? Who voted? Oh, wow! Everybody voted already? No kidding. Let me see it again. Who voted? Then what the hell am I doing here tonight? Goodbye. What am I doing here? Boy. That's like 100 percent of the people in this room voted.
All right. Let's just enjoy ourselves, OK? I can skip to that. But actually you see all the people back there? Looks like -- looks like the Academy Awards. I call them the Academy Awards. And by the way, I have to say this. You have some very good people also as reporters and journalists. I know some incredible people.
You have some that are not good at all. You have some very good people, too. I want to say that. You have some very good people. We are honored to be joined tonight by many great Florida Republicans, including a man who's so great to me on television. This guy is special. He was a great businessman. Now he's a great congressman, Francis Rooney.
Where's Francis? I love him when he defends me. He's brutal. He gets the job done, right, Francis? Thank you, man. Thank you. Another man, great, great talent, young, handsome, going places. You talk about defending, he's fantastic. Matt Gaetz. Thank you, Matt. Great job. These guys on television are very proficient, I have to be honest with you.
A man who people love and the state loves, a congressman who's done a fantastic job, he's always there, works so hard, Gus Bilirakis. Gus? Thank you, Gus. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Along with the next congressman from Florida's 17th district, Greg Steube. Greg? Greg Steube. And your state's chief financial officer, he watches all that money that pours in, Jim Patronis.
Jim, thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, Jim. You know, they don't tell me where these people are sitting. You've got -- you've got -- this place has thousands of people. I sort of have to guess. I sort of have to guess. But we get it right. We're especially proud to be joined by the next United States senator from Florida, Governor Rick Scott.
Great guy. Governor Scott is doing a truly incredible job, leading your state's Hurricane Michael response, all of the hurricanes, all of the problems. He takes the problem and he turns it into an asset. He is an unbelievable talent. He works harder than anybody. Always calls up with good news. "Yeah, I've got this one taken care of, that one taken care of." He's a real -- he really is, he's a talent.
And we send our prayers to the Florida Panhandle, people we love, and everyone in that storm's path. That was a giant -- that was a tornado that was 50 times wider. That was brutal. We went there. We visited. We had houses ripped off their foundations. And even the foundations were gone. Nobody's seen anything like it. Together we will ensure that Florida comes back stronger than ever, already happening.
And you remember our hurricane last year, the response that we gave was A-plus, and Rick and everybody in Florida did a phenomenal job. Rick and Ron also worked closely with us to pass legislation to build a reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee. That was an expensive one. To clean Florida's water. That's a big one.
That's a big one. Those two guys worked hard on that. Rick Scott is one of the best governors in Florida's history. He's considered one of the best governors -- maybe the best governor, but one of the very, very top, elite governors anywhere in the country, and if elected, he will keep the Florida boom in full swing.
Rick Scott always delivers for the people of Florida. Rick Scott, please come up. Rick?
Good evening! Are we not honored to have President Donald Trump in Florida? We want him every day. So let me tell you about your president. In the last year, we've had two hurricanes. Every day he calls me. Every time I call him, he says, "What do you need? I'll do anything you want. Take care of your citizens." There is absolutely nothing that I have asked from Donald Trump with regard to these two hurricanes that he hasn't come through.
Let's give a big round of applause for your president. So, Hurricane Michael was horrible. About 30 mile wide, 150 mile-an-hour winds, 14 foot of storm surge. But guess what? People from all over this country came down here and took care of our citizens. They brought food, water, generators, tarps. They did everything to take care of our citizens.
And you know what? They didn't say, oh, what party are you? No. They said we're going to help every citizen of this state, just like your president did. They did -- everybody came down. We can do -- we can do the exact same thing in Washington. We can bring this country together and make this country the place where all of us can be proud of. Let me tell you what this president's also done.
He said he wants every child, every adult to live the dream of this country. I grew up in a very poor family. I lived in public housing. He wants every child like that to have -- have a great education and their parents to have the best paying jobs. And he's doing it every day. Now, let me tell you about my opponent.
And here's your choices. Senator Bill Nelson cares about one job, his. In Florida, in the last eight years, we've added one million, six hundred thousand private-sector jobs, not government jobs. Senator Bill Nelson has been in office for 42 years. He voted against the Trump tax cuts. He's voted for higher taxes over 300 times.
In the last eight years in Florida, we've cut taxes almost 100 times, $10 billion. Senator Bill Nelson, when he took office, the national debt was about $600 billion. It's now almost $21 billion. Thank you, Senator Nelson. In Florida, we've cut our debt by $11 billion -- almost $11 billion in eight years.
Senator Bill Nelson is for catch-and-release. President Trump and Rick Scott, we want a secure border. We want you to be safe. The choice is clear. You want somebody that's going to go to D.C. and do what we've done here and make sure we cut taxes, like President Trump has done, cut regulations, like President Trump has done, and work on paying down debt.
Now... I have a 6-year-old grandson. He says, Grandpa, how are you going to win the election? I said you get more votes than any other person. It's as simple as that. Everybody here can vote tomorrow if you've not voted. We have early voting in every county in this state. Vote. Vote. Vote. Take a friend, get out to vote.
We can win all these elections. We can make sure that we -- make sure that we continue to turn this country away -- around. Thank you for the opportunity to here. Thank you again, President Trump, for all you've done for our great state.
Great job, thank you. I know him well. He wants to go right now back to work. He wants to work. Rick is running against far-left Democrat Bill Nelson. You know that. A vote for Bill Nelson is a vote for Chuck Schumer. Remember this. Chuck Schumer -- and they want to enact the radical agenda of Nancy Pelosi.
During his three decades in Congress, Bill Nelson has developed one of the worst voting records of any lawmaker. Nelson voted against your tax cuts. He voted against virtually everything that we want, including regulation cuts. He voted against Neil Gorsuch and again Brett Kavanaugh. Figure that one. Bill Nelson voted against Kate's law, and he voted to support deadly sanctuary cities that release drug traffickers and violent predators into Florida communities because Bill Nelson wants open borders.
We don't want open borders. Our country can't survive with open borders. If you want a leader who shares your values and who will fight for your families, you need to get out and vote for Rick Scott. Now, I'm really talking about the people on television, because everybody in here has voted. All the people on television, vote for Rick Scott.
Finally, I'm thrilled to introduce the next governor of Florida, a great gentleman, Ron DeSantis. Ron is a veteran and he's a patriot, and he will continue the incredible jobs boom. And boom, you just look -- look at what's happening to this state. This is my state, also. Look at what's going on in the great state of Florida.
He'll continue what Governor Scott began. Florida's economy is one of the hottest anywhere in the nation, anywhere in the world, and Ron DeSantis is going to keep it that way. Ron will keep your taxes going way down, jobs going way up, and he will always support our veterans, our military, and our law enforcement.
Ron, come on up.
Is southwest Florida Trump country or what? I'm proud to say that of the candidates running for governor, I'm the only one that has worn the uniform and served in our military. I'm the only candidate that ain't going to raise your taxes here in Florida. And I'm the only guy that can credibly say I'm not under investigation for corruption by the FBI.
As governor, I will protect our economy. And that means we cannot raise taxes. We need to continue to recruit businesses here. And I believe Florida can boom like never before. Andrew Gillum wants to raise taxes by 40 percent. That will cost jobs, cost us business, stop the investment into Florida. We can't let that happen.
I'll also stand by our men and women in law enforcement and protect Florida's communities. Andrew Gillum is a failed mayor. In Tallahassee, they've had the highest crime rate in Florida under his leadership. And last year, they had the highest number of murders in the history of the city. He signed a pledge attacking our men and women in law enforcement saying police and prisons have no place in justice.
He cannot keep Florida safe. And you need to come out and vote for me, because I will protect Florida's communities. Andrew Gillum wants to abolish ICE. He wants to have open borders. He would allow sanctuary cities and would turn Florida into a sanctuary state. I can tell you this... As governor, I will never allow Florida to be a sanctuary state.
We will protect your health care. Andrew Gillum is hanging out with Bernie Sanders. And what they want to do... They call it Medicare for all, but if you read the fine print, every senior loses Medicare or Medicare Advantage under their plan. They get dumped on a single-payer government system. If you get insurance through your business, that is taken away from you by force, and you are thrown onto a single-payer government plan.
Government -- government has no right to take away the health care benefits that you're earning. You deserve to keep it. As governor, I will work with the president and with the Trump administration to make sure that we get the resources we need to clean our water and clean our rivers and protect our way of life here in the state of Florida.
Now, Andrew Gillum can't work. He's running on impeaching the president. For what? You know, I don't know what he's thinking about impeachment. I mean, this is a guy that took bribes from an undercover FBI agent, took money from a lobbyist, did favors for the lobbyist. Maybe we should impeach Gillum as mayor of Tallahassee.
[Audience chants Lock him up] As governor, I will look to the president for -- he made promises to you when he ran that he would appoint solid constitutionalists to the U.S. Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals, and he has delivered. We have two great judges on the U.S. Supreme Court and more appeals judges than any president at this point in history.
And as governor, I will appoint solid constitutionalists to our state Supreme Court. We will end judicial activism in Florida once and for all. As governor, I will protect your Second Amendment rights. So it's an honor to have the president here. I want to thank him for what he's done for our economy. I want to thank him for what he's done to fight terrorism.
I want to thank him for what he's done for our military, which is stronger than ever. And as an Iraq war veteran, I want to thank him for what he has done to stand by our veterans. So we need your support between now and November 6th. Come out, pull the lever for Ron DeSantis, and I will protect Florida's future for a generation.
Thank you. God bless. Thank you. Thanks.
Wow. So Ron is running against a radical socialist who wants to turn Florida, frankly, into Venezuela. Get used to it. It's what's going to happen, too. Andrew Gillum wants to take a wrecking ball to one of the most successful economies anywhere in the world, the Florida economy, with massive tax hikes, crippling regulations, and a socialist health care takeover that would destroy your state.
Andrew Gillum wants to throw open your borders to drug dealers, human traffickers, gang members, and criminal aliens. And Gillum supports deadly sanctuary cities. He wants to abolish ICE. And he signed an extreme left-wing pledge that supported an end to all borders. Oh, that's great. That's what we want.
Let those people pour right in, folks. Let them come enjoy you on your front lawn. Andrew Gillum is too extreme for the people of Florida. You're not going to -- you're not going to take it long. And he's also weak on crime. On Andrew Gillum's watch, there were more murders last year -- you just heard it -- I think Ron probably saw my speech, but everybody knows it -- than any year in the history of Tallahassee.
You know that. And Gillum is weak on corruption. Tallahassee is among the most corrupt cities anywhere in the United States. Is this really what you want in the state of Florida? Is this really what you want? And I have to tell you about Bill Nelson for a second. So he's running against our great Rick. I'm in Florida a lot.
I have a lot of different things in Miami and Palm Beach, and I stay here. And it's a great place. But I never see Bill Nelson. I never see -- I was commenting on it the other day. I'm here a lot. I never see Senator Nelson ever, until six months before the election, and then you don't see anybody else but him.
You never see him. And he's just a vote for Schumer. He will always 100 percent vote for Schumer. He will never, ever vote for what we want. So Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum would be a disaster for Florida's economy, your jobs, your safety. The people of Florida are going to reject socialism and elect Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott.
A majority of Democrats on the ballot for Congress have already signed up to support a socialist takeover of health care that would destroy Medicare, eliminate Medicare Advantage for nearly 2 million Florida seniors. The Democrat plan is especially unfair to Hispanic Americans. One out of two Hispanic seniors is enrolled in Medicare Advantage.
You know that. Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors, who have earned it. And they've paid for it. They've been paying for it. And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. Always. Always. The Democrat plan also raids Medicare to fund benefits for illegal aliens at the expense of our seniors.
People of Florida, as we speak, the Democrat Party -- do you notice, I don't say Democratic -- I say Democrat, because that's their name, even though the other flows so much nicer. The Democratic Party. They should change their name and send me a check for giving them some free advice. But it's not the Democratic.
It's called the Democrat Party -- is openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders. You see what's happening right now, because they won't give us any votes on border security and overwhelm our country. And they want to sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and the right to vote.
And the Democrats want to continue giving automatic birthright citizenship to every child born to an illegal alien. Even if they've been on our soil for only a matter of seconds, hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant children are made automatic citizens every year because of this crazy policy, and they are made instantly eligible for every privilege and benefit of American citizenship at a cost of billions of dollars a year.
That's what it costs, billions. Back before the Democrat Party went crazy, they also opposed this practice. Harry Reid said no sane country, quote, no sane country would grant automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. That's what he said. That's before he went crazy. Under this policy, anyone who breaks into our country and has a child, the very next moment, that child would be made a citizen for life.
Great. This policy has even created an entire industry of birth tourism -- big business -- where pregnant mothers travel to America to make their children instant American citizens. Congress has never passed a law requiring birthright citizenship for illegal aliens, and the Constitution does not -- I say that to the media -- does not require it -- read it -- because illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
[Audience chants USA] Democrats also support the insane policy of catch-and-release, which has created our border crisis, our certainly helped. A Democrat victory on Election Day would be a bright flashing invitation to traffickers, smugglers, drug dealers, and gang members all over the world, come on in. That's what you're saying.
Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. And the Republican Party will always stand proudly with the heroes -- that's what they are -- heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, and law enforcement. And I saw that yesterday in Pittsburgh. And, yes, we will finish the wall.
It's moving along. We want to do it fast. Want to do it much faster. But watch what we do. Instead of building a little bit of a wall down there very quickly, watch. You watch. Watch, watch. It's going to be very interesting over the next week. If you want safe communities and strong borders, vote for Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis.
This election is about safety, and it's also about prosperity. Florida manufacturing jobs are growing at their fastest rate ever recorded. Earlier this month, I announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. USMCA, folks, USMCA. Great deal.
We opened them up. We've also taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices. And we're winning very big. We're winning. Very big. After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, thank you very much. And every day, it's promises made, promises kept.
You know that. In fact, one of these fine people said recently, you know, actually, he's promised certain things and he's fulfilled more than he's promised, which is true. Which is true. We passed veterans' choice. For many, many years, they were trying to get it, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor when they have to wait on line for weeks and weeks and weeks, get sicker and sicker.
Can you imagine -- can you imagine -- we passed veterans' choice. They've been trying to get it passed for 44 years, and I got it passed two months ago. Now they see a line when they go to their doctor, we pay the bill, and, boy, it works out great. They're very happy. And the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans has to be accountable.
In other words, you're fired, get out. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military. And I know most of you don't care about this that are in the military, but we gave our great warriors their largest pay increase in over 10 years. I know you don't care about that.
And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force. So important. That's where it's at. It's all about space. Very soon, it's going to all about space. And we're going to be stronger, as we are almost everywhere now, stronger than anyone by far.
Together we've made extraordinary progress, but we are just getting started. If you vote Republican this November, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes, which is what we've been doing. We will protect Medicare. And we will protect, just like I've been saying since that first debate, we will protect your Social Security.
With all the pressure, we have protected your Social Security. Remember I made that promise. Remember everybody else said, oh, we have to do something. I've been saying we're going to protect your Social Security. Guess what? We haven't let anyone touch it. We will continue to confirm judges who will interpret our Constitution as written.
And we will fully secure the border. Watch. We will pass Kate's law and stop sanctuary cities. We will stop catch-and-release. We will end visa lottery. How about visa lottery? Pick a name, pick a name, come on into the country. And we will end chain migration. Birthright citizenship, you know all about it. We will keep the criminals, the drug dealers, we will keep them all out of our country.
We will get rid of all of this. We will end finally birthright citizenship. It's costing us so many billions of dollars. People didn't want to bring it up. I said we have to bring it up. Everybody knows. Everybody knows for many years. But for years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. You now have a president who is standing up proudly for America.
We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Florida. And we are standing up very proudly for our great national anthem. You don't hear too much about that anymore, do you, folks, huh? You don't hear too much about it. But to continue our incredible momentum, you must go out and vote for Rick and Ron.
Loyal citizens like you help build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people, which is true. It's been your movement. This has been your movement. We stand on the shoulders of brave Americans who crossed the oceans, tamed the wilderness, secured our independence, won two World Wars, and put a man on the face of the moon.
Not bad. American patriots defeated fascism, vanquished communism, delivered millions into freedom, and Americans built the greatest country and the most powerful military in the history of the world. These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud American heritage.
We did not. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never, ever, ever back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory.
We are one people and one family with one glorious American destiny. We all share the same home, we all share the same heart, we all salute the same flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. And I want to thank all of the people of Florida. This is such a big group. And outside, we have more. And a lot of people were just saying, "Don't bother coming." This is such a great honor.
Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Florida. Thank you.
Hello, Indiana. It is great to be in Indiana. We had a big victory here not so long ago. Big, big victory. Big one. A big one. And I'm thrilled to be back in the heartland. And you want to see something special? Take a look outside at the thousands and thousands of people that wanted to get inside. You got lucky.
You got lucky. This is an incredible time for America. Jobs are soaring, wages are rising, optimism is skyrocketing, and more Americans are working today than ever before in our history. Tomorrow the people of Indiana are going to send Mike Braun to the U.S. Senate to keep America's economic boom surging full speed ahead.
He's a great guy, very successful guy, wonderful guy. Nobody knows, he went to Harvard Business School and did well. I shouldn't mention Harvard, but I have to, because at least it shows he has very high aptitude tests, right? And that's -- you know, that's OK. That's a good thing. He's a smart guy, and he's a great guy.
And he loves the people of Indiana. He loves Indiana, Mike Braun. Republicans have created the best economy in the history of our country. This is the single best economy in the history of our great country. And it's the hottest jobs market on the planet Earth, but everything we have achieved is at stake tomorrow, everything, because they can take it apart just as fast as we built it. But I don't think that's going happen based on what I'm seeing all over the place.
If the radical Democrats take power, they will take a wrecking ball to our economy and to the future of our country. When you enter the voting booth on Tuesday, you will be making a simple choice. A vote for Republicans is a vote to continue our extraordinary prosperity. A vote for Democrats is a vote to bring this economic boom crashing down very rapidly.
The Democrat agenda will deliver a socialist nightmare. It's what it is. The Republican agenda is delivering the American dream -- optimism, the American dream. In the last month alone, we added another 250,000 brand-new jobs. They couldn't believe it, the fake news media, they were very upset. They were very upset, very, very -- they were very upset when they saw those numbers.
And it couldn't have come at a better time, Friday, what a beautiful time. Election on Tuesday, comes on Friday. And by the way, that's despite those numbers, two unbelievably powerful vicious hurricanes which always devastate job numbers, despite that, 250,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate is now at the lowest level in more than 50 -- five-oh -- 50 years.
We have created 4.5 million new jobs since Election Day. Oh, wasn't that a nice day? Remember that? Was that a nice day? Oh, that beautiful November day. We had a lot of happy -- were you all happy on that particular day? Well, they were among the highest ratings in the history of television. That still didn't make them happy.
They were miserable. That's the only time they got great ratings, and they felt badly about it. And we've lifted 4.3 million Americans off of food stamps. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment have all reached the lowest levels in the history of our country. And we passed -- despite the fact that it was said it could not be done -- a massive tax cut, largest in history, for Indiana workers, for the entire country.
And we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. And to protect your rights and freedoms, we overcame the Democrat smear campaign and confirmed the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And just in case you haven't seen it, one of his accusers came out on Friday and said she never met him, he didn't do the horrible thing that she said, she never met him, it didn't happen, she was lying.
She was lying. It was a false accusation. It was a false statement. A disgrace. And I remember -- I remember when that phony statement came out, a lot of people were saying he must immediately abandon, he must -- and do you know what, for 10 years, everybody said Brett Kavanaugh -- I didn't know who he was.
But for 10 years, the intellect, the scholastic ability, the legal genius. I was hearing his name for years, that they said he'll be on the Supreme Court. I said, who is he? Who is he? But I'd hear it for years. And think of that. This woman came out and said she made up the story. [Audience chants Lock her up] And they got to look at the other ones, also, folks, because take a look at the other ones, folks.
You know, when I gave him -- gave him a little phone call, could I meet you? I met him at the White House. Really clean-cut, nice guy. I said, Judge -- at that time, he was judge, had an incredible record. Not a problem in his whole life. Best student, Yale, Yale Law School, best marks, best everything. Right?
Never problem, perfect family, beautiful, great kids, wife, everything perfect. I said, Judge, I want to nominate you for the United States Supreme Court. And he said, sir, this is the greatest honor of my life. We shook hands. And I said, Judge, let me just tell you, this is going to be a piece of cake.
You are so good. Your academic record, your record at home, your record in every way. You are going to go through so fast, it's going to be so easy. And he said, thank you. And then he sat down and a lot of bad things started being said. And I'll tell you what -- it was, I'll tell you what, it was a disgrace.
One guy, you know who that is? The great Vietnam hero, right? Great Vietnam hero. Right? You know all about that, except he never went to Vietnam. [Audience chants lock him up] And he stood up and he said, I don't want any lies, I only want the truth. This guy lied for 15 years about his -- Da Nang, right?
Da Nang province. When I was climbing up the hill with Da Nang, I was climbing up the hill. And my soldiers were going down left and right. He never saw Vietnam. He was in the Reserves. Not bad, Reserves. He never saw Vietnam. He was climbing up the hill. Bullets left and right. My buddies going down. And then he wants honesty.
This is the crap we have to put up with? Then you have Dianne Feinstein. Dianne Feinstein. Right? Todd Young's friend. Senator Cornyn of Texas looked at her, said, did you leak? And she got scared. You know, he's a pretty tough guy, right, Tom? Really, I mean, this was unbelievable. Did you leak? Senator Cornyn, did you leak?
And she goes, uh, what? Did you leak? Did we leak? We went through this. The worst body language any human being has ever used or seen. In other words, she leaked. She leaked. And that's just the beginning. What they did is a disgrace. Oh no. Are they good ones or bad ones? Good or bad? Good or bad? Hey, look at the cameras, everybody.
They're finally turned. Look. They're finally turned! They're finally turned! [Audience chants USA] The cameras turned like a pretzel. Did you see that? They had no angle, but they won't turn to show these huge crowds. They never want to show the crowds. You have to see. You have to see. I just left Ohio.
You want to see? It was incredible. This is incredible. Outside is even more incredible, because it's more people. But they never show it. They keep it right trained on my face, which I don't like, and about five people behind me. Somebody there is going to be a star. I don't know who it is. You may have better seats, but you know what?
Honestly, somebody is going to be very famous back there. But they don't show the crowds. Could you spin the cameras around, please, and show the crowd? Come on. They don't turn them. Look. They don't turn them because they're fake news. They're fake news. They don't turn them. They're fake news. They never turn them.
My wife always says, how was the crowd? I say, didn't you see it? No, they kept it right on your face. They never move your face. They never -- and they do that because they don't want people to see how big the crowd is. They don't want that. Now, President Obama, he had... No, he was in Miami or someplace.
And in the big basketball arena that seats 18,000 people, he had 1,000 people. Seriously. And not person that I saw reported that. If I had one empty seat right up in that corner, right there, hello, folks, right there, if there was an empty seat, that would be a front-page story that we're not drawing the crowds anymore.
Right, Coach? Hey, Coach. No, they don't turn the camera. In fact, the first time -- that's about the first protester I've seen in a long time. And it's the first time I've seen the cameras like pretzels, boom, right up into that. Because you see, they think that's a bad thing for us to have a protester.
And tomorrow you will have on television protests. Was it one person or two? It was one person. The contrast in this election could not be more clear. By the way, is there anything like a Trump rally? Governor! [Audience chants USA] Democrats produce mobs. That's what they're doing. But we're winning. Republicans produce jobs.
Very simple. Very simple. A vote for any Democrat tomorrow is a vote to hand over power to cryin' Chuck Schumer. You know cryin' Chuck, right? Remember when he... He never cried before. I've known him a long time. I never saw him cry, but that was an appropriate moment. Right on schedule. Nancy Pelosi. The legendary Maxine Waters, a real genius.
And their extreme job-killing agenda. That's what it's for. They want to raise your taxes, the Democrats do, restore crippling regulations, shut down your new steel mills, take away your health care, and put illegal aliens before American citizens. That's what they want. Democrats are inviting caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to pour into our country, overwhelming your schools, your hospitals, and your communities.
If you want more caravans, if you want more crime, vote Democrat tomorrow. If you want strong borders -- you see what we're doing, we got the worst laws because they won't give us the votes. If you want strong borders and safe communities, no drugs, no caravans, vote Republican. Get him out of here, please.
Get him out. Out! Out! Go home to Mommy. Go home to Mommy. Oh, look at the cameras. Look, the cameras are right on him. The cameras are right on him, folks. All right. Can we have our law enforcement take him out of here, please? You know, the funny thing about this stuff, though? There's a guy who's a weak person with a weak voice.
Nobody hears him. But our guys are all going crazy, like this. Our guys, actually, right? They're disturbed, but it's what -- that's OK. We love our guys. What can we do? We love them. We're thrilled to be joined tonight, and he just spoke a little while ago, but he's been a friend of mine for a long time, an American football legend who truly knows winning, my friend, Coach Lou Holtz.
Lou, thank you. Lou. Lou. What a coach. And what a great guy he is, too. Thank you, Lou. We're also grateful to be joined by many terrific Indiana Republicans, including a man that has done an excellent job. You know, he followed a very tough act, Vice President Mike Pence, right? Very tough act. And he has done a phenomenal job.
In fact, Mike was telling me what a great job Governor Eric Holcomb has done. And we also have here someplace, it's tough to find him -- boy, it's tough -- they should tell me, like, where are they -- look at this place, I'm supposed to find somebody. A great person, a friend of mine, helped us so much in every single thing we passed, and nobody's done better than we have in the first two years of office, that I can tell you.
Senator Todd Young. There he is. Great person. Hard worker. Hard worker and a winner. Thank you. Thank you, Todd. Great job. And also Congressman Jim Banks. Big help. Thank you, Jim. They're great people. They've helped us with a lot. If you don't want to be saying the words, "Ladies and gentlemen, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi," for the next two years... ... you got to get out tomorrow and you have to get out.
You got to get -- Jim, are you ready? You've got to get out, vote for Jim, vote for all of those great congressmen. Vote for all of those great congressmen and women. They have great congressmen and women. And again, something's going on, folks. Something's going on. Let's see. Maybe I'm wrong. There was something going on two years ago.
There was something going on, and I felt it. And I feel it again. So I want to introduce three people that probably you've heard of. And, you know, I just left Ohio, and I said, I will never imagine the word beautiful when referring to a woman. I will never do it. No man in this room will ever again say a woman is beautiful, right, because it's not politically correct.
But I have a daughter who's very smart. Her name is Ivanka. And she's here. Ivanka, come up.
Wow. Hi, Indiana. We love you. We really love you. And we are fighting for you each and every day. And tomorrow, we want you all to turn up and help us fight back, so we continue to keep this rolling, this moment of opportunity unlike anything this country has ever seen. Truly, it's a golden era of opportunity.
My father mentioned the job numbers. But people are coming off of sidelines into our workforce, unemployment is at a record low across all categories. It's never been a better time to be an American worker. And that can't stop. So get out and vote tomorrow. And thank you for your love. We return it. Thank you. [Audience chants USA]
And she's a very nice person, I can tell you. And very smart. She went to the Wharton School of Finance, and they say she was very, very smart. [Audience member yells "and beautiful"] Are you ready? He goes "and beautiful." No, I don't say that. Don't ever say that. I have two other great women with me. You've never heard of them.
They're very shy and retiring. They want to keep it that way. Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Thank you, Indiana. You'll have to forgive Kellyanne and I, we're maybe a little speechless. We're not used to friendly crowds. Thank you. It's an honor to be here with so many incredible people. Mostly it's an honor to be with you, Mr. President. Thank you for giving us the privilege of a lifetime to work in your historic administration and to do incredible things and literally change the course of our country.
A lot of people know me in my official capacity, and it's one of the greatest honors of my life to serve in your administration, and one of the most important jobs I'll ever have. But the greatest job that I'll ever have and the greatest title I've ever have is that of a mom. And that's why... And that's why I work for this president, because I care about my kids' future and I care about the future of our country.
And I want somebody that I know will protect their future, protect this country, and make sure that they have the best America possible. And that's why we're going to keep making America great again. Thank you so much, Indiana.
We all over her. Mr. President, thank you. Ivanka, Sarah, I love me some Hoosiers. So let me just say in my personal capacity, because this election is very personal to me, Joe must go. Get him out. [Audience chants Joe must go] That sounds -- it sounds like about 13,000 people saying that, Mr. President.
You don't need to be a pollster to know how to count. This place is filled to the rafters. This president's policies have helped the job creators, the job holders, and the jobseekers. And ladies and gentlemen, if you think your vote doesn't count, if you think that it doesn't matter to have a small majority in the United States Senate, you did not live through the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.
It matters. Elections have consequences. And your vote tomorrow is so incredibly important. Yeah, that's right. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being here. But you have to do one more thing for us. You've got to get everybody you know out to the polls tomorrow or it doesn't matter. You got to get them out.
Grab a friend. Get a colleague. Tell them it matters. We need to keep this going. Mr. President, I just am reminded of the 2016 crowds. It looked an awful lot like this. It's starting to feel an awful lot the same. But my favorite thing, Mr. President, they'd say, we see -- we see all the crowds. We see the crowds.
But will they vote? No, they stood in the rain for four hours, they stayed overnight just to be here, but they're not going to vote. So you tell me, but will you vote? God bless you, Indiana. God bless the United States of America. Go Mike Braun. God bless the United States of America. [Audience chants USA]
So I just saw them standing there, and I said, let's get them up here, right? That's good. That was a good job. But it is true. I didn't say it in a long time. They used to say -- I remember, I was in New Hampshire making a speech. And they had people -- it was like 25 degrees below zero, they're freezing.
They were there for 24 hours. Their clothing, I don't know who makes it, but it must be the greatest in the world, right? And then the media was saying, yes, they waited for 24 hours in subzero temperature, but will they vote? To take -- the vote took about 15 seconds, right? Will they vote? The answer is, they voted in New Hampshire.
They voted all over. And here we are, folks. Here we are. Tomorrow, the people of Indiana are going to elect an outstanding man. He will be a great new senator to work along with Todd. A vote for Mike Braun is a vote to keep your jobs going, to keep your wages going up, and to take care once and for all -- and we've done a really good job for it. You look at the Wall Street Journal today, their editorial, they say we haven't gotten the credit for what we've done to health care, including, by the way, getting rid of the worst part of Obamacare, the individual mandate.
We're taking care of health care. It's a vote to keep your family safe and to keep criminals, traffickers, and drug dealers the hell out of our country. We want them out. Mike's opponent is an extreme liberal Democrat named Joe Donnelly. Now... He's gone rogue on the Democrats. He's gone rogue because now he likes Trump a lot.
He loves my border policy. They got to come in through a process. They got to come in legally. I don't know if he said the wall yet, but he will be saying that pretty soon, I suspect, Todd, right? And all of a sudden, he's talking about what we've been talking about. Now here's the problem. There's one problem.
We'll have the election tomorrow, and on Wednesday, he'll be totally against us. He'll never vote for us. He will never, ever vote for us. That's what's the problem. A number of them, I'm popular in a lot of states, can you believe this? Really popular. I mean, we won -- we won states by more than 42 points, can you believe it? So when you guys think you're doing well, I did well in a lot of -- and all of a sudden, we see these senators veering to almost exactly my words.
I say, did they turn Republican? But what they do is, on Wednesday, they go back to who they are. And we'll never get a vote from Joe Donnelly. When we come in with the health care, when we come in with whatever we want, we will never -- because it's obstruction. Their whole campaign is named resist. Right?
Resist. We don't want to resist. We want to get things done. We want the opposite. So a vote for Joe is a vote to put Schumer in charge of the Senate and to put Dianne Feinstein in charge of Senate Judiciary Committee. Remember, Joe Donnelly voted against your tax cuts. And he joined the Democrat mob in voting against Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
You know that. Despite what he's saying this week, just happened. I was surprised, but not that surprised. Donnelly also supports open borders. He voted to give free welfare to illegal aliens. And he sponsored Dianne Feinstein's bill to expand catch-and-release. Joe Donnelly was rated the least effective Democrat in the entire United States Senate.
That's why they call him sleeping Joe. No, but look at this, look. You got a chance to put Mike Braun there, smart, tough. He sleeps about four hours a night, or less. He's going to work like hell for you, and he's going to really -- he doesn't care. He's given up a lot to do this. He's given up a lot. Given up a lot.
And Joe wakes up primarily when Schumer calls. Yes, sir. This is the way I want you to vote. Uh, yes, sir. If you want a senator who will always be loyal to the people of Indiana, he'll do what's right, vote tomorrow. Get out tomorrow. You've got to do it. Mike Braun, he will be a great senator. Mike, come on up.
Fort Wayne, Allen County, the heart and soul of conservatism in Indiana, that's what you are. You know, the president is right. I'm doing this, I think, for the right reasons. Not the pay and the perks. Not to nestle in, in D.C. I signed a term limits pledge. It is to help somebody that's shaking up Washington.
[Audience chants drain the swamp] So when my wife and I decided -- he's right, we lived out east for two years, saw the light, moved back to our hometown, been there ever since. She's had her business in our downtown for 40 years, I've had my own for 37. And you learn a lot in the real world. These folks that go there and do it for the pay and the perks nestle in, nothing gets done.
I remember back to November 2016. We all watched with amazement that year when this new guy from out east came onto the scene, took on the establishment. Yeah. I'll never forget, I did go to bed at a quarter after 2 and I do get by with five to six hours of sleep, but went to bed, got up the next morning about 5:30, quarter until six, turned the tube on, and see President-elect Trump.
So you've all done it before when you heard great news. I'm jumping up and down. I knew my wife had about another hour to go. I went up, got her out of bed. We were both hooting and hollering. What a big day. So this is a rare opportunity, with -- we've got tax reform that's already come down the pike. We're sharing those benefits with our employees.
We raised 401(k) benefits, lowered family health care plans by $1,400 bucks a year, took on the health insurance companies 10 years ago. My employees have not paid a nickel more for good insurance in 10 years. That's what you're going to get out of me. We finally got an opportunity. We need more reinforcements from the real world, people that have done something.
You're going to see in the next two years, and once the president gets re-elected, there are going to be more people like me to come on board. So, do this for me. Family and friends, get them out to vote. Help me send Joe Donnelly to the early retirement he deserves. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Wow. He's going to be great. He's going to be great. And, Todd, I think you like very much the prospect of working with that man. Right? Todd Young. Thank you. Thank you, Todd. That will be a great team. That will be a great team. If Democrats gain power on Tuesday, one of their very first projects will be a socialist takeover of American health care.
[Audience noise] Get them out, please. Get them out. [Audience chants USA] I don't know what it is about Indiana, but I'm not surprised. I haven't had one of these things happen in a long time. And now I have three of them tonight. That's Indiana for you. That's Indiana. Going back home to mama. The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than 360,000 Indiana seniors who depend on it. Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and who, by the way, paid for it. They did pay for it. And Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
Please remember that. Democrats' plan to destroy health care also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants. Not something that Indiana is really thrilled about. Your taxes will triple. Your taxes will triple. As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and overrun our country, and they want to sign them up for free welfare, free health care, free education, and most importantly, the right to vote.
They want them to vote. They want them to vote, folks. That's what they want. That's a big deal, so that people like Todd Young will never see the Senate again. That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen, I have a feeling. There's only one way to stop this Democrat-led assault on America's sovereignty.
You have to vote Republican tomorrow. You have to. Illegal immigration costs our country more than $100 billion every year. Think of that, $100 billion. And that's a very, very low number. I'm using that low number so they can't criticize me. Because I said -- If I said, seriously, $210 billion, they -- you know, if I'm off 15 cents on the high side, they'll say Donald Trump exaggerated the number.
So I go real low and I cut it in half, $100 billion. And that's a real low number. And that's more than double the budget of Indiana, Tennessee, and Georgia combined. And I mentioned those two other great places, because we have two big races in Georgia, right? You know that, right? Big one. We have a big one in Georgia, big one in Tennessee.
Marsha Blackburn's great. Right? Brian. You're going to have a new governor. And he's going to be great in Georgia. You got have it right. We got to get it right to make our country great again, we have to get it right. We're going to get it right. These dangerous policies drain our Treasury and they threaten our communities.
Nearly 100 percent of the heroin in the United States enters through the southern border. People don't know that. Along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, the majority of meth, and a substantial portion of deadly fentanyl. These drugs destroy the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, and 70,000 Americans a year die from these drugs.
Last year alone, our brave ICE officers, who the Democrats want to fire... They're great. They're tough, they're strong, and they love our country, I'll tell you that. And they take a lot of abuse. Arrested more than -- listen to this -- 127,000 illegal aliens with criminal records, 127,000 with criminal records... ... including those charged or convicted of approximately 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes, and 1,800 murders.
Can you believe it? And did you see what I put on this week? Did you see? Not the rough guy screaming at the judge that he's going to kill everybody, but the second one wearing a hat. And he wanted to come into our country, but he asked for a pardon. And they said, oh, the announcer, the young woman that was doing probably some kind of a reporter, and she said, oh, you want a pardon?
What is it for? And they have it in Spanish. Murder. She said, what? Murder? Murder? You want a pardon for murder? This was one of the people in the caravan, wants a pardon for murder. Or attempted murder, to be exact. No, we don't want that. We don't want that. We're making our country great again. We don't want that.
You can't make a country great if we're going to take some other country's problems, other countries that we pay hundreds of millions of dollars to a year and then they allow caravans to form. That's not going to go on too long, I'll tell you. Not going to go on too long. But the Democrats want to abolish ICE.
They want America to be a giant sanctuary city for drug dealers, gang members, and MS-13 killers. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary city for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And we will always stand with the heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, and law enforcement. And you do have great law enforcement in Indiana.
They're all over the place. They're great. You've got great law enforcement. Great governor. Great governor. This election is about safety, and this election is about jobs. For years you watched as we let foreign countries plunder our wealth, shudder our factories, and steal our jobs. But those days are over.
And in case you haven't noticed, our country is respected again. Very much respected. We're respected again. We've added nearly half a million manufacturing jobs since the election, jobs that the previous administration said could never come back. You remember that? Remember we need a magic wand to get them back.
We found the magic wand. And last month alone, we added another 32,000 manufacturing jobs. That's 1,000 new manufacturing jobs every single day. They were never going to come back. They're all over the place. And we have many, many companies coming back into our country. I was with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, great gentlemen.
Just had a big re-election, got a tremendous vote. And he said many car companies -- he gave me a list of the names. I have the -- because I don't want to just hear many. I want to know specifically, which ones are we talking about? Because they do very well with the United States. You know, for years, Japan does very well with the United States.
And I told him -- he's a friend of mine, Shinzo, we have to start talking about this. This is no good. Too unfair. No good. But he said, but we are sending many companies, and it's true. We have companies going to Ohio and Indiana and North Carolina and South Carolina and Pennsylvania and Florida. Big, beautiful car companies, because we like the cars when they're made here, not when they're made in other countries.
I just like them better. They have a better feel. They have a better feel. I like them made in the USA. Remember years ago? Made in the USA. You don't hear that, but you're starting to hear it, because we are bringing back new companies like you've never seen, including Foxconn in Wisconsin. Foxconn. Governor Scott Walker did an incredible job.
I told them, Foxconn, they're friends of mine. Scott, good luck. And I handed it to them. And there are very, very few people -- governors, I think your governor could have pulled it off, actually. There are very few -- I know he could -- there are very few governors that could have taken that big, big, complex deal and quickly made it into one of the most incredible plants I've ever seen in my life.
They make Apple equipment, much of the Apple equipment at the highest level. They make robots. They make things you wouldn't believe. It's like a new age. We brought them into Wisconsin. And they're coming, and many other companies are coming. They're all pouring into our company. They want to be-- they're coming into our country at every level.
They want to be where the action is. And they say it. We want to be where the action is. And this country is the hottest country anywhere in the world. And that's where they want to be. I recently announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal with an incredible, brand-new, U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.
Great deal. The USMCA is a tremendous victory for Indiana farmers, manufacturers, and dairy producers. Everybody in our country is very happy about that deal. And they've studied it closely. We have taken historic action to bring back American jobs by cracking down on China's very abusive trade practices.
But that's going to work out. That's going to work out. Taking in billions and billions of dollars in taxes from China. Never happened before. But they want to make a deal. And that's good, because I like them, and I like their president. President Xi. And we're going to make a deal, I believe. After years of -- but a fair deal.
Fair deal. There's a difference. No bad deals. After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, and we are doing it with American steel. Thanks to our tariffs and tough trade policies, our steel mills are roaring back to life, and you see that all over your state. Here in Indiana, Steel Dynamics has announced a $75 million investment in Columbia City and a $400 million investment in Terre Haute.
And just three months ago, U.S. Steel announced a $750 million investment in a place called Gary, Indiana. Do we have a doctor, please? Doctor? Doctor in the house, please. Thank you. Thank you. OK. Take your time. No problem. Take your time. Doctor, please. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.
Take your time. Take your time. Take your time. That's one of our good fans. Let's just hope everything is fine. Right? We have plenty of time. Plenty of time. [Audience member yells about Obamacare] Thank you, Doctor. Good. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you. We have water right here coming out. Water coming out.
Looking good. Looking good. Looking good. Looking good. Looking good. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you. Great job. Thank you. Looking good. With our great people -- he'll be back in about 10 minutes. That was good. That was good. Thank you very much, Doctor. Every day, it's promises made, promises kept. We have also taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs.
And I want to thank Pfizer, Novartis, and others. We called them. We said you got to reduce the price of your drugs, and they did. They didn't do the increase. So we want to thank them. But prices are coming down now for prescription drugs. We pay more than any country in the world. And there's nothing good about that.
And we've offered new affordable health care plans in Indiana that cost nearly 60 percent less than Obamacare. And they're better plans. And very proudly for our veterans, we passed veterans' choice. We just passed choice, where the veteran has a choice to go to a private doctor rather than waiting on line for days and weeks and months.
And we pay for that private doctor. They've -- they have been trying to pass that for over 40 years. We got it done. We're good at getting things approved. And the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure that anyone who mistreats our veterans can be immediately held accountable. You're fired. Get out.
And we secured $700 billion and $716 billion over two years to fully rebuild the United States military, and we gave our great warriors their largest pay raise in more than 10 years. And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces called the Space Force.
Very important. But I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It was a catastrophe. Doing very well on that front. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Together we have made extraordinary progress. And we are just getting started.
Go out and vote. This is the greatest -- you, you, this is the greatest political movement in the history of our country. It really is. I mean, I don't even think it's close. And if it was, they would be knocking it -- let's see, what was better? Well, I don't think too many were better. This is the greatest in the history of our country.
There's never been anything like this. You could almost say because it's us, the history of the world. What was -- what's the bigger movement than this? And let's keep it going, by the way, tomorrow, folks. Let's keep it going. Two years ago, we shocked the Washington establishment and stunned the entire world when we defied the pundits and the critics, rejected the failures of corrupt status quo, and elected a government that finally puts America first.
It's about time. Every day since the failed, old ruling class have been trying to claw back their way, they've been trying to claw back their way into power. They're not having an easy time. The fact is, I shouldn't say this, because I want to unite. I do eventually want to unite. But the fact is, we're driving them crazy.
We're driving them crazy. They don't know what to do. They're going loco. Loco. That's all right. Hopefully it's going to all come together some day, like a beautiful puzzle. They have been on a shameless campaign to obstruct, resist, demolish, defame, and destroy. True. They have been. It's ridiculous. But you can stop them with your votes tomorrow.
We will not be intimidated by mob rule, because our movement is America's movement. You are moms and dads and sons and daughters, students and workers, farmers and soldiers. You follow our laws, give back to our communities, and raise your children to be strong, upstanding citizens. You are loyal and faithful to your country, and now you finally have a president that is loyal and faithful to you.
For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. You've seen it many, many times. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and it's my honor to do so. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Indiana, and we are standing proudly for our great national anthem.
I am asking every citizen from every party, every background, and every race, color, and creed to reject the Democrat politics of anger and division and to unite behind our proud and righteous destiny as Americans all together. All together, we're Americans. I need you to get your family, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and go out and vote for a Republican House and a Republican Senate and Republicans at every level of government.
And I need you to vote for Mike Braun tomorrow. Devoted citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to where it belongs, with you, the American people. This great state of Indiana was built by tough frontier men and strong pioneer women who braved the wilderness to build a life, a dream, and a home with their own two hands.
They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud American heritage.
That's not what it's about. From the farm fields of Indiana to the big sky of Montana, from the deserts of Nevada to the red rocks of Arizona, from the coal mines of West Virginia to the steel mills of Ohio, and in every city and town across our land, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win.
We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down, and we will never surrender. We will always fight on to one thing. What is that one thing? Victory. It's victory. we will always fight on to victory, because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue.
We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And, Indiana, together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Indiana. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much, Grand Rapids. It's great to be back. Right here in America's heartland. You know that, right? With the hard-working patriots from the great state of Michigan. By the way we are bringing a lot of those car companies back. Remember I told you they are coming back?
They are pouring back in. They are coming back. They are coming back fast. This has been an incredible couple of weeks for America. The economy is roaring. The ISIS caliphate is defeated 100 percent. And after three years of lies and smears and slander the Russia hoax is finally dead. The collusion delusion is over.
The Special Counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction. I could have told you that two and a half years ago very easily. Total exoneration. Complete vindication. You know, it's interesting Robert Mueller was a God to the Democrats, was a God to them until he said there was no collusion.
They don't like him so much right now. The crazy attempt by the Democrat party and the fake news media right back there -- And the deep state to overturn the results of the 2016 election have failed, the greatest election that we've had in a long time may be right from the beginning. [Audience Chants Trump] This was nothing more than a sinister effort to undermine our historic election victory and to sabotage the will of the American people.
This is the one we want. We want ourselves. We want us and that's what we got. We came from all over to vote. They've never taken it away from us, never. Never. Our movement took on the political establishment, the corrupt media and it's never been more corrupt than it is today. And many special interests, that's why they tried to do everything possible to take us out but we are very tough to take out aren't we? Very, very, very.
The Russia witch hunt was a plan by those who lost the election to try and eat illegally regain power by framing innocent Americans, many of them. They suffered with an elaborate hoax. They wanted to destroy a movement like our country has never seen before. That's true. Never seen before. And believe me, if these people thought that that wasn't true, they would be writing it. They've never seen anything like it. Nobody has in this country's history and in most countries histories there has never been anything like what we did in 2016 on November 8. We defeated a very corrupt establishment and we kept our promise to the American people and it's driving them crazy.
Today our movement and our country are thriving. Their fraud has been exposed and the credibility of those who pushed this hoax is forever broken and they've now got big problems. And the harm done to our country -- think of what they've done. Think of the time wasted and yet despite this terrible cloud, this phony, corrupt, disgusting cloud we have done more together in the first two years than any administration in the history of our country.
And this group of major losers did not just ruthlessly attack me, my family, and everyone who questioned their lies, they tried to divide our country, to poison the national debate, and to tear up the fabric of our great democracy, the greatest anywhere in the world. They did it all because they refuse to accept the results of one of the greatest Presidential elections, probably number one in our history.
Many, many people were badly hurt by this scam. But more importantly our country was hurt. Our country was hurt and they're on artificial respirators right now. [Laughter] They are getting mouth to mouth resuscitation. Little pencil-neck Adam Schiff. He's got the smallest, thinnest neck I've ever seen. [Laughter] He is not a long ball hitter but I saw him today well, we don't really know.
There could still have been some Russia collusion. Sick. Sick. These are sick people and there has to be accountability because it's all lies and they know it's lies. They know it. They know it. Jerry Nadler, I've been fighting him for many years. He was the Congressman from Manhattan. I built great things in Manhattan.
I had to beat him many, many times. Now I come here, I have to beat him again. Can you believe? I want every record in the history of the Trump organization. Every single sheet of paper. And what do you have to justify? Nothing. It doesn't matter. We will find something somewhere along the line. A mistake must have been made.
These people are sick. Sick. Every single deal. Every single paper. All of the Democrat politicians, the media bosses bad people. The crooked journalist, the totally dishonest TV pundits and by the way they know it's not true. They just got great readings. By the way their ratings dropped through the floor last night.
Did you see that? And our friends Tucker, Sean, Laura through the roof last night. And all of the current and former officials who paid for, promoted, and perpetuated the single greatest hoax in the history of politics in our country they have to be -- I'm sorry. They have to be accountable. Just think of. A fake, dirty dossier millions and millions of dollars paid for it. By who?
Crooked Hillary Clinton, the DNC and the Democrat party. Think of it. This is what they used. But they failed. They failed in one way. Can you believe it? Maybe I got lucky. Maybe I got lucky because the fake news they wouldn't put it on. Even they didn't be leave it. Think of it, they spent millions of dollars and the deal was they get it published or printed all of these horrible lies, all now totally exposed as fake.
They were going to get it printed just before the election and they couldn't get any of the media to print it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. You never know. You never know. You lose a few vote and that could be the difference but they wouldn't print it so I will tell you on that score I give the media a lot of credit.
It came out after the election and everybody had a big, fat yawn. [Laughter] And I heard about Russia. I'd be running, I'd be hearing -- they'd say something about Russia. I'd say Russia, what does that have to do -- ? This went on. Little -- and then all of the sudden I hear were you involved with Russia?
I say Russia? What the hell does Russia have to do with my campaign? It's true. Russia. Russia. You know I go up to Wisconsin where she didn't go, she was told you know many, many years, decades, since a Republican one although Bill Clinton said he was in Wisconsin and you'd better get up there, there are a lot of signs up saying Trump Pence, a lot of signs.
A lot of those signs. You'd better get up there darling. And they said no, no, no. Don't worry about Wisconsin because you know Wisconsin the pollsters say we're doing great. They don't come to a place called Michigan. Have you ever heard of Michigan? Michigan. And Bill Clinton said you know I was in Michigan, you'd better get to Michigan.
It's not looking good. They have so many of those damn signs. Every place I look they have the sign on somebody's lawn. You'd better get up to -- know, Michigan hasn't been lost in decades by the Dems. By the Dems. Hasn't been lost. And if you remember this was my last stop. This was it. And I'll never forget this was a spur of the moment because I heard crooked Hillary and Bill, Barack Obama and Michelle -- they were all headed here, right, at the last moment.
They had a tiny, little crowd and I had I'd like to say more but I can't have more than this because every seat is gone and outside you have 25,000 people. And I remember leaving and I said so she's got 500 people and I had 32,000 people including the people outside. I will tell you we have more tonight because outside we have even more than we did then.
And I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning so it's now election day. In fact I actually said am I allowed to do this? It's 1 o'clock in the morning. I had made six speeches and when I heard she was coming I said you know what, what the hell. [Laughter] So it was spur of the moment, last second. We called and we had 32,000 people including all of the people outside.
She had [Inaudible]. I said so let me explain. Let me ask. So she's here at prime time 730, I'm here at one in the morning. She has 500 or 600 people, I have 32,000. Can you explain why am I going to lose Michigan? Why? Why am I going to lose Michigan? Why am I going to lose the great state? I was asking my people.
I get home at 4 o'clock in the morning and I told our great First Lady, soon to be first lady -- and she's doing a great job. They love her. I said you know I have this incredible crowd and I didn't start speaking until 1 o'clock in the morning. I said how the hell could I lose Michigan and guess what we didn't lose Michigan.
And you know what, we didn't lose Wisconsin either. And the fact is we won a lot of places that night. We won Pennsylvania. We won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. We won Florida. We ran the East Coast. We won Iowa, you'd better believe Iowa. We love Iowa. We won. We won a lot. We won a lot. Well, we 306 to 223. Would you say that's good?
I say that's good. Because of here. Remember they said there is no way -- . The day of the election I'm saying you know this is pretty lousy. It's all fake news. You know they are trying to put it in your head. They go there is no way to 270. In other words I needed 270 to win. There is no way for Donald Trump, I wasn't President.
Then, I was a little short of President There is no way on CNN for Donald Trump, remember the red board? It was so red; the red was killing -- they were dying. There is no way for 270 for Donald Trump. It will be a very short evening for Donald Trump there just is no way and they were right. We didn't get 270. We got 306. But in this country -- [Audience chants Four more years] But in this country, we cannot criminalize political differences, political differences.
We do not abuse the law enforcement and intelligence power to target our political opponents when they spy on me. Whoever heard of this? They spied on me. They spied on our campaign. Who would think that's possible? The single greatest political hoax in the history of our country and guess what? We won. It's a beautiful thing.
It's a beautiful thing. We love to win. They tried to take something great away from people that came from all over. I always say, they came from the valleys, they came from the mountains, they came out of the damn rivers. I don't know what you were doing in the river but they came from the cities. They came and they came and they didn't even know these people existed.
They are hard-working. They are successful, they are the smartest people, they are the toughest people, they are the most loyal people. They are. They are the smartest. Remember this about yourself. You know I always hear the easily, the release. Well, I always said they said it. I said it here my last night.
I always say they say the easily. They are the elite, I am not. Well, I have a better education than them, I'm smarter than them. I went to the best schools, they didn't. Much more beautiful house, much more beautiful apartment, much more beautiful everything. And I'm President and they are not, right? And then they say the elite, the elite.
They are not elite, you are the elite. We are the elite. I get a kick. I hear so and so the elite. Then you see this guy, like this little schlepper, this is elite? I'm not elite. This is elite. We are the elite. You are smarter. You are sharper. You are more loyal. You are a hell of a lot tougher. A hell of a lot tougher.
So we can't have two different standards of justice in our country. One where the left wing radical establishment can get away with anything they want. But you know, I have to tell you. I said it last night, we have some great, great friends in the media too. You look at Rush and Sean -- And Laura and Steve and Ainsley and Tucker and Jeanine.
Jeanine is back, going to be back on Saturday night. Jeanine, right? And even Greg likes me now. Greg. He started a little slow but he likes Trump. But we have a lot of great support. We really do. We have a lot of great support. Far more than you think but where we really have the support are the voters that pull that handle or whatever the hell they are pulling they are pulling it for us. So the Russia hoax proves more than ever that we need to finish exactly what we came here to do. Drain the swamp.
The Democrats have to now decide whether they will continue defrauding the public with ridiculous bullshit -- Partisan investigations or whether they will apologize to the American people and join us to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, bring down the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs which we are doing incredibly, help us fix our broken trade deals which are coming along really well.
We have our team right now in China. They just arrived. China. China. We've gone up, they've gone down but we want them to be healthy. We want them to be happy and healthy. China. And by the way we are building the wall as us -- , we are building that wall. Building -- We are building that wall. [Audience chants build that wall] We had to go down a little bit of a different path but that's okay.
National emergency it is. And if you look at the border and you look at the hundreds of thousands of people that are invading or at least trying to invade our country you would know that we needed and we are building it. And we are building it a lot faster than anybody would -- and better, and better. It's better.
It's faster and it's less expensive. And it's also much more beautiful. And we are building it very rapidly. It's moving along and we renovated vast amounts of wall. A lot of it was in bad shape, we renovated it for 25 cents on the dollar. That's okay, too, right? That's good too. The fake news doesn't want to give us any credit for renovation.
They say even if you rip it down and build a brand-new wall where the wall was, they call that a renovation. That's not a renovation for me. That's not. They do anything they can to -- you're right. Shifty Schiff. They do whatever they can do sort of make it look not so good. We are really doing well but we have a problem.
Our country has never been better economically and people are trying to get in and they have to come in legally and they have to come in based on merit. Based on merit. Despite all that we have been forced to endure every day we are working and fighting and winning. Remember that because we are making America great again and we are making a great for all Americans, all Americans.
And it's getting to be that time, very important. MAGA country. You heard the other day. How about in Chicago? He said -- He said he was attacked by MAGA country. Did you ever hear that one? I don't know -- . May be the only time I've ever agreed with the Mayor of Chicago. That's a terrible situation. That's an embarrassment not only to Chicago.
That is an embarrassment to our country what took place there. Remember that. But they are looking at it. So we are delighted to be joined this evening by some really incredible people. People that love you. Members of Congress. Bill Huizenga. Where is Bill? Bill Huizenga. Where is he? Where the hell is he? You didn't get a very good location.
[Laughter] You didn't get a good bill. You did not get a great location but we have some news. John Moolenaar. Thank you, John. And Jack Bergman. Thank you, Jack. So here's something good. You ready? In honor of those guys and some of your other representatives and all that we think are fantastic we have some breaking news.
You ready? I don't know. Can you handle it? I don't think you can handle it. I support the Great Lakes. Always have. They are beautiful. They are big, very deep, record deepness, right? And I'm going to get in honor of my friends full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative -- Which you have been trying to get for over 30 years.
So we will get it done. It's time. It's time. It's time. You been trying to get it over 30 years. I would say it's time. Right? Also and as you know this one, we have already pretty much locked up, I'll say locked up. You all understand that because we are very close to getting started on the beautiful new Soo Locks that people have wanted to build for a very, very long time.
So we are very close to finishing that one off. And by the way don't let your new Democrat Governor -- or don't let -- Don't let any of our people that find us all of the way now that we have it take credit for it. Okay? Don't let it. Don't let it. You are too smart for that. We are also joined this evening by the Speaker of the Michigan House Lee Chatfield.
Thank you, leave. Thanks, Lee. A person who is doing a fantastic job GOP Chairwoman Laura Cox. And a woman you know very well, she headed up Michigan. They said she was wasting her time, Trump is never going to win Michigan. I said but I'm going to bring back your auto business. Remember? And I did, and I did.
And when we won, I said who is that woman? I want to see her and we put her in charge of the RNC, Republican National Committee. Ronna McDaniel. Ronna. And a friend of mine, he used show but he's very rich he shouldn't be shy. He's one of the biggest builders and real estate people in the world, one of the biggest owners of property.
I shouldn't introduce them because you guys will like him because he's a big owner of property but you own -- you own property, he just owns more of it than you do. [Laughter] And he's a great guy and he's been with me from the beginning, Stanley Chera. Stanley. Those big beautiful buildings in Manhattan.
You know those big beautiful buildings? He owns it. Stanley, how much did you make this month? [Laughter] Stanley is a great guy. Been with us all. He loves you and he's been with us from the beginning and we've had a lot of people with us. We've had people you wouldn't believe we've had a lot of support.
In the last two years we've embarked on an unprecedented economic revival. Unprecedented. America is now the hottest economy anywhere on the planet Earth. There's nobody close. Since our election when the stock market is up almost 50 percent. You are looking like geniuses with your 401(k)s, right? Your wife or your husband is saying darling, you're such a great investor.
How are we doing? We are up 67 percent. Oh, darling, you're so brilliant. [Laughter] In your whole life you've been criticized by her or him but all of the sudden they think you are the single greatest investor. Thank you, Donald. [Laughter] By the way if you want to see those 401(k)s and all of your stocks and all of the things that you own, you want to see them deflate put a good socialist in this position.
Go get yourself a good socialist. You'll see some deflation. You'll see a nice deflate of your stocks and your bonds and your 401(k). We have created since my election 5.5 million new jobs. Nobody would have believed that was possible. Including 600,000 brand-new -- remember, this couldn't happen. You need a magic wand.
Brand-new manufacturing jobs. Well, how did that happen? We were going to have any new man -- it was going down 600,000 and it's going to be increasing by a lot because you have a lot of companies pouring into Michigan and your other great states. A lot. More manufacturing jobs in fact were created in 2018 than in the year in more than 21 years.
That's not bad. That's not bad. And that's not even one of our better statistics. That's actually like at the bottom of the pack. Do you believe me? After years of stagnation wages are rising fast. Do you remember I use to say that people made more money 21 years ago? All of the time and they had one job then they did -- this is two, three years ago, right, than they did working two and three jobs now.
True. But now wages are rising. You have your choice of jobs like I got choice for the veterans, we also got choice for people wanting jobs. So wages are rising substantially for those people. You are doing great but they are also rising most quickly for the lowest income Americans. First time in decades.
And here's a statistic that I love because blue-collar jobs recently grew at the fastest pace in more than 30 years. Whoever thought, right? 30 years. And unemployment has reached the lowest rate in 51 years and soon it will be in the history of our country. 51 years. And to me very important, you remember I use to say what do you have to lose?
What do you have to lose, right? And I got criticized. You shouldn't say that. I said well, it's true. It's unfair. So importantly to me African-American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment and unemployment among disabled Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country.
And you remember in the last election they said Donald Trump will not do well with women. I said really? I said really? No. All of the fake news they said you will not do well with women and maybe they didn't want to say they like me to be honest. That I can understand. And then the election came and they said whatever happened to the fact that he wasn't going to do well with women because we did really well with women.
Right? Right? Remember when I was sitting back a couple of them were trying, remember one of the true killers she was crying not from happiness. But we did great with women. We did great with women and I think we are going to do better with women now because you know what? I produced. Because women filled more than 60 percent of all new jobs created last year.
60 percent. Think about. 60 percent. So that means the men better get moving, folks. You are falling behind. The women are -- they are beating you pretty good men. Get going. The women got 60 percent of all of the new jobs. I mean that's an incredible number. We've cut the greatest number of regulations in two years in the history of our country.
Not for two years, in the history of our country. That's one of the things helping us with the jobs. And the United States people don't even believe this, it all happened very recently is now the number one oil and gas producer in the world. Number one. Number one. And by the way Russia is not happy about that but they are fine.
They are doing just fine but they are not happy about that. If Hillary got in you wouldn't have that stat, I can tell you right now. You would be doing wind, windmills and if it doesn't -- if it doesn't blow you can forget about television for that night. [Laughter] Darling, I want to watch television. I'm sorry, the wind isn't blowing.
I know a lot about wind. I know a lot about wind. We passed massive tax cuts, the biggest in the history of our country. And very importantly for those people with small farms and businesses we got rid of the death tax or the estate tax. So now when you leave your farm or small business to your children under the assumption that you like your children, some people don't. Some people say I wouldn't leave it to them under any circumstances.
I can't stand my kids but for those of you that do which I assume is hopefully a vast majority you don't have an estate tax to pay, they don't. So they can take over your farm, they can take over your business, they don't have to mortgage it to the hilt and then the bank comes in five years later takes it away from your kids.
No tax. We eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate penalty. The most unpopular part and we are going to hopefully in the court -- in Texas you heard we won the case, now it has to be appealed and then we will go to the United States Supreme Court. We have a chance of killing Obamacare. We almost did it but somebody unfortunately surprised us with thumbs down but we will do it a different way.
You know what, we will do it a different way but we got rid of the individual mandate where you were forced to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to buy bad healthcare. Okay? Not too good. So we are going to get rid of Obamacare. And I said it the other day, the Republican Party will become the party of great healthcare.
It's good. It's important. And we have created new options to help Americans purchase affordable health plans all across state lines. You now have options you would have never had. The Democrats are pushing socialist government-run healthcare that bans private healthcare for 180 million Americans. Now think of it. A lot of you have private plans and they are great.
They are great and you want that. They want to take them away. That's not going to work. I don't think that's going to work too well. Republicans want you to have an affordable plan that's just right for you and by the way you can use your doctor, remember that? That was a lie. 28 times, 28 times he said that was a lie.
You get cheaper premiums in much lower deductibles. The deductibles and Obamacare are so high on average $7000. You don't get to use it unless a really great tragedy hits and then you don't really want it because you don't give a damn about your deductible, right? You will be in a position where you say who cares about the deductible.
Let's see if I can live. We believe that no one in America should be bankrupted by health care cost and that's what's happening with Obamacare. And remember this because it's very important and I'm speaking now for the Republican party, we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always.
Always. My administration has also begun the bold initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs and in 2018 drug prices saw their first decline in 46 years. First time. First time. And they will be coming down a lot but this is the first time in 46 years that prescription drugs came down. Even Stanley likes that because he needs plenty of them.
And then we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our amazing veterans. Our amazing veterans. They have been trying to get VA Choice for over 40 years. They couldn't do it. I got it. We signed it six months ago. Now instead of waiting online for one day, one week, two months people that were okay but not feeling well, wait so long that they become terminally ill.
There was no reason for it. Now they go outside, they see a private doctor, we pay the bill, they get better quickly. And for 46 years VA Accountability you couldn't fire anybody in the VA. We had sadists. They took advantage in so many ways of our great veterans. They were rough, they wouldn't have hit them in prime time by the way, not in prime time.
In prime time they would say okay, I don't want to touch you. I'm not going to play. They took advantage of people that are our great heroes that protected us and you couldn't fire them. They stole, they robbed. You couldn't fire them. It didn't matter what you did you couldn't fire them. Called accountability.
We passed seven months ago today we passed VA Accountability. You heard our vets, you stole from us. Guess what, Bill? You're fired. You're fired. Get out. You're fired. And to give former prisoners a second chance I proudly signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law. They have been trying to do that for so many years.
So many years. Very unfair. And by the way some of the people that most supported it are the most conservative people you've ever seen. Both, both sides. Very bipartisan believe it or not for a change. But while we are pushing and pursuing all of these commonsense policies to advance the common good for our citizens Democrats are pushing a cynical and destructive agenda of radicalism, resistance.
Resist. Resist and revenge. Revenge. What do you think of their signs resist? What the hell? Let's get something done, right? Resist. Resist. Resist. Isn't that weird? You know you are looking to have a parade that's called resist. You say what the hell does that mean? No, no. We want to do legislation. There are so many things we can be doing together.
The Democrats are now advancing an extreme $100 trillion government takeover called the Green New Deal. But I'd rather not talk about it tonight because I don't want to talk them out of it too soon. [Laughter] Because I love campaigning against the Green New Deal. I want them to make they do a big part of their platform.
No more airplanes, no more cows. One car per family. One car. You're going to love that in Michigan. Hey, how do you like the idea of one car per family? You know, I don't think one car per family in Michigan plays too well. Do you agree? Right? Not too well. And it's got to be of course an electric car even if it only goes what, 160 miles?
What do you do, it's 160 miles? Darling, where do I get a charge? Where do I get a charge, darling? No. We want to have a lot of cars per family. We want people to lead a great life and we want people to make those cars and we want all of these companies to keep coming to Michigan and all of the other great states and building those [Inaudible]. And we had a problem because when they didn't want the airplanes they were saying well, how do you get to Europe?
Nobody knew. How do you get to Australia? Nobody knew but they are working on it and then they were interviewing this woman from Hawaii, the Senator. The one that was so vicious about Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. Remember? By the way, do we love Justice Gorsuch and do we love Justice Kavanaugh?
She was so vicious to both and these are great people. She was vicious and they hit her. She didn't know about the Green New Deal and they hit her and she's from Hawaii. What do you think of the Green New Deal? It was just put up by the Democrats. Well, I like it very much but she never saw it. Then they said but you can't fly anymore and she's in Hawaii.
She said but how would I get to my island? They said we are working on some kind of a train system. [Laughter] So she said okay, well then, I am for it 100 percent. It is the craziest thing I have ever seen. They want to rip down all of the buildings in Manhattan and rebuild them. Let's do that. Hey, Stanley, how do you like that idea?
I don't think so. I don't think Stanley likes that idea too much. It's the craziest thing but you know what, let's let them -- . It's like I attack so violently Pocahontas and -- And I knocked her out of the race I guess and I said what did I do that for? It's too early. I've got to start in about nine months from now.
We've got plenty more to knock out, you're right. They just keep coming, don't they? They just keep coming. Before I took the oath of office the United States automobile industry was decimated and it was going down and you people knew it better than anybody else. We lost one in four auto manufacturing jobs over the last few decades.
Think of it, one in four and I think the numbers were worse than that and so do you. But from the moment I entered the White House my first meeting was a meeting with car executives. I said what do I have to do to get your business going? We talked about CAFE standards where they were choking the engines, just choking them and costing a lot more for the cars and we had a great meeting and we worked on it and worked on it. We took historic and dramatic action to save the American auto industry and to defend American auto workers right here in Michigan.
Right. And just in the last very short period of time we have added another 6000 vehicle manufacturing and auto parts jobs in Michigan alone and prevented thousands more from being shipped overseas and from going to Mexico. They can't do that anymore. Can't do that. Can't do that anymore. Sorry, Mexico.
We want them to give us a little more help on the border by the way. You know Mexico has the toughest immigration laws in the world. We have the worst because the Democrats put in things that are so bad, so bad. Catch and release. You catch them and then you got to release them. Think of it. Visa lottery.
You are in a lottery system from these countries. You pick up a name. Isn't that nice? Guess what? Do you think they are giving us their best people? No, they are not. They are giving us their worst people and so would you and so would I. Visa lottery. That's another beauty. We have nothing but bad coming out of those laws but you know the good thing about what's happening, the rush to the border, another two caravans now are pouring up. Mexico could stop them so easy and you know what?
If they don't it's going to cost them a hell of a lot of money honestly because they could do it so easy. So easy. And if they don't and I'm telling you right now we will close the damn border. [Audience chants USA] And I don't know if you know it or not Michigan but Mexico took about 30 percent of your car business.
Not when I was here. When I'm here they are not. It's going the other way. 30 percent and if we close the border that means we are not taking those cars into our country and what does that mean? That means you are going to make more cars right here in the good old USA. That's what it means. Right? Very simple.
It's all very simple. People try and make it too complicated. It's all very simple. One of the gravest threats to the survival of the U.S. auto industry was the job-killing, sovereignty-wrecking Trans-Pacific Partnership. It was going to decimate your industry. That's why one of my very first acts in office was to withdraw our country from that horrible potentially disastrous trade deal.
And stop the offshoring of Michigan jobs. Saved a lot of jobs. That was a disaster. That would have been almost as bad as NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world. NAFTA. That was a beauty. Your empty factories are still all over the place. They still haven't recovered from NAFTA. Well, NAFTA is going to be a thing of the past.
Soon. Or we will just go to pre-NAFTA, that was okay, too. We had a huge surplus with Mexico, then we did NAFTA. We lost over the last six, seven years with Mexico $100 billion. Before NAFTA, we made $40-$50 billion. Doesn't sound like too good a deal, right? So we have now the USMCA and it's very good.
If the Democrats want to raise their hand -- it's a hard thing for them to give us a victory but let's see if they raise their hands otherwise, we go to pre-NAFTA. We don't go to NAFTA, we go to pre-NAFTA. That was just okay with me. That was okay with me. A short time later I traveled to Detroit to cancel burdensome regulations that unfairly harm the motor city.
It was getting decimated. We renegotiated the U.S. Korea trade agreement to double the American auto exports to Korea. We doubled them. They were not happy about it. And to stop the cheap foreign pickup trucks from flooding our market. That's your best market. Do you know why? Because we have a chicken tax.
We have a tariff, 25 percent and that's why it's your best market because they can't come in here and take away your business and take away your jobs. They weren't thrilled but that's okay. Under my administration we live by two simple rules, buy American and hire American. And we are already seeing good results.
Since the election we have created more than 55,000 brand-new motor vehicle and auto parts jobs in our country. 55,000. Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion investment in Michigan including the first new auto plant in Detroit in over a generation. And they are going to be investing in our country $13.5 billion over a very short period of time.
And Ford has just announced a $1 billion investment just outside of Chicago as well as additional $900 million going right here in Michigan. And I've been a little bit disappointed with them because everyone else is coming in but General Motors did just announce a $300 million investment at its Orion assembly plant here in Michigan, right now.
But I'm also fighting with General Motors and the UAW to take swift action on the GM plants at Hamtramck and Warren, Michigan and Lordstown, Ohio. Get the damn plants open. Everyone else is coming in. Get them open now. Right? So with companies like Chrysler and Ford and Toyota and Volkswagen all investing heavily in America and heavily in the state of Michigan we think General Motors will soon be doing the same.
I really do believe it. You know they went before my time they went to China, they spent a lot of money building stuff. They went to Mexico. They spent a lot of money building stuff. That's not helping us much. So we think they are going to come around. As we protect our jobs, we are also protecting America's borders and we are taking on the extremist and they are really radical, radical extremist Democrats who want open borders in crime because that's what happens.
Open borders and crime. Last month alone more than 76,000 illegal immigrants arrived at our borders to be apprehended. We have to apprehend them. Do you know what a great job -- I mean seriously think of that, 76,000 people many of which are rough people. Okay, I'm being nice because they will criticize me if I'm not.
They will say how dare he say that. But we have people that have criminal records. We have a lot of people. We have a lot of problems. We apprehend them. We capture them. Do you know how tough that job is, border patrol? You know how tough? I don't think any of you guys here -- yeah, you would. That guy would like it. There are some people would like it. They love it. The great American patriots and ICE, these are great American patriots.
And we are on track for 1 million illegal aliens trying to rush our borders. It is an invasion, you know that. I say invasion. They say isn't that terrible? I don't know what these people are thinking. You know, it's your country two. What are you thinking? 300 Americans a week die from Mexican-trafficked heroin.
300. Think of it, 300 a week. Tens of thousands of Americans are killed every year by heroin, meth, cocaine, fentanyl, vast quantities of which are smuggled across our southern border. You know that. 78,000 people died and that's a number that's much, much smaller than the real number. To confront the border crisis last month I declared a national emergency on our southern border.
The radical Democrats retaliated by passing a reckless resolution to terminate vital border security operations. Can you believe this? In two weeks ago I proudly issued my first veto. And two days ago our great Republicans in the House of Representatives -- I won't get fancy with you I will just say they essentially gave us the right to build the wall and lots of money is pouring in. So we are building the wall.
We will be finishing the wall. It's moving along rapidly. We are giving out many additional contracts. We are going to be building it in many different locations simultaneously with different contractors. And sometime over the next two weeks I will be going to a certain place which I won't tell you now because they will be waiting for me. I will be going to a certain place and we are going to be showing you mast sections of brand-new beautiful walls.
Because we are going to put the job to safety and to security of American citizens first. And you know when I campaigned it's going to be so much easier the second time. Remember this, I never did this before and I am one and one, right? We are 1 for 1. 1 for 1. [Inaudible] and it was tough. It was tough.
You know why? Because I get up on a stage and I've never debated before but I never left center stage. Right? Never left center stage meaning we were winning the whole time and I debated and I said where are these people coming from but I never did it and I never said to anybody I'm going to produce jobs.
I'm going to bring back your auto business. I'm going to do great for the vets. I'm going to do great for tax cuts. I'm going to cut regulations more than anybody in the history of our country in two years. I never said -- I couldn't say that. But I did say that I was going to do it but who the hell's going to believe me? Now I've done more than I ever promised I was going to do so the debate should be very easy.
Democrats want to pretend there is no border crisis. [Audience chants four more years] Thank you. Well, I'll give you a question, okay. So I told you before the lowest unemployment rates in the history of our country for African-American great citizens. Now I say that and it's like I say that and I just say your turn, what the hell are they going to do to beat that?
And we have many other things for every single citizen, everybody is benefiting. Everybody. Everybody is benefiting. So before -- so before first election, my first election. What the hell? I never did it before. I did a good job though do you think? So did you. So did you. You know the fact is we did it together and I've always said it. I didn't do it. We did it together.
But -- but think about it now instead of saying I'm going to do this I'm going to produce 5.5 million new jobs, I'm going to bring back manufacturing 600,000 new jobs in a short period of time. Now I've done it. I mean it should be easy don't you agree? It should be easy. Democrats want to pretend there is no border crisis for one simple reason because they have cause the border crisis and you know why else?
Honestly because they want boats and because they don't want to give us a win. They don't want to give us a win. They put that ahead of what's good for our country. The mass illegal immigration across our border is a direct consequence of Democrats supported loopholes, Democrat promises of amnesty, amnesty.
You have people coming up here you know they are all met by the lawyers, the lawyers and they come out, they are all met by the loiterers and they say the following phrase I am very afraid for my life. I am afraid for my life. Okay. And then I look at the guy, he looks like he just got out of the ring, he's a heavyweight champion of the world, he's [Inaudible]. It's a big fat con job, folks.
It's a big fat con job. And Democrat sanctuary cities and their refusal to protect American borders it's not the money. When I fought for them recently, they gave me so much money for everything else but nothing for the wall. Now think of it. Walls work, folks. We need the wall. They said would you call it slats?
I said I'll call it slats. Would you call it steel barriers? I said I'll -- I said I'll call it whatever the hell you want just give me the money to build it and then they sort of got a little cold feet and now I call it the wall and I got the money anyway. So that's over. But there open border policies are truly a betrayal to the American people.
This is dangerous what's coming into our country is dangerous. To defend the United States of America I deployed the United States military. I got thousands of troops. Right now we have about 4000 troops on our southern border and they are fantastic. And think of it, or years we defended the borders of foreign countries but we don't want to defend our own borders.
Think of how crazy this is. We are defending borders of countries that are 6000 miles away that many of you have never even heard the name of these countries but our southern border, our border along Mexico where we have a lot of problems in drugs and human traffickers and child traffickers and all of this coming in, we don't want to defend our border.
Think of that, how crazy that is. So now we are defending our borders for our country and the people of our country. In the last two years alone ICE officers -- we love ICE, have made listen to this though, 266,000 our risk of criminal aliens. Who the hell wants to do that? You don't want to do it, right?
You like what you are doing making cars, right? I like making cars I think better, too. But they like it. That's what they do. They are great at it including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,006 crimes, 4000 kidnappings and 4000 murders. Okay. We got them. They got them. How about if you don't get them?
How about if you leave all of those people? You know what that means for us don't you? The Democrats want to abolish ICE. They want to get rid of these very great patriots, these very tough people that love our country as much as anybody I've ever seen. They want to set violent offenders free and directly they will be coming in to your communities.
We are not going to have it. We are not having it. We want our country to be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not for criminal aliens. Right? The Republican Party will always stand with the heroes of ICE and the heroes of Border Patrol. These are great people. Every day of my Presidency ICE is tracking down gang members, drug dealers and criminal aliens and we are either throwing them behind bars or throwing them the hell out of our country.
And we are throwing out gangs like MS 13. These are some of the sickest, most demented, most vicious people in the world. We are throwing them out of our country by the thousands. In recent months the Democrat party has also been aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion of allowing children -- to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth.
And now we go a step further in Virginia. The Governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby, wrap the baby up, make the baby comfortable, to be executed after birth. That is why in my State of the Union address I called on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting the extreme late-term abortion of babies.
The Democrat Party has never been further outside of the mainstream. They are being brought so far left you wouldn't like it folks. You wouldn't like it. You won't be happy. Radical Democrats are the party of high taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, crime, hoaxes and delusions. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans.
It's what we want to be. It's the way we want to live. We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream. And every day we make good on the motto promises made, promises kept. Last week I signed in order to defend free speech on college campuses. And to keep America safe we are rebuilding America's military might making it more powerful than ever before by far.
I withdrew the United States from the horrible costly one-sided Iran nuclear deal and look what happened. Iran is a different country today than it was two and a half years ago. I recognized Israel's capital and open the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And just days ago I announced that the United States will recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
Very important. Very important. We also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela and we strongly condemn the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime. We stand with the people of Venezuela and Cuba and Nicaragua and their righteous struggled to finally be free. We stand with them. Doing a lot of work.
Socialism is not a good thing, you are right. Each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values. We believe in the American Constitution and the American rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way.
We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, to honor our history, to be proud, to be happy, to love and always to respect our great American flag. [Audience chants USA] And we believe in the words and always will, we are not changing it, they want us to change a lot of things it's not happening of our national motto in God we trust.
In God we trust. These are traditions, customs and principles that bind us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. These are the values that unite people all across the magnificent lands of Michigan. These are the values that brought the incredible people of this incredible state to Grand Rapids for the very last rally of the 2016 campaign, probably the most exciting and hopefully the most fruitful campaign in the history of our country.
On that historic day you rejected the failed political establishment that chipped away your jobs, sold out your sovereignty and tied us down in endless foreign wars which we are now winning and getting out. You stood up to the corrupt special interest and you stood up to the rigged Washington power structure.
You have stood with me. You watched this rigged power structure. You were with me. I won't forget it and you will be very proud looking back that you did it. Thank you. You took back your country. You recaptured your destiny. You defended your dignity and you proudly reclaimed your freedom, maybe for a second time.
You have always been loyal to your nation and now you have a President who is loyal to you 100 percent. The Democrats took the people of Michigan for granted but with us you will never ever be forgotten again. You will never be taken for granted ever, ever, ever. I am fighting for you and your jobs in your life in your community with everything that I have and I will never ever stop and we are winning so big.
Nobody ever thought it could happen. We will always fight on to victory. Together we are going to make our beautiful stand. We are going to stand for justice, for safety, for sovereignty and for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people and one United States of America.Because together with the very proud and very truly incredible and inspiring people of Michigan we will make America wealthy again. And we are doing it. We will make America stronger again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Michigan.
Well, thank you, Montana. What a place. What a place. And it's great to be here tonight with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots. Thank you.
And outside, you probably know what's going on. There are thousands and thousands of people. And we've decided from now on, we're going to put up screens and loud speakers so people can stay around. Because this happens all the time.
I said to my people why didn't you get a larger arena. We can't, right? We can't. But those are great people outside and I apologize. But there are thousands of them and -- yes. We really -- really love them. But you people know real estate better. You know real estate better. So it's pretty good stuff. And you're inside and I'm inside and we love each other and it's going to stay that way.
So we are thrilled to be joined by some great people. You just heard Steve Daines. He has been so helpful. He has been so helpful in Washington on the tax cuts and everything else. And I want to thank Steve and his family. They have been incredible for me in Washington. Thank you, Steve. I appreciate it.
And Steve and I are running again. You know, 2020 he comes up, so we're running together, Steve. And I want to thank Greg Gianforte. He's a member of Congress who has been 100 percent with us. Incredible success story. A lot of people don't know that but Greg is an incredible success and did a really good job and then he said he wants to give back.
And Greg, you have been fantastic. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Montana Attorney General Tim Fox. Thank you, Tim. Secretary of State, Corey Stapleton. Thank you, Corey. Montana Republican Party Chairwoman Deborah Lamb. Superintendent of Public Instructions Elsie Arntzen.
And finally, the person that we are here for tonight. A very special person, ran a incredible primary, wouldn't you say? Incredible? Anytime you win, it's incredible. But he did against some very tough and good competition. And hey, he's going to be your next senator from the incredible state of Montana. Matt Rosendale. Come up, Matt. Come up, Matt.
Hello, Montana. Do we have an incredible president or what? We actually have a president who fights every single day for the people across this great nation.
And here at home, he's fighting for military men and women serving right here in Malmstrom Air Force Base and across the country. And for all our veterans and for our seniors, he's fighting for our folks working in the timber industry, and our energy production. He's fighting for our hardworking farmers and ranchers across the entire state.
And you know he's fighting for our miners down in Butte and those coal workers in Colstrip who produce that beautiful clean coal. He's also fighting for everyone across our state who feels their voice isn't being heard, including the unborn.
And I will be that voice for you if you elect me to the United States Senate. And I will fight for you every day because I mean business about standing with President Trump to make America great again.
Because what's good for America is great for Montana. Today, I ask for your vote so that I can help President Trump continue his good work. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you, Montana. May God bless each and every one of you and the great United States of America.
Thank you very much. That was great. This is a really good man. This is a man that loves the people of Montana, loves the people of this country.
It's time to retire liberal Democrat Jon Tester. And you're going to get on your side a real Montana fighter. You see it. You've been watching for the last six months, he is a tough cookie. He's a fighter. He's going to fight for you, Matt Rosendale.
So Jon Tester says one thing when he's in Montana. But I will tell you, I'm testament to it, he does the exact opposite when he goes to Washington. A vote for Jon Tester is a vote for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and the new leader of the Democrat Party Maxine Waters. Where have they gone?
Jon Tester voted no on repealing Obamacare. And even though we got a little surprise vote that evening, you all remember that evening somebody came in with a thumbs down after campaigning for years that he was going to repeal and replace. But that's OK because we, for the most part, have already done it.
And we have great health care coming out and it just came out two weeks ago. And we got rid of the individual mandate and lots of other things. Sometimes we have to do it the hard way, but that's OK, too.
Jon Tester voted no on tax cuts for Montana families. He voted no on cutting the estate tax or the death tax for your farms, your farmers, and your small businesses. Think of that one. Think of that one. But you got it anyway because we got it passed.
So, on your farms, for the most part, you will have no estate tax or death tax to pay. You can leave your farm, you can leave your small business to your children or whoever you want to leave them, don't always leave them to the children. If the children aren't good children don't, leave them to somebody else.
But you have no tax to pay, pretty good, right? Nobody thought that was going to happen. Tester voted against it. Jon Tester voted no on legislation to stop late term abortions. You wouldn't think it'd play very well out here. How did he get elected?
I mean, I know -- I know a lot of people from Montana. You've got to explain that one to me. How did he get elected? All right. You can right your wrong in November, OK? You can right your wrong. Matt Rosendale.
Jon Tester voted no on Kate's Law. You know what Kate's Law is. That's legislation named for Kate Steinle who was gunned down by a five-time deported illegal immigrant. You deserve a senator who doesn't just talk like he's from Montana. You deserve a senator who actually votes like he's from Montana.
Tester even voted no on enhanced vetting for refugees from terror-stricken countries. You believe this one? What's going on with that? The Democrats want open borders, which means lots of crime.
We want tough, strong, powerful borders, and we want no crime and we're going to protect ICE. We protect ICE. They protect us and we protect them.
They protect us and we protect them. You saw that clown yesterday on the Statue of Liberty? You see the guys that went up there? I wouldn't have done it. I would have said let's get some nets and let's wait until she comes down. Just get some nets. Really? Yes.
You see those guys -- the bravery of doing that? What a group. We protect ICE, and our border patrol, and our law enforcement, and our fire department.
And our fire department. We protect our people. Jon Tester opposed our travel ban to keep America safe, which, by the way, I'm proud to report that last week the Supreme Court of the United States just upheld the Trump travel ban.
And they gave us the authority to protect our nation, keep our nation safe -- to keep it safe. As you know, there's now a vacancy on the Supreme Court. And if you turn in Monday at 9 o'clock, I think you're going to be extremely with the selection, right?
And they're all great. They're all great. And I want to thank Justice Kennedy for his lifetime of truly distinguished service. And he had confidence in me. He left because he said you're going to pick somebody great, and so nice. So nice. Great man, great --a great gentleman.
Jon Tester voted against Neil Gorsuch, the incredible justice who supports fully our Constitution. That's a hard one to vote against, isn't it? Tester opposed many of our amazing judges. And yet, I see Jon Tester saying such nice things about me. I say, yes, but he never votes for me. He never votes. And it's all -- I'd rather have him say bad about me but vote, right?
Yes, Jon Tester voted for liberal Obama judges who tried to take away your Second Amendment, tried to take it away because Tester doesn't share your values. Jon Tester showed his true colors with his shameful dishonest attacks on a great man, a friend of mine. A man that I said, why don't you run the V.A.? You'd be great. Navy Admiral Ronny Jackson.
And a report just came out, and I should have brought it because I would have read it, but it's long but beautiful for Ronny Jackson. Secret Service are all over the place. And they wrote a report that what he said was so false and so untrue. Never happened. And they could have ruined -- they could have ruined -- could have ruined a lesser man.
But Dr. Jackson -- I don't know do I -- should I call him "admiral" or "doctor" -- I'll call him both. Doctor slash Admiral. He's a doctor, he's an Admiral, his son is a top -- really a top, like a top, top student at Annapolis graduating this year. An incredible wife, incredible family.
You know I feel guilty. I feel guilty. Admiral Jackson was getting ready to leave service and he served many years admirably. Not a blemish. Perfect. Beautiful person. A lot of you know exactly. He actually said I was healthy. You know he's the one.
When the fake news started and said why isn't Trump giving the physical? Why? Dr. Jackson and his staff, they went out, they gave me a physical. That was a physical. [Laughter] And when they said I'm very healthy, the news was devastated.
They were devastated. They didn't want to hear that. They didn't want to hear that. But he's a great family man and -- and I said to him, I feel guilty. I said, hey, doc, why don't you run the V.A.? You're a leader, you're an Admiral, people admire you.
He's an admired guy or I wouldn't have done it. Well, sir, I wasn't really thinking of that. I say, doc, you'll be great. Go ahead and do it. Sir, whatever your order, I will do. You know he's like, even if he didn't want to do it, he said that to me.
In fact, you're great First Lady said to me that same day, well, did he want to do it? I said I really don't know, he said he'd do it. But then when I thought about it, I don't know. But he said, if you ask, I will do it. But he didn't really want to do it. So I sort of feel guilty about this whole thing because what happened is he said, sir, if you would like me to do it I'll do it. Wasn't what he had in mind. I put him into the world of politics. How vicious is the world?
But Jon Tester said things about him that were horrible and that weren't true. [Booing] And that's probably why I'm here because I won Montana by so many points I don't have to come here..
You know a lot of people from states where we have these crazy big leads, we had 42 and 44 -- we won by 44 points over a Democrat. Over a Democrat. We won -- won by 44 points over a Democrat. Now it was Crooked Hillary, but still she's a Democrat. [Laughter]
And -- yes. No, she gets special treatment. Sorry. Sorry. She gets special treatment under the Justice Department. [Crowd chants Lock Her Up] Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. She gets special treatment under the Justice Department. [Booing]
Anybody else in America -- how about that FBI agent? How about that guy? You think he likes me? You think he likes me? You think there was just a little bias there -- a little bias? Oh, did we catch them in the act. It's a rigged deal folks. It's a rigged deal. I used to say it. It's a rigged deal. It's a disgrace.
And we go away on Monday. We appoint and go away, and I'll see lots of people. I'll see NATO and I'm going to tell NATO -- you got to start paying your bills. The United States is not going to take care of everything. We're paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent to protect Europe, and that's fine.
Of course they kill us on trade. They kill us on other things. They make it impossible to do business in Europe, and yet they come in and they sell their Mercedes and their BMWs to us. So we have $151 billion in trade deficits with the E.U. And on top of that, they kill us with NATO. They kill us. So we pay 4 percent of a huge GDP, which got a lot bigger since I became your president.
And Germany -- Germany which is the biggest country of the E.U., European Union, Germany pays 1 percent One percent. And I said, you know, Angela, I can't guarantee it, but we're protecting you, and it means a lot more to you than protecting us because I don't know how much protection we get by protecting you.
And then they go out and make a gas deal, oil and gas, from Russia, where they pay billions and billions of dollars to Russia. OK, so they want to protect against Russia, and yet they pay billions of dollars to Russia, and we are the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing. [Booing]
So then -- and by the way, I have to say this. Since I came, which is a year and a half, almost $33 billion more is projected to be paid by those NATO nations, but it's not enough. Do they ever tell you that? No, no. But I will tell you, the Secretary General Stoltenberg is Trump's biggest fan. He says, those NATO nations are going like this, less money, less money. Why not? And when you started talking, it went like a rocket ship. Went just like a rocket ship.
So anytime I suggest anything -- so we've got $33 billion -- it's going to be a lot more money than that. But then they say, let's see, he's angry at NATO. I guess, yeah, he loves Russia. I love Russia. I will say this, I am meeting with President Putin next week and getting along -- let me tell you, getting along with Russia and getting along with China and getting along with other countries is a good thing. It's not a bad thing. It's a good thing.
I would say for stupid people or for political people, because they're not stupid, all they are good at obstruction, good at resisting. You know, their whole thing there thing is resist, but every time it comes up -- I will say this, I'm going to have to ask them this question. How bad has it been since Trump has been in? Take a look at what's happened. Take a look we've just increased our military spending. We are at $700 billion. We've become a nation that is exporting energy for the first time. We're exporting energy.
So many things. And you look at the money that NATO is getting now. They're probably saying in Russia, you know, if we did like this guy, we've made a big mistake. We'd rather have crooked Hillary Clinton. I think they would much rather have Hillary. But getting along with other countries -- and you're talking nuclear powers, in all fairness.
Getting along is really a nice thing. It's a smart thing. We're going to beat everybody, we have the greatest military. We have now -- look we have now -- and hopefully, we'll never have to use it. The only way you're never going to have to use it? If it's so powerful, so good, so strong that nobody wants to play games, and that's what we are doing. We'll never have to use it.
And then of course, we have North Korea, where you noticed eight months -- so during the Obama administration, it seemed like a missile a week. I mean a lot of missiles going up, a lot of rockets going up, a lot of nuclear testing. They thought there was an earthquake the size of something they had never tested before.
They said, where is it? Oh it's in Korea someplace. They said, why don't you check nuclear weapons. It was a nuclear weapon. So since the rhetoric stopped --we had very tough rhetoric. Wouldn't you say it was a little tough, right? So remember, they said, he's too tough. He's going to cause a war. It's too tough. Now they say he's too nice. Hes too nice. I got along very well with Chairman Kim. I got along well -- that's a good that I got along well. Now what hasn't happened in eight months? In eight months -- first of all, we got our prisoners back before I even went, right?
And I didn't pay $1.8 billion by the way, in cash. We didn't pay $1.8 billion, right? We paid slightly less than 1.8. We paid nothing.
And yet -- and yet it was a very smart deal for North Korea. Goodwill is very important. But we signed a wonderful paper saying they're going to denuclearize their whole thing. It's going to all happen.
But now, you know, you're back -- I was back I think six days, "Why hasn't is started? Why?" I mean, these guys, like -- Obama was very close to going to war. You have 30 million people in Seoul. It's 30 miles off the border. And that's a tough border. Thousands of -- of cannons, they call them. These are big, big guns. I'm not even talking about nuclear. You could have lost 30, 40, 50 million people. You could have had a war like you haven't had in a long time.
And guess what you have now? Eight months, no nuclear testing, no missiles, no anything. Mike Pompeo is over there right now. And they -- they --they say, "He" -- meaning me, these guys, the crooked press, they are so dishonest. [Booing] They are so dishonest. [Booing] Fake news. They're fake news media.
So what do they say all the time? Because I didn't give anything up. What do they say all the time? They say, "He went there." I went there. I went to Singapore. We had a meeting. "By agreeing to meet" -- you know, they can't come up with anything else, like -- I didn't give, like Clinton and like Obama would have -- you know, Obama couldn't meet. Now they say, "Well Obama" -- Obama couldn't meet. They wouldn't see him. So I didn't have -- like Clinton, where they gave him billions and billions of dollars and got nothing. OK?
So they couldn't find anything, so what did they do? They say, "He met." I met. That's what we lost, folks. He met. Now by the way, Obama would have loved to have met. They wouldn't see him. They wouldn't see him. One of the first question I asked when I was over there, they wouldn't see him.
So I met. That's how we got beaten. That -- now they're saying it with Putin. "Well, Putin is highly prepared, and Trump, will he be prepared for the meeting?" Trust me, we'll do just fine. We'll do good. Fake news. Bad people.
Will he be prepared? Will he be prepared? And I might even end up having a good relationship, but they're going, "Will President Trump be prepared? You know, President Putin is KGB and this and that." You know what? Putin's fine. He's fine. We're all fine. We're people. Will I be prepared? Totally prepared. I've been preparing for this stuff my whole life. They don't say that. They don't say that.
And you really do, you really -- and I tell you what. Because I see it. I see the way they write. They're so damn dishonest. And I don't mean all of them, because some of the finest people I know are journalists. Really. Hard to believe when I say that. I hate to say it, but I have to say. But 75 percent of those people are downright dishonest. Downright dishonest.
They're fake. They're fake. They quote sources -- "A source within the Trump organization said" -- a source. They don't have a source. They never use names anymore. You know, in the old days, you have to use names. "Jim Smith said that Donald Trump is a bad guy." They don't do that anymore. They say, "A source within the administration." They make the sources up. They don't exist in many cases.
Any time you say -- you know, I saw one of them said "15 anonymous sources" -- I don't have 15 people in the White -- I mean, forget it. [Laughter]
Fifteen anonymous sources have said all sorts of stuff. These are really bad people. But here's the bottom line: we're here. How the hell did we get here? Really? How did [Inaudible]...
How did we get here? So if you look at Jon Tester, he signed up for the Democrats' radical immigration agenda, which is "let them come in, and we believe they say, in sanctuary cities where they house the criminals and others" -- we believe in strong borders and no crime, it's very simple. Strong border. We believe in coming into this country legally. We believe in coming in legally.
We believe in the merit system. So when you have a business and somebody comes in and honestly -- hate to tell you this, got to go with it -- we are doing so well. So many businesses are moving back to this country. So many car companies are coming back into Michigan and to Ohio and to Pennsylvania and to North and South Carolina.
We need people. We don't have the workers anymore. And by the way, that's something that's unique. You haven't heard that for a long time. Wages are going up. Right? But we need people. But who do we need? We need people that come in under the merit system. Under the merit system. A vote for the Democrats in November is a vote to let MS-13 run wild in our communities. [Booing]
To let drugs pour into our cities, and to take jobs and benefits away from our hardworking Americans, and we're not letting it happen. Democrats want anarchy, they really do, and they don't know who they're playing with, folks.
I said it the other day, yes, she is a low IQ individual, Maxine Waters. I said it the other day. High -- I mean, honestly, she's somewhere in the mid-60s, I believe that.
He will be impeached. I will impeach him. Even the Democrats are saying, "How are you saying that?" They don't want to use that word, because it gets the Republicans out to vote. They say, "Stay away from that word. Especially since he's done nothing wrong." That helps also, right?
There's no collusion. No collusion. After spending $22 million, it's awfully tough. And the House just left and they said, "There's no collusion." Can you imagine this? It's all a ruse. This was an excuse for the Democrats who lost an election, who actually got their ass kicked, 306...
306 to 223, that's a pretty good shellackit; 306 -- hey, we won states -- take Wisconsin, I just left Wisconsin. So we won -- in fact, we're building -- they're building -- friends of mine -- Foxconn, they make the Apple laptops and iPhones are incredible. They're -- we're going to spend -- they are going to spend, like, $11 billion, and this is going to be about a $15 billion plant.
There will be nothing like it in this country, and frankly, outside of China, there will be nothing like it, but by the time it's finished, it'll top anything in China also. It's incredible.
It's incredible. But -- but $15 billion, 15,000 jobs to Wisconsin. But think of Wisconsin. Reagan had his big win. He won every state except for one, the great state of Wisconsin. I won Wisconsin. First time -- first time since Dwight Eisenhower in 1952.
And we won Michigan. And we won Pennsylvania, North Carolina and South Carolina and Florida, we ran up that East Coast. You had a run up that East Coast -- winning the Electoral College is very tough for a Republican, much tougher than the so-called "popular vote," where people vote four times, you know. Much tougher. Much, much tougher.
We had a great -- we had a great victory. But think of it. Not since Dwight Eisenhower, 1952. What an -- was that one of the great evenings? Was that one of the...
And I always say, because the ratings that they're getting are beyond belief. You know, the New York Times was ready to fold. It was going to close. And then I came along, unfortunately, and they -- they sell. But don't worry. Because ultimately, when I leave in 7 years from now... Of course... They'll fold. They will fold.
No, no, when you see the Times, how dishonest they are, when you see the Washington Post, how totally dishonest -- when we leave -- and I actually say this: they are all doing numbers that they've, like, never done. When I announce, they are going to endorse me. Because if I lose -- should I lose -- or if I don't run, they're out of business. Who's going to cover?
They're going to cover Bernie? Hey, they're going to cover like sleepy Joe Biden? They're going to cover Pocahontas who was? Think of it. Think of it, she of the great tribal heritage.
What tribe is it? Let me think about that one. Meantime, she's based her life on being a minority. Pocahontas -- they always want me to apologize for saying that and I hereby -- oh no, I want to apologize. I'll use tonight. Pocahontas, I apologize to you. I apologize -- to you I apologize.
To the fake Pocahontas, I won't apologize. No, it's causing problems. You know that's name causing -- because now even the liberals are saying take a test. Take a test. You know, the -- I tell you, I shouldn't tell you because I like not to give away secrets but this one. Let's say I'm debating Pocahontas, right?
I promise you I'll do this. I will take -- you know those little kits they sell on television for $2. Learn your heritage. The guy says I was born in Scotland, it turns out he was born in Puerto Rico. And that's OK. It's good, you know. Guy says I was born in Germany, well, he wasn't born in Germany. He was born someplace else.
I'm going to get one of those little kits and in the middle of the debate when she proclaims that she's of Indian heritage because her mother says she has high cheekbones. That's her only evidence, that her mother said she had high cheekbones. We will take that little kit and say, but we have to do it gently.
Because we're in the me-too generation so I have to be very gentle. And we will very gently take that kit and we will slowly toss it, hoping it doesn't hit her and injure her arm even though it only weighs probably two ounces. And we will say, I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity, paid for by Trump, if you take the test so that it shows you're an Indian. You know.
And let's see what she does. I have a feeling she will say no but we will that for the debates. Do me a favor, keep it within this room. Because I don't want to give away any secrets and the press is very honorable, they won't. Please don't tell her what I just said. Democrats are launching outrageous attacks against our incredible law enforcement and our ICE and border patrol.
The new platform of the Democrat party, and by the way, I call it the Democrat party. It sounds better rhetorically, you know. I wrote best sellers, I guess I speak well. You know, we turned away thousands of people. They never say I'm a great speaker. Why the hell do so many people come? Why -- I don't think -- it's true, why do they come? Why?
Why, oh why, do they come? It's got to be something. I guess they like my policy -- maybe my policy. No, it's true. Have you ever noticed, you never hear that -- you never hear that. You never hear it. I mean, there's got to be a reason. I have broken more Elton John records, he seems to have a lot of records and we beat -- and I, by the way, I don't have a musical instrument.
I don't have a guitar or an organ. No organ. Elton has an organ and lots of other people help him. You know we've broken a lot of records. We've broken virtually every record because you know, look, I only need this space. They need much more room for basketball, for hockey, for all the sports. They need a lot of room.
We don't need it. We have people in that space, so we break all these records. But really we do it without like the musical instruments. This is the only musical, the mouth, and hopefully the brain attached to the mouth, right? The brain, more important than the mouth is the brain. The brain is much more important.
But they -- do you ever notice -- do you ever hear something, they say -- you know we had a case last week we were in a great place in Wisconsin. And we had a tremendous crowd and we have like the choice of a 22,000 seat arena and in retrospect, we would have packed it and they would have sent away thousands of people.
But the people said to me, very innocent people, they were great. But I hadn't met them. I said why didn't you -- they -- they filled up a 7,000 seat arena, walked away thousands of people, like over 20. and we would have filled -- and I said why didn't you use the bigger arena?
He said, sir, we knew that if you had five vacant seats, empty seats -- see vacant just because I was in the [Inaudible], I'll say use that term. If you had five empty seats, they would say Donald Trump was unable to fill the arena. And I said, you know what, you're right.
How about the one from the Washington Post? They got there four hours early and the arena hadn't started even letting people in. So there was just a few people, you all saw that story, I hope. You all saw that story, right? They got there four hours, five hours -- this writer, sleazebag -- he didn't get fired.
He said Donald Trump had an empty arena, except when I showed up, the place was packed and they had to walk away thousands of people. Right?
And I didn't see this story but you know who saw the story? The people that were in the arena and they went nuts. And they apologized but you know where they apologized? On Twitter. They didn't write -- they apologized but they had the story Donald Trump, not very good crowd tonight.
And they show a totally empty arena that four hours later -- and by the way, hate to say it, take a look at the pictures for the inauguration. We had some monster crowd. Big, monster -- big monster -- but take a look at that. So they show an arena before the people started coming in.
There were a few people, four or five hours ahead, and they apologized because it's a disgrace. But let me just tell you, the Democrats -- we call them the Democrat party. You know why? The Democratic party sounds too good. Sounds better, doesn't it? I always hate saying the Democrat party. A lot of people say you meant to say well actually their name is the Democrat party.
The Democratic party sounds too good so I don't want to use it. OK? The new platform of the Democrat party is to abolish ICE. In other words, they want to abolish immigration enforcement entirely. That's what they want to do. They want -- they want everybody coming in.
And you know the beauty with ICE -- they're so tough. When you have these MS-13 thugs come in, ICE goes in and wipes them out like nothing because they're much tougher. They wipe them out and they liberate towns and on islands and other places. You know its like -- it's like you're occupied.
It's like a nation is occupying your country. So we're taking them out by the thousands. And if it weren't for ICE, we wouldn't be doing it. These are savage gangs, MS-13 and others. We will not stand for these vile Democrat smears against our law enforcement and that includes our great police. That includes our great border patrol. That includes our military where they're always fighting against funding for the military.
We will always stand by, proudly, the heroes -- and they're our heroes on ICE and border patrol and law enforcement and on military. Every day I'm president, we will track down the gang members, drug deals, child predators and criminal aliens that we find. We will get them. We will throw the hell out of our country or put them in jail.
So this year -- in November if you want to save ICE and frankly, if you want to save your law enforcement, if you want to save your military, getting military funding -- we've got $700 billion, the biggest ever, then next year $760. We saved our military getting military funding from these Democrats is almost impossible.
They don't want it, they don't care about military, they don't care about our law enforcement. They couldn't give a damn. You better vote Republican. We need more Republicans.
If you want to protect your family and your community, then you have no choice. You have to vote [Inaudible], you have to vote for Republicans. If you want to have a country, if you want borders -- how about borders? Would it be nice to have borders? [Crowd Chants Build that Wall']
And, yes, we are already building the wall. It started in California, in San Diego. $1.6 billion, we're asking for $5 billion. And I'll tell you what, it's -- it's brutal with these people.
They don't want it. They -- they know it's the right thing to do but they think it will help me. It's not even the Republicans -- they think it'll help Trump. If we do it, it's good for Trump. Let's not do it. They're great Americans.
Every day, we are keeping our promises. We've created 3.4 million jobs since Election Day, which nobody can even believe.
Nobody believes it. I always say if I would have said that on the campaign trail when I was here or anyplace else it would have been brutal. They would have said, how can you possibly say a thing like that, 3.4 million new jobs? Unemployment claims are at a 45-year low.
African-American and Hispanic-American unemployment have reached the lowest levels in the history of our country. Remember, what do you have to lose? Remember, what do you have to lose?
People didn't like it when I said that. What do you have to lose? Guess, what, we're right. In fact, a new poll came out last week, we were up -- in like a week -- 10 points with the Hispanic community. Ten points.
Because they want to be safe. Unemployment among women is at the lowest level it's been in 65 years in, within a couple of weeks, history. Our economic policy can be summed up in three very simple but beautiful but beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.
Since the election, we have lifted 3 million people off of food stamps. And, by the way, on a humanitarian basis that's a great thing. Do you how much money we save by doing that as a country? Three million people and it's going up fast.
Wages, for the first time in 18 years are rising again. People can go out, they can actually choose a job and they have wages that are rising. And six months ago, Republicans passed the biggest tax cuts in American history, the biggest in American history. Everyone in this room is benefiting.
Everybody is benefiting. We slashed taxes for working families and saved our family farms. We saved family farms. As a result of our tax cuts, $300 billion poured back into the United States just in the first quarter of this year alone.
And we're going to have a lot more than that. $300 billion came back, money that would have never been able to come back into our country. It's coming back, it's pouring back. I think the number's going to be $5 trillion, but $350 billion has already come back.
Apple computer is spending $350 billion on new campuses, on new facilities. They're bringing back $350 billion. They're going to actually have -- probably, subject to the tax code, about $230 billion come back. Ninety-five percent of U.S. manufacturers are optimistic about the future. That's the highest number ever. Think of it, 95 percent of anything, you don't hear that.
We also repealed, despite the thumb down at 2 o'clock in the morning, we also repealed the most horrible aspect of the failed Obamacare health care, it's called the individual mandate. So, it's gone. It's gone. Gone.
It's gone. And, you know, that was where you had to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health care. OK? One of the truly rip-offs, that was a big rip-off but we got rid of it.
So all you people, how many people were you paying for not to have it? Lot of people, right? Yes, a lot of people. A lot people, they paid not to have health care. That doesn't work.
We are allowing businesses to join forces to buy better health care for less money through association health plans. They just came out two weeks ago and they cross state lines. We're allowed to cross state lines, you're going to get very low prices for very good [Inaudible] ...
Millions of people are already signing up. And after decades of waiting, we opened ANWR in Alaska for energy development. They've been trying to get that approved for 40 years.
We've eliminated record numbers of job killing regulations. We've stopped cold the assault on our farmers, our ranchers, hunters, energy producers, and our great and loving miners. We love our miners.
And we put our miners back to work, clean coal. We are proudly and strongly protecting our public lands for future generations. You see that. You see it all over. You see what we're doing. You see legislation. You see what's happening.
We approved the Keystone and the Dakota Access pipelines right away, 48,000 jobs -- 48,000 jobs. We withdrew from the job killing Paris Climate accord, one of the most unfair deals. I said, boy, I'm going to get killed when I approve this one. When I sign off this, you know it sounds so pretty, right?
The Paris Climate, who wouldn't do that, except it's horrible for us -- great for other countries but horrible for us. We took historic action to safeguard your constitutional freedoms, protecting religious liberty, defending the Second Amendment and confirming a record number of circuit court judges.
And we are bringing back our wealth from foreign countries. But, you know this, right? We are bringing back our wealth from foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years.
For too long we watched, and we waited and we saw as other countries stole our jobs, cheated our workers, and gutted our industry. You look at all the places -- here? Yes, even here. But you look at some places, you look at some -- you go up to New England and you still see the -- the remnants where they moved down to Mexico under NAFTA, one of the worst deals that we're negotiating.
And I have a feeling, they'll come along. We'll see. And if they don't, we'll actually do better. We'll actually do better. The United States of America was the piggybank that everybody was robbing.
And let me tell you, our allies in many cases were worse than our enemies. We opened our country to their goods but they put up massive barriers to keep our products and our goods the hell out of their country because they didn't want that competition. And that's not free trade, that's stupid trade. We're not going to do that. We don't do that anymore.
We have to have fair and reciprocal -- that being the more important word. We need reciprocal. They charge a 50 percent tax. We charge a 50 percent tax. Then we say, look, let's bring it to nothing, or I don't care one way or the other. Do whatever you want.
And then, I'll have people complaining. They'll say -- it's incredible. So we have countries ripping us off for years. And then, when I say, well, look we're going to put tariffs on there because they have been ripping us. We have trade deficits. They have surpluses. That would be unbelievable.
So, they have all of this and I say we are going to do something about it. And I'll get calls from some politicians. Oh, that's terrible. I say, no, you don't understand. We're going to make great deals. No, no let's just leave it the way it is. Please, just leave it the way it is. Leave it the way it is.
I say, no, no. We have all the cards. We're the bank that everybody's stealing from. You saw with China, $50 billion and another $200 billion frankly is waiting. Nobody's ever seen this before because China, and I have great respect for President Xi and for China. You have to respect them. You have to admire them.
Now, they'll say, Donald Trump loves China -- loves China more than he loves the United States. These people but -- so you have to be careful what you say.
Because if I say that I do, I respect China, and I respect President Xi, but they've been killing us -- $507 billion dollars in trade deficits last year -- 507. Who the hell can lose 500 -- then you want to do something about it and you get attacked. Oh, that's not nice. That's not free trade. The war was lost on trade many years ago.
You know when they were saying not a free trader. I said no, no. The war was lost but now we're going to win it and because we have all the cards.
But it's always helpful when you don't have the little ones sniping at your heels, because it's easier to negotiate when you have support. You don't have some senator that was forced out of office because he didn't like me saying bad things like, oh, we shouldn't be doing that against China; we shouldn't be doing that against so and so. We are in such a great position. Other countries are calling us.
Do you know that if we knocked down the trade deficit, right, the trade deficit by just a little bit, 25 percent -- we can do that easily. That's easy. If we do that, we pick up one point in GDP. Does anybody know that?
That's three trillion dollars and that's 10 million jobs. That's just 25 percent. We pick up one point. And speaking of GDP, remember when I'd say it's going to go to 3 percent pretty quickly and all of this? Well now, The Atlanta Fed just predicted 4.8 percent.
Now, who knows. Who knows. Who knows. Who knows. I can only tell you that it's going to be a lot better than what you had with Obama. And if these people got elected, you would have gone down like you'd never seen anything go down. They wouldn't have taken the regulations off. They wouldn't have given you the tax cuts, the Democrats. You would have had an economy that was going to crash and burn. It was ready. And now we've got something that's a rocket ship.
And every time I meet a leader of another country, which is often, they always start by saying, sir, I'd like to congratulate you on the incredible job you've done with the United States economy.
Japan. South Korea. Every time they say, I'd like to congratulate you. And others are -- they are actually studying what we've done. They're studying what we've done. But we have the greatest people in the world and we're doing good. You know, that -- those hats, those beautiful, beautiful hats, "Make America Great Again."
Soon to be changed to, "Keep America Great." [Inaudible]. "Keep America Great." Soon to be changed. I can't use "Make America Great Again" for the second run, right? [Inaudible]. They said, why the hell did you do it the first time? Right?
It's called "Keep America Great," because what we're doing is incredible. It's incredible. We've created -- think of this, since the election, we've created in wealth, seven trillion dollars. Seven trillion. Seven trillion.
We're the fastest growing nation on an economy basis -- maybe it's for the big nations but I heard "nation" -- we're the fastest growing economically nation in the world. Think of that.
I add the big nation because they're probably back -- I don't know, maybe it said big -- whatever it is, we're doing really well.
But we're one of the fastest, and I think we're actually the fastest growing. And we are certainly growing our military and growing our power and our strength, and we're taking care of our vets more than anybody's ever taken care of our vets.
Thanks to Republican leadership, America is winning again. We're winning. Remember I tell you the story, and America's being respected again all over the world. It's been a long time. We're respected.
Somebody said, could you tell the winning story backstage. I said, they've heard it. But, Steve Daines -- great Senator -- comes up to me and I say, hi, Steve. [Inaudible] sir, the people of Montana, they're really tired, sir, of all this winning.
Too much. They can't take it anymore. They can't take it. We've got to slow it down, sir. They can't take it. I say, Steve, go back to the people. He's going more. Go back to the people and say, I'm sorry, I cannot honor that request. We are going to win and win, and we're going to win more. We are going to win like we've never won before.
Like we've never one before. Because We are finally putting America first. We're putting America first. And by the way, you know all the rhetoric you see, the Thousand Points of Light. What the hell was that by the way? Thousands Points of Light. What did that mean? Does anyone know?
I know one thing: Make America great again, we understand. Putting America first, we understand. Thousand Points of Light, I never quite got that one. What the hell is that? Has anyone ever figured that one out? And it was put by a Republican [Inaudible].
But We are indeed doing things for this country like nobody believed possible. We're rebuilding our economy. And at the same time, we are restoring our security. We have people flooding our borders like they haven't flooded ever before.
They're doing an incredible job, but we've never had a rush like this. That's because people want a piece of our action. They want to come into our economy. They want to come in. The problem is, you have to come in legally. You have to come in through the legal [Inaudible]. Sorry.
All of that money that we've secured for our military, all of that I've directed the Pentagon to begin a process of creating a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces called the Space Force. You have the Air Force, you will have the Space Force.
You know, people are so excited by that. You know, it's not just sending rockets to the moon and rockets to mars. This is also a military imperative. In fact, in Russia, they said, we consider that very threatening, and others did, too.
But I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And you know, if it's a part of the Air Force, the Air Force is going to focus on the Air Force. We need a separate branch, and we're working on that. It's called the Space Force, which is very exciting.
And people love it. People love it. They get it, and they love it. We passed a landmark V.A. accountability law that everybody said could not be passed. I won't blame the unions, and I won't blame civil service. But let's assume they had a little blame. Everyone said, it couldn't be passed, has not been able to be passed for 45 years, and we just got it passed, V.A. accountability. So now you can fire people when they don't do a job. We can fire when they don't do it.
You're fired. You get them the hell out. They're not taking care of our vets, we fire them. They are out of there [Inaudible]. They're out of there.
And the other thing that we just passed a few weeks ago, and you've heard me talk about this, I've always said, you know, our greatest people, they're the greatest people, the vets. They've protected us. Some of them have suffered greatly. And we weren't taking proper care of them. They were waiting in line for 12 days.
How about anybody in this audience, go to their doctor, say I'm sorry, can't see you for 12 days. Even if you have, like, a bad cold, you have something. People were going in with nothing much, and they were coming out six months later. They can't see a doctor. They were coming out with a terminal illness that could've been corrected easily.
And I said, why are we sending people who can wait for these long periods -- just send them across the street to a local doctor. Get taken care of, and we pay the bill. And everybody said, we've been trying to get that passed for 40 years. I got it passed three weeks ago.
I am good at getting things passed. Remember we had repeal and replace passed except for one person, and all of the Democrats I have [Inaudible] say. One person plus all of the Democrats. We got no Democrats -- including Tester. He wasn't there for us. President Trump is a great man. He's a great man. I really got a vote for us. Got a vote for us.
We also believe that American foreign aid dollars should promote America's interest and values. We don't need to send your hard-earned money to countries that vote against the United States consistently in the United Nations and other places. We don't need [Inaudible].
Remember with Israel; remember when we had two votes on something having to do with Israel. I said we're watching; with all the aide we give all these countries, we're watching. We ended up getting 68 votes. We didn't do anything. Because they're ripping us, they're taking our money, they don't even vote for us because they didn't respect our country, but now they respect them a lot more.
And in many cases, they're not getting that money anymore, too. We stopped it. Instead of apologizing for America, we are standing up for America, and we are standing up for our great American flag.
Hey, how about the NFL? Look, I don't want to cause controversy. You're right, USA is right. I don't want to cause controversy, but how about they passed this stupid thing. You don't have to do this anymore. If you don't respect the flag or if you don't like the country or whatever it is, just go into the locker room. Just go into the locker room. I think in many respects, that's worse. Isn't that worse than not standing?
You know? I think that's worse. So they say go into the locker room. So OK, the Anthem's getting ready to play, they run into the locker room, then they come back out. You know what? That doesn't play. That doesn't play. It doesn't play. [Booing]
I actually think, in many ways, it's worse. I heard this thing, I think; they were so happy the owners. This commissioner, where this guy comes from I have no -- they're paying him $40 million a year and their ratings are down 20 percent. But you know why their ratings are down?
Yes, the flag. But they're also down because people find politics. In other words, hitting Trump, incorrectly, but hitting Trump. They find that to be much tougher, meaner and more interesting than watching a football game. They actually do.
And they're watching the cable networks instead of watching football. They're down 20 percent since this whole thing started with the flag and the Anthem. Washington tried to change us, but instead we are actually changing Washington. We've had a big impact. And now we need Matt Rosendale in the Senate to continue our fight to drain the swamp. We're going to get it done.
We need to work every day from now until the election, for your family, for your community, your country, for your constitution. And this November I need you to get your friends, get your colleagues, get your neighbors and get your ass out to vote. Is that OK? Get your ass out to vote.
Vote for Matt. They're going to say, oh, That was not presidential. Watch. That was not presidential. Did I ever tell you how easy for me it would be for me to be presidential, you know. Like we're all -- me, you, we're really smart people. I have, by the way, the most loyal people in the world, they're the smartest, they're the toughest people.
They're the greatest people in the world. But they'll something like that's not presidential. And what I say, acting presidential is so easy for me, would be -- it's much easier than what I do. Much easier. And sometimes I have to do it. You walk up to the microphone, right. Good evening ladies and gentleman of the great state of Montana. [Laughter]
You have to put a little emphasis right? This is wonderful to be with you tonight. Thank you for being here. Goodbye.
Now, the people of Montana, they know. They know. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. Returning the power where it belongs, to the people. [Crowd Chants 'USA']
Our proud American ancestors crossed oceans, scaled mountains, defeated empires and built the modern world with their own two hands. They were brilliant. This state, the State of Montana was forged by incredible pioneer men and women who braved the call and tamed the wilderness to build a beautiful life, right out here in the open. And I did look at those skies, you know, I heard so much about ...
... your sky. I heard so much about your skies. I flown in and I looked at those skies. Not seeing pollution is a wonderful thing, right?
Those are beautiful skies. These Montana pioneers were tough, and they were strong, and they were brilliant. They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury, but they had faith, they heart, they had grit and they had each other. They had each other. And, above all else, they loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God.
We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who knew how to fight and they knew how to win. You talk about winning, they knew how to win.
And with your help, your voice, and your vote we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning. And the truth is, you will never ever get tired of winning, never.
We won't back down. We won't give in and we will never ever surrender. We will never ever quit. We go forward to victory. Because are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, we are one family, and we are one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again.
Soon, we will make America strong again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Montana. Thank you.
Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Thank you. Hello, Green Bay. Thank you. We love Green Bay. Thank you. Thank you. In the great state of Wisconsin, home of the legendary Green Bay Packers and there's no place I'd rather be than right here in America's heartland, right? And there's no one I'd rather be with than you, the hardworking patriots, who make our country run so well and it's running right now better, maybe than it ever has.
Thank you. The strength of our nation is found in the heart of our people, so true. Tonight, America's heart is with the victims of the horrific synagogue shooting in Poway, California just happened. Our entire nation mourns the loss of life, prays for the wounded and stands in solidarity with the Jewish community.
We forcefully condemn the evil of anti-Semitism and hate, which must be defeated. Just happened, must be defeated. And we are grateful to the law enforcement personnel for their courageous response, incredible response today by law enforcement. And I especially want to recognize a certain off-duty border patrol agent who bravely returned fire and helped disrupt the attack and saved so many lives, border patrol.
And I also want to thank Mayor Steve Voss, we had a great conversation and Governor, Gavin Newsom, had a great conversation and we stand together. We will all get to the bottom of it. We're going to get to the bottom of a lot of things happening in our country. Together, we're building a new chapter of American greatness.
One, founded on the idea that all citizens are entitled to live in safety, prosperity, and peace. This is an exciting time for our great country. This is an exciting time for America. Just yesterday it was announced that the United States economy grew some people thought unexpectedly, not me, I didn't think.
In fact, frankly, if we had the Obama interest rates low, almost nothing, actually nothing. And if we had quantitative easing instead of tightening, we used this conservative approach. We would have been even much higher than this. But this is very high. Far greater. First quarter is always for the most part, it's the lowest quarter.
We did 3.2% in the first quarter GDP, crushing expectations and accelerating our economic growth and that was with a shutdown, that was with a lot of different things, that was with bad weather that was with everything you can imagine. Three point two in the first quarter, usually the lowest and worst quarter.
And Prime Minister Abe, where negotiating trade deals because every country has been ripping us off for years. And I really like the prime minister, he's a friend of mine, but I said, "Mr. Prime Minister, we've got to do something." For so many decades we've been losing tens of billions of dollars to China and Japan, and India, and name any country and we lost, but we're not losing anymore.
And I said, "Listen, we got to do something." $68 billion in trade losses over the last four, five years a year. So we're renegotiating, and I think you'll be fair, I think you'll be fair. And by the way, he started by saying that he's putting $40 billion into the United States for new car factories. Toyota's coming in with $14 billion, many, many companies are coming in. And they're coming in, frankly to Michigan, they're coming back, they want to be back to Ohio, to Pennsylvania, to North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and what's the name of this special place?
It's called Wisconsin. So they'll be investing very shortly. And it's started already 40 billion with a B, $40 billion, and it'll be a lot more than that. The poverty rate for Wisconsin families has reached the lowest rate in 22 years. The unemployment rate for Wisconsin workers has reached historic lows, never been this low before ever, ever, ever, think of that.
Never been, historic low, and we're now the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world and it's not even close. By the way, Saturday night, is there any place that's more fun than a Trump rally? Can you imagine Sleepy Joe, Crazy Bernie, you look at the candidates, right? I think Pocahontas, she's finished, she's out, she's gone.
Now, when it was found that I had more Indian blood in me than she did. And then it was determined that I had none, but I still had more. That was the end of her 32 year scam on colleges. But can you imagine any of these people up here doing what I'm doing? There'd be 200 people show up if they were President, if they weren't President, nobody would show up. Is that right?
And I have to say, I was saying on the way over, they told me about bad weather, by the way, we may have to cancel tonight. I said, "Are you crazy?" Now can you imagine? I learned this morning, they thought you could have a big snowstorm, right? A big, big snowstorm. The people that get it wrong, the most are the weather forecasters and the political analysts.
Now they said there's a big, big storm, it's going to be hitting Green Bay. we may have to cancel. I said, "like hell, we're going to cancel. People are standing out." People are standing out 24 hours ago, 32 hours ago outside, who stood out there for 24 hours. Thank you. We love you. Thank you. Thank you.
And you know what, and you're rewarded with the best seats in the house, right? That's right. America's future has never been brighter yet the Democrats, those very friendly people in Washington have never been angrier than they are today. You see, somebody else with a very low level of energy we're supposed to be standing here instead of me. They wouldn't be in this room.
I don't know they've got some problems, I would say that. But you know, if you look, two weeks out in 2016, I was going to rallies we were doing five and six like this, and there were thousands of people outside just like there are right now. We had 69,000 people sign up to come in. What is this place on like ten or twelve or whatever, whatever it holds, we set the record.
I just was told by the owners, where's the owner? Nice guy. I don't know what the hell it holds, but we just set the record. Where's the owner? Is this your record? Thank you. Whoa, thank you. It's always dangerous. He said yes, it is sir. It's always dangerous. He goes, "No, sir." I'm dead. They will take -- they will take that answer and that will be headline.
Thank you very much, you saved me. Now this is the record, we set records everywhere and it's not me. There's a movement like we've never seen in the history of our country. But the radical liberal democrats put all their hopes behind their collusion delusion, which has now been totally exposed to the world as a complete and total fraud, the greatest political hoax in American history, really has been.
So this witch hunt was never really just about me. It was always about stopping you, the millions and millions of freedom-loving citizens, who rose up on that incredible November day. Remember that day? November. And demanded a government that puts America first, OK? And we're doing that with China, we're doing that with India, we're doing that with Japan, we're doing it with a great new trade deal, that hopefully will get approved in the house.
I hope they're going to approve it because it's great for the farmers, everybody wants it, everybody loves it, but we're all signed up and getting ready, I guess in 30 days to put it in, the USMCA, like the song YMCA, right, you remember? USMCA, that's with Mexico and Canada, it's a great deal and it's going to be very really good for manufacturers and really, really good for the farmers, that's what we want to do. Put a lot of pressure on your Congressmen and your Senators because they have to ratify it. You know they have to approve it and frankly, with what you have today, maybe they'd rather have us have a loss than do something that's good for the country, right?
Because NAFTA is one of the worst trade deals ever signed in the history of our country. You look at around Wisconsin, but you still see the scars, empty buildings. You up to New England, you go to Ohio, you go to different places, NAFTA was a disaster. And what we had, the one thing I wanted more than anything else, I want to make it almost impossible for a company to leave Wisconsin and leave other states and go to Mexico and go to other places, but go to Mexico, fire its workers, open a new plant in Mexico, hire other workers and sell the equipment into the United States.
I don't want that. And we're not going to do it and if it makes it virtually not economically viable, that's what I want. So it's gonna be great. I hope we can get Congress to get it approved quickly because it's going to be fantastic for everybody in this room and especially manufacturers and farmers and people aren't going to be firing people and moving their plants to other countries.
Remember that spell we were going through before I was a politician, remember? Can you believe I'm a politician, I can't even. Politician. But you remember that spell where everybody was just leaving the country and going into Mexico, Canada, Mexico, Canada and Canada has been taking big advantage of your agricultural products, you know that.
You know Canada, we love the song, Oh, Canada, let's sing Oh, Canada, right? We love the song, but I came up here a year ago and I was with farmers and they were selling specialty milk. Now you're getting killed for years. Two hundred ninety seven percent tariff, that means you can't sell it, that's essentially putting up a barrier.
So all of those things are taken care of in this new deal and you're going to be opened up and said, oh, it's gonna be good for everybody. It's gonna be good for everybody and if they didn't approve, I would've just put tariffs on the cars they would have done that. I didn't want to do that. I didn't want to do that.
But I said, "If that's not gonna happen, we're putting tariffs on the cars, and frankly we'll make more money, but the farmers wouldn't be helped so much. But you watch the company grow and prosper as you start." That's no good, right? So we like it and it's good actually it's good for Canada, it's good for Mexico, it's good for us. We've got to get Congress to approve it. So put a lot of pressure on these geniuses we have over here.
That's going to be a great trade deal. And we're very close to making a deal with China, but who knows? I always say, who knows because who the hell knows? The deal is either going to be a great deal, it has to be. I told President Xi, he's a friend of mine. I said, listen, this can't be like a good deal for both.
This has to be a deal because we have been losing to China for many years, $500 billion a year. We have rebuilt China. We've given them so much. Well think of it. Let's cash, you know, they can say it's surplus, they can say it's deficit, call it whatever it is, we will lose it cash. We're giving them five hundred, how the hell can you do it. And as Prime Minister Abe said to me today, he said nobody's ever talked to me this way from our country.
True. No, he said it friendly. He -- he said it friendly, he's a friend of mine, but he said nobody from this country, no president has ever said this. You know, nobody ever even talked about it. We lose 75 billion a year. Japan, as an example, sells us their cars, the cars come in, no tax. They don't take our cars.
Other than that it's a very fair deal. So the cars come in. Essentially, it's two and a half percent, but essentially it's not tax. Our agriculture, they don't want it. We want to sell the agriculture. So they sell cars, we sell practically nothing. That's how we have these massive imbalances with so many countries.
Now China's the big one, because with China it's at least $375 billion year deficit. Think of it. three hundred, who the hell wants -- who made these deals? It's true. Honestly, in all fairness to Obama, this was him, but this was before Obama, a long time before Obama, this has been going on for a long time and all I'm telling you is if we don't make a deal we're going to do even better, OK. We have all the cards.
Don't forget, we're the piggy bank that everybody's robbing. We're -- we're the ones, we're the piggy bank that everybody is stealing from and robbing and taking advantage of. But no matter how hard they try to stop us, they can't because our love for America will always be stronger than a corrupt thirst for power.
This -- I don't -- I'll tell you what, you know, people say, oh, he's wants to take over the country. He wants to extend, they don't believe I'm leaving in six years. He wants to extend, he wants to have a presidency for life. These are sick people. I promise, at the end of six years, I'll be very happy but you're going to be left with the strongest country you've ever had.
I promise you. You're right, USA, we love USA and that's right. And that's what this fight is all about. We're taking on the failed political establishment and restoring government of, by, and for the people, it's the people, you're the people, you won the election. And if you look at what's happened with this scum that's leaving the very top of government, people that others use to say, oh, that's one that dirty, these were dirty cops, these were dirty players.
You take a look at what's going on. There's 21 of them already and I'm not even doing that, just leaving because they got caught like nobody ever got caught and then a truest sense of the word, what we are doing now is draining the swamp, that's true. I mean, we're draining the swamp, but are we having a good time or what?
And look at all those beautiful red hats and some white ones, some white ones. Look at that. Those are a lot of red hats but you do have the white ones too, right? And you have the black ones too, you have a lot of them, you have a lot of different hats but let me just say, so we have to make a decision, you want to make it tonight.
So we're doing great, the country is doing great. We're rebuilding our military. We're doing so many things, listen, so we have a decision to make. We may have the greatest theme in the history of politics called Make America Great Again. It's called MAGA country, MAGA country. It's called MAGA country. You know, I didn't hear that term until that third-rate actor in Chicago went out and he said, "I was beaten up by MAGA country.
Can you believe it?" Now that's a hate crime, right? He said he was beaten up by MAGA country, turned out to be a total lie, but think of it, MAGA, Make America Great Again. And by the way, I have to tell you, that case in Chicago is a disgrace to our nation. Disgrace. So -- so we have a decision to make.
Now, if this weren't the greatest thing -- I really believe that it's been said, but make America Great Again, Ronald Reagan used seldom Let's Make America Great, close but not the same. Let's, apostrophe s, you don't want the apostrophe, it's too complicated, doesn't work, but Ronald Reagan was good. He said Let's Make, but he didn't use it and we use it a little bit.
We seriously use it, right? MAGA. And MAGA we got for free because my whole deal was Make America Great Again, all of a sudden people to say go and #MAGA, but we have a choice to make and a decisions to make. So very shortly we're going to say, you see what we did with our vets, we have choice, we're going to go over, we have accountability where you can find -- We have a lot of things, OK, we've done so much.
Our military is like going to be very soon in great shape. We took 100% of the caliphate in Syria. Everyone said, "Oh, you're never going to be." And by the way, by the way, and when some whack job, that picks up something over the internet goes out and blows up a store and people get killed, I understand that happens.
I understand because these people are sick, they're demented. But we nevertheless, in terms of a war, we took 100%, but you're going to have these cells and they're going to do damage. And it's a shame and we've got to stop them. We've done a great job, but we've got to be careful. We've got to be good, these are sick, horrible human beings, if you even call them human beings.
So we've got to be careful. And you know what, when you see -- and I say this because we have a massive television rights. Do you ever see so many cameras? If somebody else were here, you'd have about like none. It's like the Academy Awards used to be before they started hitting us and their ratings started falling like a rock.
True. So we have a choice tonight. Ready? So Make America Great Again. The problem is we've made America great. We're going to have a couple of things to do. We should have had health care, but one man decided to vote against us at the last moment. That was -- even though he campaigned for eight years repeal and replace, but that's OK, that's OK because we're coming up, we win, we're coming up with a great package of health care.
We're going to be the party of health care. We're coming up with a great package after the election. We've got to take back the House. We've got to win the Senate, we've got to win the presidency, we're going to have bread, but we got rid of the individual mandate. That's the big thing that the worst part of it. So here's what our decision is, do we use, for the new campaign, which will be starting soon, we have the great Sarah Huckabee over here. Sarah?
Thank you, Mr. President. Obviously, I thought it was going to be a little warmer here in Wisconsin, but it's pretty hot in this room tonight. Thanks to -- Thanks for the amazing things you've done for our country last year. This night, I was on a slightly different event, not quite the best welcome. So this is an amazing honor.
I'm so proud to work for the President. They said he couldn't win in 2016 and he did. They said that he couldn't make our economy better and it's booming. They said he couldn't rebuild the military and he's done it.
They said there was collusion and there wasn't. They've questioned him at every step and he's proven them wrong every single time because of all of you. Thank you, Mr. President for leading our country. Thank you.
Oh, she doesn't get it. She doesn't get it. She doesn't understand me after all these years. She's becoming too popular. I'm jealous, Sarah, you're fired. She was wondering what was that all about. She's been great and Dan Escovedo and Mike and the whole group and Madeline, everybody, what a group. What a group.
No, they're great people and they really love this country and what they've been through -- they've been through a lot. They've been through a lot of phony stuff. The witch hunts, they've been through a lot. So we're delighted to be joined tonight by many incredible Wisconsin Republican leaders. A really great friend of mine, a man who is really the focus of what's going on in so much of Washington.
A very tough guy, very strong guy. I call him Wisconsin tough and I don't even know if you know it and I don't know if you appreciate it, but I'm telling you he's really good. Ron Johnson. Thank you, Ron, a great job. He's doing a big job now, I can tell you that he's working on some things that are very important.
And members of Congress, Bryan Steil. Bryan. Thank you, Bryan. Glenn Grothman. This guy, every time I introduce him, you know I love champions. I don't care if it's in sports. I just like champions. So he's your tree-climbing champion, you know, [Inaudible] for five years, and that's not easy. He'd go up and come down.
He said the hard part was coming down because you'd get killed if you missed. But for five years he was the champion, the world champion, five years. And he's with us tonight and I'll tell you, he's our champion, he fights so hard. He's working on a reciprocal trade bill. So if somebody charges us a tariff of 100% or 50% or 25%, we say thank you very much.
We're going to have a reciprocal tax of 25 or 50 [Inaudible]. What could be wrong with that? And he's leading the charge and he's got tremendous enthusiasm but he's a great guy, and he's a great champion. Sean and his wife, by the way, is better than him. Sean Duffy and another great friend of mine somebody that's been so effective, Mike Gallagher.
Mike, thank you again. Thank you. Thanks, Mike. And thanks also to Wisconsin house majority leader, Jim Steineke. Jim, thank you, great. Oh, Wisconsin. Senate President, Roger Roth, Senate Majority Leader, Scott Fitzgerald, thank you. These are great people, they've done so much for us. So we have other leaders in the room, but we all know who they are.
They've been incredible. The Republican Party has been incredible after just the first two years time. America is winning again and America is respected again all over the world, no more games, all over the world. Since the election, we've created more than six million new jobs. Nobody would believe that.
If I said this, when I came here often, I came here often. Remember I came and they didn't like certain people that were with me, they booed the hell out of those people, but they like me, that's all that matters. If I would have said six million jobs we're going to create, by this time two and a half years, can you believe how time flies?
Two and a half years already. I said the other night, I remember, first night, standing in my bedroom, I should say our bedroom, with our great first lady, I said, "Do you believe?" First night, I said, "Here we are, here we are, in the White House." And four years sounded so long away and now four years is coming up with two and a half years and no administration has done as much as we have in the first three years, every.
So -- Thank you. And by the way, yesterday was our first lady's birthday and people love her. We're about the same age, very close. But if I would have said that we would be a two and a half year creating six million jobs, people would have laughed 600,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember, President Obama said manufacturing jobs are gone.
You need a wand, a magic wand. We found the magic wand because they're coming and they're coming fast, and those are great jobs. There's a great -- in the state of Wisconsin alone, we have created 23,000 brand new manufacturing and construction jobs, a record. And after years and years of declining wages, wages are rising for the first time in 21 years.
And you know what's nice, because I have a couple of friends here, they're pretty wealthy people, very successful people, and you know what the hell with it. I don't care. I care about everybody. You know what I love? You know what I love? I love the fact that wages are rising fastest for the lowest income Americans, for single jobs.
You know when they say it hasn't trickled down, the most success percentage wise, the most successful are the lowest income Americans, there's something great about that. And people that are now able to go out, you know, we got Veterans Choice. We also have employment choice because you never had a chance yet to stay in a job that you hated or you couldn't get a job.
Now you can go out, you have seven alternatives, you get a job that you love and you get much higher salaries, it's great. And you've heard me say this a hundred times, but I say it again and I'll keep saying it, "The unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country." And remember this, if I make any mistakes, if I'm off by just a little tiny bit, those people back there will be headlines.
So I have to be very careful, fake news. They're fake, they are fake, they are fakers. I'll tell you, you know what sucks, their ratings suck because people don't believe in them anymore. We have cut 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the federal register, that's an all time record, It's never happened before.
We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in our nation's history. And you know something that is very important to me and very important to -- because of you, to keep family farms, ranches, and small businesses together in the family. When you pass on and go to heaven so you can look down at these great children and you don't like your children, don't listen to what I'm going to say.
Probably a couple of you out there just say, you know, "I don't like a kid. I'm not leaving them my damn farm, right? Anybody in here like that, raise your hand. No don't. But on the assumption that you love your kids, and you love your family, and you want to leave the farm, you remember what used to happen.
The estate tax was 45, 50, 55%. They had to go out and borrow money and sometimes the land is worth more than the income and they couldn't do it in the banks end up in the banks fight them, and that's not what they do for a living, the kids, and they lose the farm, they lose the ranch, they lose the small business, right?
Well, we have eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax on all of those things. Zero. Zero, that's a good one. After decades of calamitous trade deals that stripped away our wealth, literally stripped away this country's wealth, and our jobs and so many other things, took away our dignity when great companies would leave the United States for another country because of stupid taxes because of stupid regulations, because frankly, in some cases and the unions are going to work on this, I tell them, "You've got to work on this, you've got to have a little flexibility because there are other choices." But now the choices are going to be other states.
They're going to be competition. But you know what, now, America fought back and all of these companies are coming back into our nation again, they want to be where the action is. They want to be where the action is. They're all coming back, all of them. And the era of economic surrender is over. That's what we did.
We would like -- You remember that I used to do it when I was a civilian when I had no idea, I was going to be running for president, right? I had no idea. I used to say what the hell is going on in Michigan. They gave me an award six years, seven years ago. I had no idea. It was the man of the year in Michigan.
I went to Michigan, I said, do you people know what's happening? You're losing all your car companies, they're all leaving. They're going to Mexico, Canada, they're leaving. They're going to China. You know what the hell is -- And this was before I was thinking about running for office. But I've been saying it for 20 years and now we've stopped it. Those companies are all coming back straight.
When the Wisconsin timber industry was threatened, my administration took immediate action. We impose tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products and saved countless timber jobs all across this great state. And you know that, you know that John, big difference, right, they were losing -- you were losing a lot of jobs and they were taking the timber from other states and other countries, nope, not anymore, we're doing good.
Before I took office, one of the greatest threats to the future of American manufacturing was the previous administration's Trans Pacific Partnership. You think NAFTA would have been bad? This would have made NAFTA look like a good deal. The TPP would have decimated U.S. manufacturing and gutted America's auto industry, would have gutted the industry and they were dying to do this crazy deal.
I also ended up another one, you know, the great Paris Accord. How -- how's Paris doing lately? How'd Paris? How's Paris doing? Send all the money to countries that the people never heard of and raised their taxes. I ended that one too. I thought I was going to take a lot of heat on that one. Saved a lot of money, saved a lot of jobs, saved a lot of businesses.
I said, you know when I end this Paris Accord, I'm going to take heat. I didn't even take heat. My people understood it, it was a ripoff. It didn't allow us to use our wealth, would have stolen our jobs, but just take a look at what's happening to other places where they're trying to do it. And we had something we would have never ever been able to adhere to the rules, they were so strict on us. You know, China can sign rule. They're not going to be sued by Greenpeace.
If Greenpeace goes to China, that's the end of Greenpeace, you never see them again. So China doesn't care if they violate Greenpeace and some of these other wonderful environmental groups. But the United States get sued and we adhere to these things. It's a little bit different. We would have lost our ass on that deal.
That would have been a terrible deal and that's why I was willing to take the heat, but there was no heat. I'm still waiting. I guess at some point they'll bring it up. They'll probably bring it up. Bernie Sanders will say, "What?" I'll say, "Take a look at Paris on a Saturday afternoon, Bernie, how they doing over there?
Good?" The yellow vests, how are they doing? I don't think so good, and they're great friends of mine, but I don't think they're doing so good. That's why in one of my first acts as President, I withdrew the United States from the one sided job killing disaster known as TPP. TPP, what a mess. That was another one of these deals that was set up for the strict purpose of taking wealth out of the United States for the benefit of those other countries that were in the deal.
It was a one sided horror show. America will not be taken advantage of any longer. For years we gave foreign nations free and unfettered access to our economy while they constructed massive barriers to American exports. We give them, you come in, take us, Joe, it's wonderful, we want to go there. No, we don't do that, we don't accept your product.
Oh, that's wonderful. As one example, we charge other countries, zero tariffs on foreign paper products, but when Wisconsin paper companies export it abroad, they sent their product abroad, China charged us big tariffs, India charged us big tariffs, Vietnam charge us massive tariffs. Unfair. Reciprocal trade act, John, reciprocal trade act.
Look at Harley Davidson. Look at Harley Davidson. I met with them three years ago, one of my first meetings, Harley Davidson. And I said to the people are very nice. They would tell me tough to do business in certain kind -- "How you're doing in India?" and they said, "Oh, we don't do any business." They weren't even complaining because so many years.
So India charged a 100% tariff on a Harley Davidson, but when they send their motorcycles and they make 'em, to us. We charge them nothing. So I called up Prime Minister Modi, I said unfair, he cut it 50%. But he said that's not good enough because look, it's 50% to nothing. And what we're doing is changing all of that stuff, changing all of that rapidly, rapidly change.
And that goes for military protection also, that goes for military protection also where we are getting ripped. We're defending the world, we're defending wealthy countries that can well afford to pay us, but they've been getting this free military or at least massive partial subsidies for so many years.
It's almost like habit, it's more habit than anything else. Nobody does anything about it, but we do. There's one country we lose $5 billion. I won't say it. I don't want to embarrass anybody. The last thing I want to do is embarrass somebody, but they lose. We spend $5 billion a year defending them, right.
So I said to the generals, "How much do we spend?" they say, "Sir, we spent $5 billion." Very wealthy country. I said, "How much do they pay?" "Sir, they pay $500 million." I said, "You mean we lose four and a half billion dollars to defend it?" And they're rich. So I called the country, right, I called the country.
So we lose four and a half billion for the privilege of defending a country. That's very tough on us on trade and various other things. So I called, I said, "Listen, no good." Now that we're in a state of shock because they never got a call like this in twenty five years. So I said, "It's no good. We're losing four and a half billion dollars.
It's no good. We can't do this anymore, this is crazy." And he got very upset. Angry. "This is not fair." I said, "Of course it's fair." He said, "Well, we'll give you 500 million more because the budget you see had already been set, there's only a month left." So you know, I said, "You know what, I want more." We argued.
So they paid us more than 500 million for one phone call. It took me one call. Now I'm not bragging, I hate the deal. For one call. Ron knows. First call they've had in 35 years. I don't think they've had a call. One-sided horrible deal. So I said, "It's OK. You know, I understand you have budget. You know you go through a budget next year, which now turns out to be in about two weeks.
I said we're going to call you for much more. You got to pay, you got to pay, not fair. We're defending you and you're rich." You know, we can defend people. They're not rich and they're being horribly treated and human rights and all the sudden that's different. These are rich countries, but think of it, one phone call, we pick up 500 million, that's not terrible, but now we're going to pick up a lot more and we have that with many countries.
Look, Saudi Arabia, very rich country, we defend them. We subsidize Saudi Arabia. They have nothing but cash, right? We subsidize and they buy a lot from us, $450 billion they bought, you know you had people wanting to cut off Saudi Arabia, they bought $450 billion, I don't want to lose them. But the military, we subsidize Saudi Arabia, I called the king, I like the king.
I said, "King, we're losing our ass defending you King and you have a lot of money." That's true. And he said, "But why would you be calling me? Nobody's ever made such a call before." I said, That's because they were stupid." So we're working to deal with Saudi Arabia and so many so many things. So many things.
I'll tell you what, honestly, it's easier than collecting a hundred and thirteen dollars and 57 cents from a tenant in a bad location in New York City and it's safer too. It's easier, it's true, it's easier. OK, enough of that, but it's true. So we're getting ripped off on trade, we're getting ripped off on military, by NATO, i'm all for NATO, but you know we're paying for almost 100% of defending Europe and they're killing us on trade.
The European Union, the EU is killing us. We lost $181 billion and we're defending them for peanuts, it does -- does it -- does this make sense to you what I'm saying? And in the meantime, your taxes go up, although they actually because of me have gone down, so I -- The International Trade Commission recently announced that under the USMCA American dairy exports to Canada are expected to surge by more than 50%, OK? We got to get the deal done.
Ron, you got to get that deal done. You'll get it done. Got to get it done. In my first 100 days in office. I traveled to this very state to sign an executive order, declaring that we will live by two simple rules, "Buy American and Hire American", right here in Wisconsin. But while we are unleashing America's economic renewal, the new agenda of the Democrat Party is not the Democratic Party sounds, but they are to change the name it's much better.
But why should I make their name sound good, right? The Democrat Party, radical left, they should change that too, call it, officially, The Radical Left Democrat Party would drive our nation into economic and financial ruin very quickly and they will take your guns away too, by the way. Nothing is more dangerous than the Democrats, crazy immigration agenda.
We want it solved. We're building the wall by the way. We're gonna have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. You know, we can get money for anything. They were willing to give me money for every single thing, more money than I wanted. I said, I don't need that much money, give me money for the wall.
We're not giving you anything for the wall. You know why? Because politically they don't like it. So I went out and did it a different way and we have the money for the wall and we're building the wall because their entire party has been taken over by far left radicals, who want to nullify and erase American borders.
They want open borders. They want open borders. They want people to pour in and they think that's going to be votes ultimately for them. These left wing extremists don't believe America has the right to enforce our immigration laws or decide who gets to enter and remain in our country, not going to be that way.
And think of Border Patrol, we apprehend a hundred thousand people a month. You know what that is? Democrats want to allow totally unlimited, uncontrolled, and unchecked migration all paid for by you, the American taxpayer. The Republican Party believes America has not only the right, but the absolute duty to control our borders and to enforce our laws.
And we believe the immigration system must put the needs of American workers and families first and people can come into our country. We need people to come in. We have so many companies coming. They need workers, but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit and we will always support the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol.
These are great heroes. Last month alone, 100,000 illegal immigrants arrived at our borders, placing a massive strain on communities, and schools, and hospitals, and public resources like nobody's ever seen before. Now we're sending many of them to sanctuary cities, thank you very much. They're not too happy about it. I'm proud to tell you that was actually my sick idea, by the way.
No. Hey, hey, what did they say? "We want them." I said, "We'll give them to you. Thank you." They said, "We don't want them." Yet -- Well, wealthy liberals preach open borders, they live behind gates and guards, they send their families to the best doctors and private schools and while pushing immigration policies that drain the public services every day citizens depend on you and they depend on you, I depend on you because we can change our immigration laws.
I used to say in 45 minutes, it's really 15 minutes, it's so simple, but we need Democrats to vote on it, otherwise we can't change it. And they don't want because No. 1, they don't want to give us a victory, we're going to take it anyway. We're going to take the victory, anyway. But they don't want to give us a victory on that issue.
And No. 2, they don't mind open borders and obviously open borders bring tremendous crime, they don't mind crime, if you can believe. The border crisis is also driving, and very strongly, the drug crisis, the biggest crisis we have, drugs, it's people, and it's drugs, and it's traffickers, cartels, traffic, huge quantities of heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl across our southern border.
Drugs that claimed the lives of 80, 90, and maybe even 100,000 people a year and ruin the lives and the families of so many more. To confront the border crisis, I declared a national emergency. The good news is everybody agrees. Everybody agrees. Now, everybody's in. They look at those caravans -- We just had a caravan for 20,000 people and we told Mexico, I said, "Listen, if you let those people come through your country, we're going to close the damn border.
We'll close it. I don't care." They got to bring them back. They got to bring them back. Humanely, they got to bring them back. The flood of illegal migration is the direct consequence of Democrat backed policies that prevent border violators from being promptly returned home. They're allowed to stay in our country, Catch and Release.
They're allowed -- you catch them and then you have to release them. It is crazy. Congress has to fix these horrible immigration laws. We have to end human smuggling, stop human trafficking, shut down sanctuary cities, deport criminal aliens and replace visa lotteries and chain migration with immigration systems based on skill, and talent, and merit.
Ron Johnson's going to do it, Ron, congratulations. Stand up, Ron. Will you get that done for me, please. No get it done for Wisconsin, OK. He'll do it. He'll do it. On issue after issue, the Democrat Party has never been further outside the American mainstream. I mean it's crazy what's going on with them.
Oh, do I look forward to running against them. They are pushing a $100 trillion government takeover of the US economy, known as the Green New Deal. We're going to rip down every single building in Manhattan and build a new building in it's place. They've introduced a total federal takeover of U.S. health care that would abolish the private health insurance of 180 million Americans.
Many of you are in this room right now. And they are aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mothers womb right up until the moment of birth. And just this week, your Democrat governor, and by the way, by the way we have Scott Walker, he's here. Great governor, he did a great job, he's a great governor.
He's got a big future. But your Democrat governor here in Wisconsin shockingly stated that he will veto legislation that protects Wisconsin babies born alive, born alive. The baby is born. The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby, they wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.
I don't think so. Incredible. No, it's incredible. Until this crazy man in Virginia said it, nobody even thought of that, right? Did anyone even think of that? Yeah, late term. But this is where the baby is actually born, it came out, it's there, it's wrapped and that's it. Who believes it? So to protect innocent life, I called on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting the extreme late-term abortion abolished.
So Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, hoaxes, and delusions. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans, that's what it is, it really is, and common sense. We're a party of common sense. We're the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, we're the party of the Second Amendment and its protection.
And every day we are making good on the motto Promises Made, Promises Kept. We are. Last month I signed an executive order -- Where's Charlie? Where are you Charlie? Charlie? Where is he? What a great -- The man. He's like 14 years old, I can't believe. How old Charlie? Twenty five. Can you believe? This guy's unbelievable.
What a job. In honor of him, he worked so hard. And for those of you who think that youth is a [Inaudible] our side, just look at this audience tonight. Look at what Charlie has done, you'd be amazed. I was watching the other night, the NFL draft, can you believe it? And it was the second-draft choice and he gets out most and he gets a real -- he's gonna be a great player from Ohio State and he's a MAGA fan.
He loves Trump, he loves MAGA. We got a lot of young people out there. You want to know the truth. I actually think we have more than they do, who knows? But I think we have more than they do. He's going to have a great career. Last month, I signed an executive order to defend free speech on college campuses.
And if they don't give free speech they lose billions and billions of dollars and that's OK. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs. So Important. Last year prescription drug prices went down for the first time in 51 years. OK, it's going up, up, up. And it's down a lot more, going down.
That was a big deal, not by much, but you know it's always gone up a lot, 18%, 6%, 9%. It went down and it's going to start going down because all of these very complex things that we're doing are starting to kick in. We're going to get them down. And maybe on that one, we're going to work with the Democrats to be honest, because they want to get it down too and we'll see if we can put it all together.
But prescription drugs, look, it's a rigged system, OK, if I told you how crazy it is, the Web, it's the Web, you need 193 I.Q. to even understand this web of geniuses. They put this thing to lower drug prices. It has 19 effects here and 27, so we got it down and we're getting it down further. We have the smartest people, the best people in that world working on it, and it's happening.
And we might be able to get Democrat support. We're vastly expanding affordable alternatives to Obamacare. We repealed Obamacare is unfair and very unpopular individual mandate. Well, you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having health insurance, that was very bad. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
The Republicans are always going to protect pre-existing conditions. We're unleashing American energy and getting Washington bureaucrats off the backs of hunters, fishers, farmers, and everyone who enjoys our great outdoors. And we've committed to providing -- I think you'll like this, and Ron, there's great Congressman that you have in this room are working hard on it, we're very close, $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and we're building the new Soo Locks to protect jobs and commerce throughout the entire Midwest.
And I'm pleased to report that earlier this Interlake Steamship Company announced plans to build the first Great Lakes freighter in 35 years, just north of here, in Sturgeon Bay. How did you know? 35 years. And that just means more jobs, more jobs, more jobs. To keep America safe, we are rebuilding America's Mighty Mite.
We are rebuilding our military like never before in the history of our planet. That includes brand new combat ships from Marinette and more than 6,000 brand new armored vehicles from Oshkosh. And we're boldly defending American interests. Just yesterday, I announced that my administration is unsigning the UN Arms Trade Treaty.
We're unsigning it, we're pulling it back out of the United Nations. We're pulling it back out of Congress. All of you Second Amendment people, you know we know what it is. We'll be very happy because we will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on America's freedom. We're not going allow it. That was a President Obama disaster.
I also withdrew the United States from the absolutely horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. What an impact that's had. You know, when I first became President, the first week, I met with our great military people and we went over problems. One of the biggest problems was there and they were all over. Iran was all over the place they were over -- I've never seen anything like it, 14 different conflict zones, Yemen, Syria, all over, and small battles.
I said, "So what do you do with these people?" I withdrew from that horrible deal where they paid $150 billion to Iran. They paid 1.8 billion in cash, probably for hostage. By the way, I got 22 hostages out. And the other day our great hostage negotiator made the statement that Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator this country has ever had.
So you know what, so I put it out, I put it out, why not, you know a lot of times if you're not going to brag about it, nobody else is, you might as well do it. True. So our ambassador made this happen and the press picked it up and they were going after me. It's not true, it's not true, and then he called them and he said no, it is true.
And instead of saying it's true, they stopped talking about it, fake news. I recognized Israel's capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and it would have opened in 25 years. What I said to our great ambassador, David Friedman, one of the most successful lawyers in New York, who became ambassador to Israel.
I said, "David, they want to spend $1.1 billion, we could do it cheaper." They want to buy this piece of land in Jerusalem, top dollar. I said, "David, what can we do?" And he called me back, he said, "Sir, we have a piece of land that's much better, and on that piece of land, we have an old building. We're not using the building very much and we can renovate the building for $400,000 and we'll have a beautiful embassy and a better location, and we can have it done and so we can have it done in four months instead of 25 years." So here's your alternative, a building at a great location in four months for $400,000 or a building that will probably never get built, but let's say 20 years.
For 1.1 billion today, meaning $3, $4 billion in a lousy location. That won't be as good as what we built and it's the first time I've had ever done this. He said four hundred thousand. I said, "David, it's too cheap." We have to make it. It's true. I said, "Make it $500,000." It's true. It's True. And it's open.
We opened it like almost a year ago. And you know in New York I have a friend who's a very successful guy. He's very proud of his office because he used to think, oh, Jerusalem stone. This is stone from Jerusalem, it's one of the most expensive. He considers it a treasure. And every time I go in he says, oh, look at my beautiful stone, it's from Jerusalem.
So we're building a building in Jerusalem. I said, "David, do me a favor, buy Jerusalem stone. You're right there." We got it so cheap, you wouldn't believe it. And the whole damn building is made practically of Jerusalem stone. It's true. It's beautiful. So we got it open it for months instead of 20 or 25 years.
And we saved at least 1.1 billion and it's a great embassy right now. It's a great, great thing. It's great. And just weeks ago I announced that the United States will recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. So that's been under consideration for 52 years. For 52 years, they told me they've been studying it. They've had summits many, many meetings summits, people coming from all over the world talking about the Golan Heights and then they'd leave.
This is very important strategically for victory, heights. You're up high, very important. Fifty-two years ago it started and I did it quickly, done, it's all done. And we also recognize the legitimate governments of Venezuela and we strongly condemn the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime. And you see what socialism does, that was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, now it's one of the poorest.
And to those who would try to impose socialism in our country, we see nothing but trouble. We see nothing but poverty. And we will say again tonight that America will never be a socialist country ever, never, never. Great. Wow this crowd has a lot of [Inaudible], this is a hell of a crowd. Saturday night for having a good time.
And you know why we're having a good time because we are talking about a subject that we love, The United States of America, it's very simple. Each of us in this arena is united by the same timeless values we believe in the American Constitution, and we believe in the rule of law, we believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life.
We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country to honor our history and to always respect our great American flag and we believe in the words of our national Motto, In God We Trust.
These are the traditions, customs, and principles that unite people all across this beautiful state of Wisconsin. These are the values that bind us together as citizens, as patriots and as Americans, you joined our movement, the greatest movement in the history of our country because you rejected the failures and the betrayals of the past, you were betrayed.
You were betrayed by dishonest people. You were betrayed by stupid people. You served down a corrupt system that enriched itself at your expense. You protected your family, you defended your dignity, you recaptured your destiny, and you took back your country with that great election two and a half years ago.
You have always been loyal to this nation, now you finally have a president who is loyal to you. Every day between now and November 2020, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are going to win. Remember, I used to tell you about winning, we're winning.
We are respected again and I have to say, every leader, without fail, that comes to see me in the Oval Office, they all say congratulations. It's incredible what's happened to the United States, and I'm not just talking about economically, which is tremendous. We've created $12 trillion of value since the election, $12 trillion and our primary competitor, very big, powerful competitor has lost $17 trillion since our election.
They were catching us. If somebody else were in this position, they would have caught us already, they're not catching us now, we're way out in front. With every last ounce of hard and hope and sweat and soul we are going to make our stand. We are going to stand for liberty. We are going to stand for justice, we are going to stand for freedom and we are going to stand for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God, we are one united movement, one united people and one United States of America.
And together, with the great and proud people of Wisconsin, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to Greenville, North Carolina. I want to thank you. And to Mike Pence. Done a great job. Great Vice President. Thank you, Mike. And we have all night. We have a lot of fun tonight. I have nothing to do. Nothing, nothing. We have nothing to do but make our country great again and that's happening fast.
It's wonderful to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of hardworking, North Carolina patriots, and thank you for your support. And thank you for that very big victory we had three years ago. Time is flying. You're getting ready? Let's do it again, right? Let's do it again. I just heard that the United States House of Representatives has overwhelmingly voted to kill the most ridiculous project I've ever been involved in. The resolution, how stupid is that, on impeachment.
I want to thank those Democrats because many of them voted for us. The vote was a totally lopsided 332 to 95 to 1. 332 to 95. Think of it, we have the strongest economy in history, the lowest unemployment numbers ever. We've rebuilt the most powerful military. It was totally depleted when I took office and now it's rebuilt.
We passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts of any President or any administration in history. We took care of our great vets, including Veterans Choice and Veterans Accountability, and they want to try and impeach, it's a disgrace, it's a disgrace. So now we have that behind us. And I have to say this, and I'll say it just once, what happened to me with this witch hunt should never be allowed to happen to another President of the United States, never ever again.
And I want to thank Republican leadership for what they've done for all of us by stopping that hoax, the Russian hoax, I call it. Because America is winning again. America is respected again, and because we are finally putting America first. Our economic policy can be summed up in three very beautiful and simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.
We've created six million new jobs since election day. If I would have said that nobody would have believed it. If I would have said that, the fake news would have said he's exaggerating. And I wouldn't have said it because I wasn't even sure we could do this. Think of it, six million jobs since Election Day.
And by the way, North Carolina has had its best economic year in the history of your state. Our country has added more than 180,000 people to the workforce, and think of that, through what we've done on a federal basis, you picked up over 180,000 thousand jobs, North Carolina. Think of that. And you have the lowest unemployment rate.
You have a lot of good things. But let's not talk too much about North Carolina. Let's win this election nationwide. You remember North Carolina? That was going to be the Clinton firewall. She spent a fortune here, and I kept coming in and coming out. They call it earned media, I earned it. I kept coming in and coming out and every time I left, I said I don't think we'll lose in North Carolina.
You know what, I was right. We won it, we won it so. So, I just want to thank everybody. Seriously, this is a big -- that was a big deal. November 8. That was a big deal. Donald Trump has won the great state of North Carolina. The big deal. That was when you started to see the folks at a certain -- other convention, beautiful looking place.
One of the most beautiful venues I've ever seen, but I don't want any part of it. It was unlucky. I don't want any part, but that's when you saw the people say, "What the hell is going on?", "What's happening?". And then it was state after state it was Florida, it was South Carolina, we love South Carolina, right?
It was Pennsylvania. Remember, they wouldn't announce the numbers in Pennsylvania, so there was 1% of the vote remaining. If I lost every one of those votes, we still win by luck, and they wouldn't announce it. They wouldn't announce. And then we won the great state of Wisconsin, first time in many, many decades, not a Republican.
And then we had a surprise but not a surprise to us, because we're bringing back the auto industry, brought so much back to the great state of Michigan, that was a shocker, remember that? You remember a certain hand on that beautiful board, and they said, "You know, this Ford is getting awfully red." That's Republican.
There's a lot of red up there. We had a lot of -- that was one hell of a night, wasn't it though? I think it was -- maybe you know there are those that say one of the most extraordinary and exciting evenings in the history of television and the history of anything, and you know you can go? All over the world, in some cases it was morning you go to Asia, you go to Europe, you go all over, it was just record setting.
And here's the point, we have to do it again. We have to do it again. And the reason we have to not only to do new things, which we will. And you know, statutorily, and we had all sorts of artificial witch hunts over our head. Can you imagine? If we didn't have to go through that hoax? I don't know that we would have done any better.
To be honest with you, I think we've done more in two and a half years than any president ever -- first two and a half years. But could you imagine what it could have been if we didn't have the witch hunt? You said it. I won't say it because it's a terrible -- it's a terrible word. So I will not say that this guy said, "If we didn't have the bullshit." No, no. Could you imagine if we didn't have the time wasted, the time and everything.
Can you imagine? And you know a friend of mine said? Maybe you wouldn't have done as well. Is that possible that can happen? Maybe we would have had too much time on our hands. Who knows, but I can say nobody in their first two and a half years has done anywhere close to what "we" not me, what we've all done.
So the unemployment rate among African-Americans is the lowest in the history of our country. Unemployment, among Hispanic-Americans, where we're doing really well. You know why? Because they want a strong border, they want it because they understand the border better than anybody. They want that strong border.
They want that wall, that's being built right now. They want that wall, and they really do. They understand the border better than anybody. And they don't want criminals coming in, they don't want crime coming. They don't want to lose their jobs. They like the fact that their salaries are going up, their wages are going up. They understand it better.
So Hispanic-American, the best unemployment numbers in our history, Asian-Americans, the best unemployment numbers in our history. And likewise, women, 74 years, I'm sorry, women, I let you down. It's not in our history, but we're going to be there very soon, we're going to be there very soon. Women are doing incredibly.
And we men, the men are going to get angry. Sorry, man. Whoa, look at all those signs. Women, Women for Trump. Well, thank you. It's a lot of signs. You remember last election? Donald Trump will never ever get the women. Then we get this tremendous number of women. We've got this tremendous number of women and during the election night they said, "What's going on?", You know what it's called?
Suppression polls. Suppression. Polls are just as fake as the news itself, but women filled 60% and I'm sorry to tell you, these men, they are going to sue me for discrimination now. Women fill 60% of all of the new jobs created last year. Women took 60%. What's wrong with you, man? But the radical Democrats are trying to destroy all of our country's tremendous achievement and our country's tremendous success.
Unprecedented. We've had unprecedented success. Leaders come in from other countries. Prime ministers, presidents, kings, queens, dictators, sometimes, I hate to say it dictators. And they all start off by saying, "Mr. President, I'd like to congratulate you on the incredible economy that you've created, the greatest, anywhere in the world by far.
And sadly, China, who I have a very good relationship with. President Xi, I really like him, but China has had, yesterday it was announced, the worse year in 27 years, and we've had the best. And if our opponent ever got into office, instead of being up 62%, instead of those 401(k)s of yours being up 60, 70, 80, 90%. Crash.
Big crash. You would have had a crash, the likes of which we have never seen before if they got in office, because we freed up our country, we freed up our economy with -- especially with regulation cuts, but also with those big beautiful tax cuts. We freed them all. The leading voices of the Democrat Party are left wing extremists, who reject everything our nation stands for.
But again, I have to tell you, this vote was so big. I have to thank many of the Democrats. I mean, that was amazing. No no. I really do, I respect it. I really do. That was a -- that was a slaughter, but many of those people that voted for us this afternoon is somewhat of a sneak attack, a real sneak attack.
Many of those people that voted for us were Democrats, and I want to thank them because they did the right thing for our country. Republicans know that America is the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of our world, but these left wing ideologues see our nation as a force of evil. The way they speak so badly of our country.
They want to demolish our Constitution, weaken our military, eliminate the values that built this magnificent country. You have to look at some of their recent comments, which you never talked about. When you see the four Congresswomen. Oh, isn't that lovely? I'll give you just a couple. I have pages and pages, but we don't want to bore you.
We wouldn't want to go too long, but we have to give a couple because that's the great thing about live television, they can't cut it. Representative Ilhan Omar of a really great state, I almost won the first time in decades and decades, Minnesota. Great state. By the way, I keep hearing how much enthusiasm is in the radical left.
I don't think they have enthusiasm. They're just fighting with each other. We have all of the enthusiasm. He goes home now to mommy and he gets reprimanded and that's the end. Sorry, mommy. Sorry, mom. Didn't mean to embarrass you, mom. But it's true. We have the enthusiasm, folks. Look at this, look at this.
And by the way, thousands and thousands of people outside, and people that couldn't get in, thousands. We've got all the enthusiasm, they're fighting each other. They've gone so far left. Nobody wants to even think about it. So Representative Omar blamed the United States for the terrorist attacks on our country, saying that terrorism is a reaction to our involvement in other people's affairs.
She smeared U.S. service members involved in Blackhawk Down. In other words, she slandered the brave Americans, who were trying to keep peace in Somalia. Omar minimized the September 11th attacks on our homeland, saying some people did something. I don't think so. Some people did something. Yeah, some people did something, all right.
She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits attempting to join the terrorist organization. She was looking for compassion. Omar left that Americans stick of Al-Qaeda in a menacing tone and remarked that, "You don't say America with this intensity. You say Al-Qaeda makes you proud. Al-Qaida makes you proud." You don't speak that way about America.
And at a press conference just this week, when asked whether she supported Al-Qaeda, that's our enemy, that's our enemy. They are a very serious problem that we take care of, but they always seem to come along somewhere. She refused to answer. She didn't want to give an answer to that question. Omar blamed the United States For the crisis in Venezuela.
We think of that one and she looks down with contempt on the hardworking Americans saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country. And obviously, and importantly, Omar has a history of launching vicious anti-Semitic screeds. And she talked about the evil Israel and it's all about the Benjamins, not a good thing to say.
So, that's Omar, that's Omar. And by the way, many other things, all you have to do is press the right button on your beautiful screen and you'll see thing of -- you didn't hear this over the last two days, or did you hear anybody talk about that? Her colleague, Representative Rashida Tlaib agreed with Omar's characterization of 9/11 and said that members of Congress who support Israel forgot what country they represent.
And Tlaib also used the F word to describe the presidency and your President. Isn't that nice, even for me, she was describing the president of the United States and the presidency, with the big fat vicious, the way she said it, vicious F word. That's not somebody that loves our country. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Check out her scores by the way with her new green new deal, the green new deal. Where did that come from? She's conducted outrageous attacks against men and women of law enforcement. She compared American border agents managing a humanitarian crisis that I always said was a humanitarian crisis, and they said it was manufactured.
They don't say it was manufactured, and we're stopping it. And I want to thank Mexico. They've got 21,000 soldiers now stopping people from coming into our country. But Cortez, somebody said that's not her name. They said that's not her name, sir. I said, "No, no. I don't have time to go with three different names.
We'll call her Cortez." Too much time -- takes too much time. So Cortez also, she said, "Essentially, Nazis are running concentration camps. And when Mike Pence went down just a few days ago with members of Congress and the media, and you looked at those so-called horrible concentration camps, they said, "Wow, these places are clean.
Wow, they have air conditioning. They have water. And you know, to be honest, it's not like they came and we want to take care of people. We got to straighten out our immigration laws." You know in a very short period of time, if the Democrats would give us a few votes, we could solve the immigration problem and it would be so great.
But these kids and these people come from rough places And I'll tell you what, some of them said, "We've never lived like this before." They have water, they have air conditioning, they have things that they've never seen, and we listen to her talking about drinking water from toilets, which was a lie, which was a lie.
Cortez said that illegal immigrants are more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be. Can you believe that? That's what she's saying. She described contemporary America, that's you, that's me, that's all of us, as garbage, garbage, a garbage, Remember Deplorables, right? That sounds worse, I think, that's worse, but we'll save it for whoever is going to be the nominee.
And right now, sleepy Joe's, not looking too good. Pocahontas -- Pocahontas is gaining a little bit because we probably use the Pocahontas a little bit too early. But that's OK. We'll bring it out of retirement very soon. They have a new one who knocked the hell out of Biden during a debate. He said I wasn't prepared for that question.
That's not a good answer. Can you imagine? And according to the polls, I won every single debate, Republican and against Hillary. Can you imagine -- those are the polls. They won't admit that, many, many polls. But can you imagine if I said, "Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't prepared for that question." I'm -- I'm gone, That's the end of Trump.
He's not prepared. He's not mentally prepared. That's his problem. But everybody that knows him knows that. But no, Harris hit him with a pretty easy question on busing. What? I would say, that's pretty easy. And he choked. He choked and then he said, "I'm sorry. I ran out of time. He ran out of time. And then you have a young guy, Buttigieg, Buttigieg.
They're saying how to say his name, boot edge edge. He's a beauty. He runs a failed city. His city is doing so badly. Mike Pence was the governor of that state. I said, "How do we see us as the mayor?" Mike is one of the nicest human beings you'll ever meet. He said -- And Mike said, "He never did a good job.
I'm so shocked to see him running." OK. And then he goes back home and African-Americans literally were so angry at him for the lousy job, and he's supposed to be like a hot, young star. If that's a hot, young star, I guess, I just don't know stardom anymore. That is not a star. That's not a star, boot edge edge.
You say boot, and then add edge edge, Buttigieg. I don't see him dealing with President Xi of China. I don't see him meeting successfully with Kim Jong un. I don't see him dealing, and nobody has been tougher with Russia than Donald Trump. I don't see him deal with Vladimir Putin, and we have good relationships with them and many others, except now we're no longer the suckers.
Like with NATO, we protect Europe. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and they're not paying their fair share. So last year, I went and said, "Folks. Sorry, you've got to pay your fair share." Sixteen years, it was going like this, the contribution, And now it's like a rocket ship, $100 billion. And I said to him, great people, 28 nations, including the US, I said to him, "Listen, we're taking care of you.
You screw us on trade and you don't pay your military bills. This is not a good deal for the United States." So we're taking care of trade. We wanted to do it nice and slow and easy. You know we had a world balance, but the European Union is terrible to us on trade, terrible. Frankly, they're as tough or tougher than China, just smaller numbers.
That's the only difference. With China, $507 billion dollars. As you look over the years, for many, many years, they've been taken. And guys like Biden say, "Oh well, we'd stop it." Well, he was there eight years, we'd stop that. No Trump is stopping it. Trump is. So Representative Ayanna Pressley, is she related in any way to Elvis?
I don't know. Who knows? You never know? She thinks that people with the same skin color, all need to think the same. She said we don't need any more brown faces that don't want to be brown voices. We don't need black faces, that don't want to be a black voice. And just as we -- can you imagine, if I said that?
It would be over. Right? It would be over. It would be over, but we'd find a way to survive. Right? We always do. Here we are. Here we are. We find a way, that always find a way. Just this week, she refused to condemn the AntiFa. These are bad people. You notice -- You notice they always attack people that really have never been attacked before.
They attack, and I don't want to be disrespectful to people that have taken a lot of shots to the face, but they wouldn't attack some of these people in this room. They're not attacking bikers for Trump. They're not attacking construction workers for Trump. They're not attacking law enforcement or military for Trump.
They're attacking a single man standing there with a camera, who never got hit and never hit back before in his life. They don't attack the people that we wish they attack. That wouldn't be a pretty picture. That wouldn't look -- that wouldn't look too good for them. But they don't, it's very, very sad. AntiFa, these are bad people.
These are sick, bad people. Remember that. These are bad people. These are bad people, AntiFa. They don't get the bad press. The press doesn't want to talk to them. They are very evil. They're hitting people over the head with sticks, and I mean sticks. I mean, bats even. They're whacking people with bats.
They're very brave. They always show up with a mask and they're covered, because then they go home to mom and dad. They don't want mom and dad to know where they were. But they always attack people that really can't defend themselves very well. Right? They're not attacking this group. They're not attacking North Carolina.
So these Congresswomen their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left. But that's OK, because we're going to win this election like nobody's ever seen before. And tonight, I have a suggestion for the hate-filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down.
They never have anything good to say, that's why I say, "Hey, if they don't like it, let them leave, let them leave." Right? Let them leave. They're always telling us how to run and how to do this. How do -- you know what, if they don't love it, tell them to leave it. I don't know. And now watch, I'll go back tonight.
Oh, sir, that was so controversial, sir. No, I'm just saying it's their choice. They can come back when they want. But you know they don't love our country. I think in some cases, they hate our country, and they're so angry. Even yesterday, they were on the stage. I said. Let me watch this and the anger.
They were trying to be nice. But it's hard -- it's hard for them to do that. The choice for every American has never been more clear. That's true. The Democrat agenda is anti-worker, anti-jobs, anti-citizen, anti-family and anti-common sense, with the exception of all of those Democrats that voted for us today.
We'll give them -- they're fine. They're fine. They are fine and they, you know, you lose to them. It's different. It's OK. It's called normal political back and forth. But I want to tell you something, the Democrats are being so vile and so vicious moving so far left, it's out of control. It's out of control.
The Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100% pro-American. So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by several North Carolina Republican leaders, really great people. They've been so helpful to me, and they're doing an incredible job. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, North Carolina treasurer Dale Folwell, Greenville Mayor P.J. Connelly.
I hear he does a good job. Good job. And North Carolina GOP Chair Michael Whatley. I want to also thank and I'll tell you he's been a warrior for the last three months, really a warrior when we need him the most, Senator Thom Tillis. Thank you, Thom. He really is. He's been really good and we've got to get out and work and make sure he gets re-elected.
And also Representatives Mark Walker and Richard Hudson. And two friends of mine that decided you know they had a choice. They could stay back and fight the hoax of impeachment or they could be here and bask in the glory of victory. I said, "Do me a favor, stay back. Mark Meadows and Mrs. Meadows is here right now.
Debbie's here. Thank you, Deb. These are warriors and another one who's just incredible, NCAA wrestling champion, great guy. He wanted to stay back. I said, "Are you sure you don't want to come?" "I do want to come, but I really want you to win today. If you don't mind." I said, "OK, let's you better stay back.
If I see you here, I'm going to be very angry." And they did their job, didn't they? This man is from the great state of Ohio, Congressman Jim Jordan. And we're going to do this quickly, but it's just important that you get out and vote. They're two great people. I want to introduce the next member of Congress from North Carolina's 3rd congressional district, just won a great race, Dr. Greg Murphy.
Greg is a winner.
Thank you, President Trump, for coming back to eastern North Carolina. This is Trump country. And I promise, if elected your congressman, I will be a congressman that has our President's back. The 3rd district -- the 3rd district is not going to elect another Pelosi Congressman. It is not going to do that.
So we thank him for coming in eastern North Carolina, and we are here to support him. Thank you, all.
So you know, Greg will be great on jobs, all the things you want, tough on crimes, stronger on borders, pushing the wall. He'll be pushing it like nobody, but we're building the wall, but we're pushing it. It's like pulling teeth. We've got six lawsuits on the wall. We've won two of them. We're going to win others.
But you think it's easy, don't you folks? You think this is easy, but we're building a lot of wall and we hope if we can win that final one, so important, it's going before the Supreme Court, we'll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. So go out, get Greg elected. Great victory, by the way.
That was a great primary and a great victory. That same day, there's another crucial election in North Carolina's 9th -- You know, right? You know what we're talking about night. I know it's not here, but it's very close. Right? 9th Congressional district, the Democrat in the race is an ultra-liberal named Dan McCready, wants to take away your guns.
He wants to raise your taxes. He doesn't care about borders. He likes open borders, and he really admires socialism. I don't think that works too well in North Carolina. It doesn't work too well in our country. We're joined tonight by the Republican candidate, who is really a special man, a great man. He's gonna be a great, great Congressman Dan Bishop.
Dan?
So, as President Trump said, there are two Dans in this race. Dan McCready said that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to democracy ever and backed crooked Hillary. Dan McCready took money from Ilhan Omar. And Mr. President, Dan McCready wants to repeal your tax cuts. Now, he would be the wrong Dan. As for me, I'm going to go to Washington and I'm going to stand with President Donald J. Trump, and that makes me the right Dan.
And with the help of President Trump, we're going to win the 9th District. So go to votedanbishop.com and sign up. Thank you.
Thank you, Dan. Thank you, Dan. And he will indeed defend your values, your family, and he will always defend our Second Amendment. Unlike their opponents, they're really into destroying our Second Amendment. So everyone from the 9th District, go out and vote for Dan Bishop, a very special man, two very, very special people.
On the issue of everything, a lot of issues, Democrats have put the needs of foreign citizens far ahead of our own citizens. Nowhere in this world is there anything like what's happening with immigration, how bad it is. The Democrats, open border policies, deplete our public services, overcrowd our schools and hospitals, and bring crime, drugs and deadly gangs into our community.
The Democrats want to spend more money on health care for an illegal immigrant than they do for a citizen of the United States. So, just two days ago, our Department of Justice charged 22 members of the savage, brutal, horrible gang MS-13 in California, who've been violently operating for more than 10 years.
We got them all. We think they are no good with conducting brutal, medieval-style killings. You know what medieval style is? The little pieces, little pieces, little pieces, medieval style, including the dismemberment of their victims, and they enjoyed every minute of it. These are sick people. When I called them animals, Nancy Pelosi said, "How dare he use that name.
These are human beings." I don't think they were humans. Most of those indicted were in our country illegally, 19 to be exact, 19 of 22, think of that. They want to protect -- These are savage beasts. These are savage killers, and they should have been brought out a long time ago by the Obama administration.
We're bringing MS-13 out by the thousands, getting them the hell out of our country. And when you read about deportation and Sunday, you get a lot of people on Sunday, but we have a lot of people and we're always shooting for the bad ones first, which makes sense. Right? But when you hear about that, we always want to get -- And by the way, do you know how dangerous it is for these ICE agents, these ICE and border patrol?
But ICE, they go into a nest. They call it a nest, a nest of these killers. They're tough. They're smart. And you know what? They're great patriots. They love our country. The danger that they have is incredible. And I just want to salute -- And I have to tell you, I want to salute ICE and border patrol.
And I want to support -- I want to support and salute law enforcement in the United States. These are -- are great people. These are great people and they don't get the credit they deserve. But you know what? I tell them all the time, you have no idea how much the American people, the American public, you have no idea how much they love you and respect you, law enforcement.
In the recent Democrat debate, every single candidate, everyone -- Biden was a little bit slower with the hand. It didn't work so well. They raised their hand in favor of giving free government health care. They raised their hand in giving a lot of other things that I don't think you're going to be happy with.
Illegal aliens will be very nicely covered. How about California? They just approved $100 million. They just approved $100 million to take care of the needs of illegal immigrants. And then you look on the sidewalks of Los Angeles, the sidewalks of San Francisco, Nancy Pelosi's district, nobody's ever seen anything like it in the history of our country what's happening there.
So if you don't want Democrats to raid your health care, to steal away your money, to bankrupt your country, then you have a choice. You must vote Republican. All American citizens, including millions and millions of legal immigrants who work hard to come into our country who study, who wait in line sometimes for 10 years, and who respect our laws and follow the rules, they deserve a government that is loyal to them.
They work hard. You can't say you love our country if you want to destroy it through open borders. Open borders are a disaster. Human trafficking, you know, the first time I heard as a politician human trafficking, nobody talks about it. It sounded almost like an ancient crime, many many years ago, hundreds of years, thousands of years ago.
Human trafficking is the worst now throughout the world, because of the Internet. It's the worst that's ever been. And the worst treated of all, children, but it's women, women. The Democrats want to do nothing about it. Human trafficking is worse than it ever has been in the history of the world, not just -- This is not a United States problem.
This is all over the world, human trafficking. It's a terrible, terrible thing and we're going to solve it. You know most of it comes through in this country, our southern border, where we don't have the wall. They're not going through our points, they're not going through areas where we have security, where we have guards where we have gates where we have all sorts of equipment.
No, they ride through the desert and they make a left, where you don't have the wall. It's so simple. Everybody knows it. You know, the Democrats all know it because five years ago, before I was here, they all wanted it. Now they don't want it. You know why they don't want it? For political reasons. And you know what?
It's going to cost them a lot of points in the election, I think probably cost them the election. And just lastly, Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities, which release violent criminal aliens onto our streets. You know, where we just picked up these 22 thugs, these 22 monsters, we just picked them up in, where, Los Angeles, sanctuary, city, wonderful sanctuary city.
Thom Tillis, senator, recently introduced a bill to give American victims the right to sue sanctuary cities and hold them accountable for the thousands of lives they have shattered. They've shattered these lives. Thank you very much, Thom. Every nation has the right to establish and enforce immigration rules in its national interest.
It's very simple, isn't it. It's common sense. It's so simple, and the voters understand it. We expect that those who seek to join our society will obey our laws, revere our Constitution, cherish our history, support themselves financially, and embrace our American values and love our American flag. We believe in an immigration system based on merit, merit where they come in. We have so many companies coming in, automobile companies, companies of all types, and we need workers.
We actually need workers. We have the lowest unemployment rate that we've had in 51 years. Soon, it'll be the lowest ever. We need workers, but they have to come in where they can help our country. They have to come in based on merit. And we're putting in bills, and let's see what happens. Otherwise, we'll just wait 'til we win back the House, win the Senate, win the presidency, and we'll vote.
Democrats have never been further outside of the mainstream. They're going crazy, folks. They're going crazy. More than 130 Democrats in Congress have signed up for Bernie Sanders, total government takeover of health care. Isn't that nice? This is one of the great -- It won't happen. He knows that. You know the guy never passed the bill.
He did -- He did nothing. He's actually not even a Democrat. Is he an independent? I don't know. He's running -- but he missed this time. Hey, Bernie, let me save you a lot of time and effort, Bernie. You missed your time. It got taken from you four years ago, Bernie. Not doing too well. He's not doing too well, but that's OK. You've got to hand it to him, he's up there ranting and raving and going like a lunatic.
I said to our first lady the other day, I was watching Bernie and he screamed. And his hair's all crazy. We're going to do this, I'm going to do that, no more college loans, no more costs for anything, nothing, not -- You're not going to pay for anything. I mean, he's desperate now. He's desperate. You don't have to pay for anything.
You know, I joked, I said, and everybody will get a free Rolls-Royce. Every family gets a free Rolls-Royce, every family. And the media said Donald Trump is exaggerating. He knows that they're not getting a Rolls-Royce, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Don't put it. Don't put it. Don't put it. Don't put that I said free Rolls-Royce.
No, but Bernie's desperate now. I watched him up there. It's a sad situation. But I think they're all sad when you get right down to it. For instance, OK, we're in this incredible state, North Carolina. You have your best economy that you've ever had. Forget the country for a second. You have the best economy you've ever had.
You have your best unemployment numbers. You have the most people working than at any time in the history of your state. You have your best black unemployment numbers, best Hispanic unemployment numbers, best women unemployment numbers, best Asian unemployment numbers. OK. OK. Alright. So -- so what's my -- whoever the opponent is, what are they going to do say North Carolina, I'm going to do a great job.
You have the best numbers in the history of our country in your state. So I don't know. And we won by a lot. And we won by a lot. You know, I was telling Mike, I was telling my son, Eric Trump, and Lara's here, by the way who was born in North Carolina, oh, they do a good job. Lara, do you love this state?
And her brother's here. I have -- I have to tell you, he went to this college and Brad Parscale is here, the world's tallest campaign manager in the history of the world. He's the tallest in the history -- but most importantly, he's the best. World's tallest manager, but he's the best manager. Thank you, Brad.
Great job. And he just told me, our poll numbers are through the roof. He just told me that, so I'll take that. I mean, we are a year and a half away, but we're doing well. You'll see it. You'd know. You'd be the first to know. No. 1, you wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be here. We haven't had an empty seat in any event, I don't believe, that we've ever been to. I don't think, we've ever had -- we've always had people -- we haven't had an empty seat.
You look, I mean, anywhere in North Carolina, Ohio, no matter where we go, we pack it. And we have thousands and thousands of people and we put screens outside and tonight's not so good. We've got 100 degrees out, but you still have thousands of people out there. We could have sold this arena out. You know that.
We could have sold this arena out tonight 10 times. Can you believe that? Ten times. Which I think that's like a poll. Right? That's like a poll, 'cause when Biden goes out, I see sleepy Joe. He says they had 115 people show up, 115 people. That's our first row. That's our first row. The Democrat record on health care is one of deception and destruction.
The last administration said a lie. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor 28 times, a total lie. My administration is defending your sacred right to choose the doctor and the plan that you want, and we are offering plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare.
And a lot of people are starting to figure that out, better health care. I will also always protect peace. You have to remember this, are you ready? Because they give us a bum rap. Patients with pre-existing conditions are protected by Republicans much more so than protected by Democrats who will never be able to pull it off, pre-existing conditions.
And you know the job we've done on health care, it's not talked about, but we're also doing something. It's been phenomenal. We have 180 million people right now, really happy on private plans. And you know what? They're going to be taken away. Under the Democrats' plan, all of those people that are thrilled when they went out and negotiated across state lines, all of the things they did, they went out negotiated great private plans are still going to be taken away from you under this plan.
Now, I only hope they don't change, because you know we're talking too soon. We've got a year and a half left. It's like when I called Pocahontas, Pocahontas. I should have waited six years because she then went out and got that test, 1024th. And I've always said, I have more Indian blood in me than she has in her and I have none.
I have none. But it's more than she has, 1024. But I brought it up too soon, so I don't talk about any more. But if she should be the candidate, which I tend to doubt, but if she should be, we'll bring it up again and I think it'll be very successful, 1024. How about this? I was driving her crazy, so she went out and hired a guy to check the blood.
I'm sure he had a lot of fun doing that. He checked her blood and found out that many, many, many, many, many, many years ago, there could have been somebody. And he could have been Indian. And then the Indians got together, and they said, "We don't want her. We don't we want here. We want Trump. We want Trump.
They want Trump." They've taken historic action. So we've taken historic action to fight the opioid epidemic, what a problem. And just today, it was just announced before I came in, that drug overdose deaths, we're working so hard on this, including our Vice President, including our first lady, including everybody in the Trump administration, it's dropped for the first time in more than 30 years.
It's gone down. First time. And in North Carolina, we're far from finished. It's a big problem. It declined 8% last year. That's a lot, because it was just going up like a rocket. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth.
Well, then, you have the gentleman from our governor from Virginia, so we're talking about late term. He's talking about the baby is born before the mother makes the decision. That was the first -- that's the first I've heard of it. That's the first most of you have heard of it. And then they pass legislation in various states saying that's OK. This is a baby that's born.
This is late term. This is a baby that's born. Nobody's ever heard anything like that. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. And that actually, when he had the scandal, that became, can you believe it, the second biggest story? Can you believe that how important it is, and yet that was the second biggest story.
And what a shame when that's the second biggest story. What happened to our values? Republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift of God, and that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion of babies. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, intolerance and division.
The Republican Party is the party for all Americans and American values. We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream. This is the proud banner of the Republican Party will carry into the Republican National Convention next summer in the great city of Charlotte, North Carolina.
Don't disappoint me. That should be good for at least 10 points, right? These are some of the greatest ladies. I see them in Ohio and Florida. We love you too. Thank you, really. How many have you been to? Just out of -- What's the number? All but two? I've done hundreds of them. And then they say women don't like Trump.
I think they do. You know, I see them, they're great. Great ladies. You're great. You know it's interesting with women, so women want to have strong military protection. They want to have strong borders. They want to have strong law enforcement. They want to have great education. They want to have low taxes for their family, not high taxes.
They want to have all the things that we talk about. Why wouldn't they want Trump more than anybody else? The other side is gonna go on the other side. And they in the last election and we're doing a lot better. You know the difference is, the last election, I was a successful businessman running for President, I said I was going to do things and by the way really successful.
I'm gonna show you something someday soon. I'm going to show you something. You know they say he was really successful. He wasn't successful. He's really smart. He's really stupid, but he's trying to take over the world. You know, they have so many messages. He's really stupid. Then next week, Donald Trump has a sinister plot to take over the world.
You can't be too stupid, because they actually think it's working. Right? I saw one of these so-called comedians the other day, and he's, you know, a pretty respected comedian. He said he's not leaving. I'm telling you he's not leaving, he'll never leave. He'll win this election, and in 24, I'm telling you he's not leaving.
He's going to stay. So we did, through our friend, Dan Scavino, we did a Time magazine cover. I was on so many Times. I don't even read this thing. And it says Trump 2014-2018. Right? But it says 20 -- Here's where we go. We started 16. We go to 20. We go to 24. Did you see it? Then it says? 28, 32, 36, 40, 43. No, we don't need any more time.
We don't need any more time. We need one more. Senator came to my office, "Sir, I'm 67. I'm great. I'm 67, sir. I can give you great advice." I said, "Senator, I'm one for one, but it happened to be the President. And now I want to be two for two, two for two." Two for two. So we have 16, we have 20, we have 24. And you know, it's very interesting though, they were really people out there think I'm not leaving.
Can you believe it? Hey, maybe that is a good idea. Let's think about it. What you want to drive them crazy? They're going to go crazy. All I have to do is say, let's think about it. They're going to go crazy. No, no. I promise -- I promise 2024, I leave. By that time -- just so you know, by that time, our country will be so well-seeded, it will be so strong like never ever in our history.
But everything that we've built, low taxes, strong military, taking care of our vets, all of the things we've done can be decimated very quickly if the wrong person gets in, especially now -- You know, I've always said 2016 was the most important election, maybe in the history of our country. A lot of people thought that.
So I don't know. I can't say this is more important. What we did was a miracle. Not to us, it wasn't. But a lot of people said it was the greatest election we've ever had. There's never been anything like it. Never been such exciting, never been such exciting. But you know what? If we don't win in 2020, everything that we've done -- seriously, though, everything that we've done, your 401s, they're going to crash, the whole thing it's going to come down like a stack of cards.
So in a certain way, let's say this is of equal importance. By that time, we'll have values instilled. We'll have free enterprise instilled. People are working now, we have the lowest food stamps that we've had in many years, lowest food stamp because people are working. So I really think it's, you know, at least equal, it's equal, maybe it's a little less, who the hell knows.
I just know this, it can disappear very, very quickly. We have to get out, we have to vote. That's why I'm starting early, I mean we -- Can you believe it? We have less -- I mean, I see all these clowns on television, so I guess we have to counteract them a little bit. But this is not what you want. Right?
None of them. This is not what you want running this incredible country of ours. Every day, we make good on the motto promises made, promises kept. I've had people back there. I've had people back there that don't like me, and somebody said very nicely that he's actually made certain promises and he's actually kept more promises than he's made.
It's true. I mean, I've done things -- I've done things that I never -- I never said we were going to get as an example with our vets, that we're going to get Choice, that we were going to have the ability to fire people that don't treat our vets properly. OK. We can fire them now. They've been trying to get that for 44 years, Choice said been trying to get practically from the beginning, Choice so simple, and yet they never got it. Nobody got it through.
We're good at getting things through. We've done more than we said we would. And a man I know, who I don't like, a businessman very, very, very successful businessman, one of the most successful. But I don't like him, never liked him. He never liked me either by the way. In fact, I would go a step further.
He couldn't stand me. And I saw him about two months ago, and he came up to me. I said how you doing? Very warm. You know, hey. How you doing? Let's get out of here. And he said I'm doing good, you're doing good. I said, yeah. I said, you know, you don't like me and I don't like you. I never have liked you and you never have liked me, but you're going to support me because you're a rich guy.
And if you don't support me, you're going to be so goddamn poor you're not going to be [Inaudible]. And he said to me, Mr. President, you know, he calls me Mr. President. Everyone calls me Mr. President. It's true. It's a funny thing. He said, Mr. President, you're right, I'm supporting you. I think you're doing a great job.
And maybe we didn't get along, but it's not like he has a choice, he has a choice. And on top of that, it's a good choice, because we've done the right thing. And it is funny, you know, with the name. Mr. President. I have friends, really good friends, and they've always called me Don, Donald, D.J. They call me anything and you lose all your friends when you're president, because they're all afraid to talk to you.
Does that make sense? No, it's true, except -- except for these six, seven ladies up here. They always talk. They're not intimidated. No, it's true. I have guys, I have wonderful friends, New York developers, tough guys, smart guys, they're rich, they're this, that. I have middle of the road, I have poor.
I have everybody. I have poor guys, middle of the road, I have rich guys. Doesn't matter. Rich guys call up, "Mr. President, how are you, sir? Oh, it's Richard." "Oh good, Rich, Hey Richard, loosen up. This is a guy who used to, "Hey, Don. How are you doing? Let's go to dinner." Now, he's, "Sir, is everything doing good, sir?" I said, "Richard, call me Donald like you always did.
Call me Donald. Always call me Donald." "OK. Thank you, Donald. Thank you very much." Then two minutes later, "Mr. President, it's been so great." I lost all my friends. They've tightened up. They've choked. You know what that is? They've choked. They can't breathe because people have such respect for the office of the president.
They have respect for the office of the president. They have respect for our country again. Our country Is respected again. We've confirmed more than 125 federal judges to apply the law as written, including two Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs.
And last year, this is -- I'm so proud of this, because we have no help from the Democrats. Last year, for the first time in over 50 years, drug prices went down. And that was for a reason, to give former prisoners a second chance at life. We passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. It's a big thing.
You know, prisoners, they've gone out of jail and They've never had an economy like this, and we did a lot of things because they get out of jail, they don't have a chance. They always go back most of the time. Now, they're coming out and we have programs. But most of all, we have this great economy where people are hiring prisoners and you have to see the reviews they're getting.
They're getting phenomenal reviews. It's a beautiful thing. It's a beautiful thing what's happening with prisoners. They get out and they can actually get a job and that's what's happening. We're very proud of it. We're expanding opportunity zones so that no American is left behind. It's one of the great successes, the opportunity zones.
Nobody talks about. It's what are the great successes. And thanks to our pledge to America's workers, private sector partners will provide apprenticeships and job training to 9 million Americans. Isn't that nice? And whenever I hear that word apprentice, I say I love that word. That was a good show. They figured, you know what we'll do, we'll get Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place.
That didn't work out too well. That didn't work out too well. We had 14 seasons, think of that, The Apprentice. I've proudly signed for bipartisan human trafficking laws, securing $400 million to support victims of human trafficking, and we have secured, soon to be three years, record funding for our military.
We want to cut budgets, but this is beyond budgets. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided, disgusting Iran nuclear deal and Iran is a different country Today. My administration proudly recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. That was some day, they all said many, many presidents have said we're going to do. Then they never did.
I know why, because the pressure on them was enormous not to do it. And then on top of it, a couple of months ago, I just approved the Golan Heights for Israel, the Golan Heights. Another thing, 52 years they tried to do that, they didn't get It done. So we're doing good. We also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela and we condemn those that want to stop freedom in that country and other countries.
Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country, will never ever be a socialist country. It just won't happen. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream, frankly, the destruction of our country. That's what's going to happen.
Take a look around. Their party is afflicted with an ideological sickness that protects foreign borders, but refuses to protect our own borders. Think of it. They fight all over the world. A lot of those people are coming back home. Folks, they're coming back home a lot. We defeated ISIS, you know the caliphate in Syria.
We're bringing our soldiers back home. ISIS does not like me too much, but I came here. It was a mess. It was a mess. And I met with generals. General -- believe it or not, one general, his name is Raisin. I said, "What's your name?" "Sir." This guy's like out of a movie. "Sir." Well, he's gonna be famous after this, but who cares.
What's your name? He goes, "Sir, my name is Raisin." I said, "Raisin? Like you mean a little raisin?" "Yes, sir. It's my name. That's what they call me." "What's your last name?" "Cane." I said, "You mean your name is Raisin Cane? You've got to be." I said, "Raisin Cane? You're my kind of general. Let me talk to you, Raisin Cane.
Get over here." And my previous generals said it's going to be a long time before we take out the caliphate. I said to Raisin Cane and a couple of other generals that were there, "These guys are central casting like from a movie, except better. They're stronger, bigger, tougher, meaner and actually better looking in a certain way." But they're like from a movie, there's nobody in Hollywood plays a role like this.
I said, "Generals, I've been told it's going to take a year, two years to get 100%." Remember I want to pull them out, we're down to 1%. Everyone went crazy like that one, but they said it's could take a long time. I said to Raisin Cane and the other generals, "Generals, how long can it take?" They said, "Sir, one month." I said, "What?" "We're going to hit them from the front.
We're going to hit them from the back. We're going to hit them from the side, sir. We're going to hit him like they never got hit before. We were never allowed to do this, sir." "And we're not just going to hit them from our temporary base in Syria, sir. We're going to hit them from Iraq. We're going to hit them from places that they never knew existed, sir.
They'll be hit so goddamn hard, sir. They will be -- Thank you very much." Very shortly, very, very shortly, it was over. We had 100% of the caliphate and these people were screwing around for years. Obama, President Obama, my generals did a great job. I flew there. I flew to Iraq, remember? I'm an Air Force One.
And they notified me, "Sir, we're 45 minutes out, sir. We have to close all windows. We have to turn off all lights in the plane, sir. All windows, all lights, have to be off, sir. We're turning off the lights outside and the runway lights, sir. They're going to be in a very dim..." Frankly, if you're not a 30-year-old pilot, you can't See anything.
I said, "I don't see any light, pilot. " As we're landing, I said, "I don't see." And then I thought to myself think of it. We've spent almost $8 trillion in the Middle East and we got to turn off the lights of an airplane to land. How bad is that? They didn't do their job. We did our job and the military did their job.
But we fight to sort of just keep going. We don't fight to win. I fight to win. I fight to win. So we're landing his big, beautiful Air Force One and I'm saying, "Major, I don't see a runway." "Yes, sir. It's right up ahead." You know, guy's 30 years old or something. He says, they'll get me in that. They said maybe he's 35, whatever he is. They're saying, "Yes, sir.
It's right..." "I don't see it, major. How about lifting up? Let's go around." That's the last thing we want to do in that part of the world. He said, "Sir, it's right there, sir." And we're landing, and I still haven't seen a light. But these guys, we have the greatest pilots in the world, we have the greatest military in the world, we have the greatest equipment in the world In the world, in the world.
So you must never forget, the 2020 election is all about one thing, you. It's about you. It's about your family. It's about your future and the fate of your beautiful, loving country. And that's what it is. We begin our North Carolina campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda and the only positive vision for our nation's future.
We love our nation. Our nation is great today. It's going to be much greater. Every year, it's getting better and better. We have turned this big, beautiful, mighty ship. We have turned it around. It's getting better, better, better. Together, we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise, so every American can know the dignity of work and the pride of a paycheck.
With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress, those great gentlemen that just left us there. To create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration, we will enact trade deals and they are going like you won't even believe. That doesn't mean the other countries are thrilled with me. There was a recent poll.
Germany likes Obama better than Trump, a lot better. I said, of course, because I'm making them pay their bills. I'm saying you got to pay. I say Angela, Angela. You got to pay, Angela. Obama would go and make a speech leave. I go and make a speech. I say let me speak to Angela. Angela, you got to pay your bills.
You were behind. So I would think that they should. They should all like him. When you hear they like me better, I'm not doing my job. I'm not doing my job. They did a poll on one of these networks, and there was a Donald Trump is not liked in Europe nearly as much as President Obama. I said -- or President Bush or anybody or anybody.
In fact, I'm just like -- but actually they respect us. That's more important -- look at that beautiful baby. Look at that beautiful baby. Wow, what a baby. What a baby. That is a beautiful baby. It's like from an advertisement, perfect. Look how happy that baby is. So beautiful. Thank you, darling. That's really nice.
It's a great thing. Is that your husband? That's a great thing. Thank you. Congratulations, husband. Man, what a picture. Well, we're going to have the country all set for your child. OK? Because that's what it's about. Now the media will say, that's a prop. They'll say no baby is so beautiful. That had to be a setup.
I never saw that guy in my life, which is true. Thank you. Good luck. Thank you very much. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words Made in America, Made in the USA. Either one is OK with me. Keep America Great. That's right. We will give school choice to millions of underserved children who are trapped in failing government schools.
We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. They're going to take your guns away. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one great nation, as one America, as one America. We believe in the American Constitution and we believe in the rule of law.
We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children, like your child, should be taught to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, In God, We Trust.
We are fighting for every American mom and dad who wants to protect this land of liberty for their precious children. We have been blessed with the greatest republic on the face of the earth. But it was going in the wrong direction, and now we are turning it around. It is going better than ever before, and we're going to keep it that way.
We're going to keep it that way. With your help, with your devotion, with your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning. We are one movement, one movement. Think of that. We are one big, beautiful movement. There has never been a movement like it. They don't hear it that often.
They know it. But you know here in the history of our country, there has never been a movement like this. And this movement is stronger now than it was three years ago. This is the strongest movement in the history of our country. But we are -- we're one movement, we are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
We're doing things that nobody thought was possible. No other nation thought it was possible what we're doing. We are so respected. You have no idea how our nation has gone so far up in the eyes and the minds of the rest of the world, so respected. Because together, we will make America wealthy again. Of course, we did just hit the highest price in the history of the market.
So pretty soon, I hate to say, I don't want to ruin the rhetorical skill, but that is sort of like getting a little obsolete. We will make our nation wealthy again. The fact is, we have the strongest stock market in our history. So I think I have to change it. You've all heard it many times. Right? We will make America wealthy again.
We're gonna have to say we have made America wealthy again. So here's one, we will make America strong again. No, no, we're gonna have to change this. We have made America stronger. And just so you know, we have made America great again, right? We have made America great. We will make. You know the story.
Keep America Great. It's fairly -- You know, look, how do you give up MAGA? How do you give up MAGA? Make America great again, but we've done that. Can you imagine if keep America great didn't work? I had the greatest phrase, probably in the history of politics in this country. Look at her beautiful hat.
Looks very good on you. But look at this -- look at this beautiful hat. But you know make America great again, but we've done that. So we're going to keep it around, because I cannot just out of my heart, the love of that expression, that phrase, it's a great phrase, but our new phrase for the 2020 campaign is keep America great.
Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. It is truly great to be back in the wonderful, beautiful state of Pennsylvania. [Applause] I love this state, and I love the people of this state. It is special, and it carried us to a big, beautiful victory on November 8. [Applause] I want to recognize some of our friends that have helped us so much. Congressman Scott Parent, GT Thompson, a couple of my originals, Mike Kelly, who I watched on television.
He was great. Where is Mike Kelly? Where is he? Boy, were you great on television this morning. And of course, one of our other originals, Congressman Tom Marino. Right? [Applause] Thank you, thank you. As you may know, there is another big gathering taking place tonight in Washington DC. Did you hear about it? [Booing] A large group of Hollywood actors -- [Booing] -- and Washington media -- [Booing] -- are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in the nation's capital right now.
They are gathered together for the White House Correspondent's Dinner -- without the President. [Applause] And I could not possibly be more thrilled that to be more than 100 miles away from Washington's swamp, spending my evening with all of you, and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people. Right? [Applause]...
USA, USA, USA.
And look at the media back there. They would actually rather be here, I have to tell you. [Booing] That's right.
[Inaudible]
Media outlets like CNN and MSNBC are fake news. Fake news. [Booing] And they are sitting -- and they are wishing -- in Washington. They are watching right now, they are watching, and they would love to be with us right here tonight. [Applause] but they are trapped at the dinner, which will be very, very boring. But next year, maybe we will make it more exciting for them in Washington and we'll show up. But we have a good chance of showing up here again next year, too. [Applause]
The truth is, there is no place I would rather be than right here in Pennsylvania to celebrate. [Applause] -- our 100-day milestone, to reflect on an incredible journey together, and to get ready for the great, great battles to come, and that we will win and every case. Ok? We will win. [Applause]
Because make no mistake, we are just beginning in our fight to make America great again. [Applause] Now before we talk about my first 100 days, which has been very exciting and very productive, let's rate the media's 100 days. Should we do that? Should we do it? [Booing]
Because as you know, they are a disgrace. According to a Morning Consult call, more than half of Americans say the media is out of touch with everyday Americans. They've proven that. [Applause] According to Media Research Center, 89% of the media's coverage of our administration has been negative and purposefully negative, and perhaps -- [Booing] -- that's because according to the Center for Public Integrity, 96% of journalists who gave donations gave them to our opponent. And does anyone were member who our opponent was?
Lock her up, lock her up, lock her up.
That was some opponent. Finally, according to a poll last year from the Associated Press, only 6% of Americans have a lot of confidence in America. That is very bad. That is much lower than Congress, by the way. But I will give you an example of something really incredible. [Protestor is escorted out] That's right. Get them out of here. Get them out. [Applause] ...
USA, USA, USA.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] Do we love our law enforcement or what? [Applause] And I want to thank the fire marshals. They have a lot of people standing outside. We really maxed out. We broke the all-time record for this arena. How old is this arena? We broke the all-time record. I don't have a guitar, which is pretty tough. So, ust as an example of media, take the totally failing New York Times. [Booing]
Pretty soon they will only be on the internet. The paper is getting smaller and smaller. Do you ever notice? It is starting to look like a comic book. It's getting... But I will tell you, because I watched, and I used to be in the real estate business, they sold their beautiful New York Times building in Manhattan, a cathedral to journalism. Such a beautiful, beautiful building. For around $130 million, and the group that bought it later sold it for approximately $500 million.
Now they live in a very ugly office building in a crummy location. Next, they buy The Boston Globe newspaper, with lawsuits ,for $1.3 billion and invest millions and millions of dollars to get it going. In the end, they sell it for zero. They give it away. And then they write nasty editorials and op-ed telling me how I should be handling world events. [Booing] But that is what we have. They are incompetent, dishonest people who after the election, had to apologize because they covered it, us me, so badly that they felt they were forced to apologize because their predictions were so bad.
Do you are member their prediction? -- Do you remember their production? They lost a lot of people because of the way they covered. So here's the story. If the media's job is to be honest and tell the truth, then I think we would all agree the media deserves a very, very big, fat, failing grade. [Booing] Very dishonest people. And not all of them. You we call it the fake news. Now -- we call it the fake news. Now everybody is using the word fake news.
Where did you hear it, folks? By contrast, for the last 100 days, my administration has been delivering every single day for the great citizens of our country, whether it is putting our coal miners back to work, protecting America's steel and aluminum workers -- we love that steel and aluminum -- or eliminating job killing regulations, we are keeping one promise after another, and frankly, the people are really happy about it.
They see what is happening. [Applause] But to understand the historic progress we have made, we must speak honestly about the situation that we and I inherited because, believe me, the previous administration gave us a mess. [Booing] For decades, our country has lived through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. You people know it better than anybody in Pennsylvania. Our factories were shuttered. Our steel mills close down, and our jobs were stolen away and shipped far away to other countries, some of which you have never even heard of.
Politicians send troops to protect the borders of foreign nations, but left America's borders wide open for all to violate. [Booing] We have spent billions and billions of dollars on one global project after another, and yet, as gangs flooded into our country, we couldn't even provide safety for our own people. Our government rushed to join international agreements where the United States pays the cost and bears the burden while other countries get the benefits and pay nothing. [Booing]
This includes deals like the one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Where the United States pays billions of dollars while China, Russia, and India have contributed and will contribute nothing. [Booing] Does that remind you of the Iran deal? How about that beauty? On top of that, it is estimated that full compliance with the agreement could ultimately shrink America's GDP by $2.5 trillion over a 10-year period. That means factories and plants closing all over our country.
Here we go again. Not was me, folks. [Applause] Those are the facts, whether we like them or not. The dishonest media won't print them, won't report them because the Washington media is part of the problem. Their priorities are not my priorities, and they are not your priorities, believe me. [Applause] Their agenda is not your agenda. I will be making a big decision on the Paris Accord over the next two weeks. [Applause]
And we will see what happens. But they are all part of a broken system that has profited from this global theft and plunder of American wealth at the expense of the American worker. We are not going to let other countries take advantage of us anymore because, from now on, it is going to be America first. [Applause] and I have to -- ...
USA, USA, USA.
And I have to just interject because, as you know, I have been a big critic of China. And I have been talking about currency manipulation for a long time. But I have to tell you, during the election, number one, they stopped. But more importantly, just to show you the dishonesty -- we have currency manipulation by China -- but China is helping us possibly or probably with the North Korean situation. Ok? It's a great thing. [Applause] and I met with the President of China at great length in Florida. We had long, long talks. Hours and hours and hours. He's a good man.
He's representing China, not us, but he's a good man. And I believe he wants to get that situation taken care of. They have tremendous power, and we will see what happens. But the media said Donald Trump refuses to name China a currency manipulator. Think of this. We have to have a little flexibility. So I meet with the President of China and say, could you help us out with North Korea? You give them 93% of their different materials they need in their food.
You have a lot of power. We have a great relationship. Then the media says, why didn't he call Donald Trump, and why did Donald Trump in the meeting say you are a currency manipulator? So here's the story. Listen, Mr. President, will you help us out with North Korea? But by the way, you are manipulating your currency. It doesn't work, right? So, So... [Laughter] You understand. So instead of saying that, let's see what happens. I honestly believe he is trying very hard. Not an easy situation for China, believe me.
Not an easy situation. But we have somebody there who is causing a lot of trouble for the world. We have China, who is really trying to help. As you have seen, they have set back vast amounts of coal coming to North Korea. So let's see what happens. I think it is not exactly the right time to call China a currency manipulator right now. Do we agree with that? [Applause] But they never say that. So I promise you in my inaugural address 100 days ago that now arrives the hour of action. And believe me, we've started from day one, that is what we have delivered. 100 days of action. Those people and others are exhausted. They've never seen anything like that.
They've never seen anything like this. [Applause] We are ending the off-shoring and bringing back our beautiful, wonderful, great American jobs. [Applause] We are eradicated the criminal gangs and cartels that have infiltrated our country. You are reading about them all the time. Some of you have big problems with them. Thank you for that sign, Blacks for Trump. I love that guy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, man. That is great. That is really cool. I appreciate it.
And we are taking steps to renegotiate or cancel any agreement that fails to protect American interests. Here are just some of our great achievements from the first 100 days. And I will tell you, in addition to that, we have built such a strong foundations with the leaders of foreign countries, and we are set to rock. But we have great relationships with Germany and Japan and China and so many others The U.K. -- such great relationships. That is part of the process.
We have appointed and confirmed a brand-new justice of the United States Supreme Court. [Applause] Justice Neil Gorsuch, who will uphold the constitution and the right of Americans to govern their own affairs, and the last time a new Supreme Court Justice was confirmed in the first 100 days was 136 years ago in 1881, and I was devastated to hear that because I thought I would be the only one to have done that. [Applause] It was a long time ago.
To protect our jobs and economic freedom, I immediately withdrew the United States from the horrible, disastrous, would have been another NAFTA, but worse, Trans-Pacific Partnership. [Applause] That would have taken your jobs in Pennsylvania, that I can tell you. That was a total hoax. The TPP what have been a tremendous disaster for our country, and we are not going to surrender Pennsylvania jobs ever again. We have done that once before. It is not going to happen. [Applause] we have just launched an investigation into foreign steel dumping and aluminum dumping throughout our country.
We are reviewing every single trade deal, and wherever there is sheeting, we would take immediate action, and there will be penalty. [Applause] And we have with us tonight Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, and one of the great, great people on fair trade and good trade, Mr. Peter Navarro. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] And we will renegotiate NAFTA, and if we don't get a good deal and a fair deal for our country -- and I have been saying for a long time we will either renegotiate or terminate -- I announced the other day we were going to terminate, everybody said we would terminate -- two people I like very much, the President of Mexico and Prime Minister of Canada, called up and said, can we negotiate? I said yes, we can renegotiate.
So we will start a renegotiation, and hopefully it will be fair for everybody. And if it is not a fair deal for our country -- because you have to understand, we have been on the wrong side of the NAFTA deal with Canada and Mexico for many, many years. Many decades. We can't allow it to happen. So we are going to renegotiate, and if we can't make a fair deal for companies and workers, we will terminate NAFTA. Ok? [Applause]
Our directives will let brand-new Pennsylvania steel into the spine of America. [Applause] We've ordered billions and billions of dollars in unpaid duties to be collected at the border from countries that break the rules, and that just started. It is going to be a lot coming in. [Applause] We just want fairness, and I followed through on my promise and issued a new government directives to buy American and hire American. [Applause] In just these first few months, we have created 99,000 new construction jobs, 49,000 new manufacturing jobs, and 27,000 new mining jobs. Who are the miners here? Finally we are taking care of our miners. We love our miners.
And we have over 600,000 new jobs. And by the way, the stock market since our election -- [Applause] -- is through the roof. I believe from the point of the election -- isn't it too bad that the Obama administration gets a lot of credit for those few months? But it's all right. [Booing] They get credit with -- get credit for it. We have an all-time record for the biggest increase in the stock market. So I am very happy about that. [Applause] We have removed the shackles on energy exploration imposed by the last administration, lifting the restrictions on the production of oil, shale, and natural gas.
And very importantly for Pennsylvania, we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, and we are putting our coal miners back to work. [Applause] we love our miners. I am also very pleased to say that we have finally cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access piplines. [Applause] 48,000 new jobs. They couldn't get their approvals. We got them their approvals in 24 hours one day. -- 24 hours, one day. I want to tell you, the heads of those two companies didn't know what the hell happened. They said, how did this happen?
They should go to bed and say their prayers. But that is going to be approximately 48,000 jobs. My administration has also scrapped a job killing regulation that was threatening our auto workers. We want more cars made in the USA, and that is going to happen. [Applause] We have created a new rule which requires that for every one new regulation, to old regulations -- two old regulations must be eliminated. And we have signed massive executive orders clearing up the environmental bureaucracy. We are going to have jobs, and you're seeing them already. We have also been very busy on the legislative front, which we have got no credit for, and yet I am signing away.
I have signed 29 new bills, a record not surpassed since the Truman administration. [Applause] This includes 13 resolutions to eliminate intrusive federal regulations, the most ever signed in our history. In keeping our promise to our veterans, I have signed legislation to extend veterans choice, and the head of the veteran's administration is here with us tonight, David Chilton. He did an incredible job. We have increased by 42% the approval for veterans using the Choice program. I have also created an office of accountability at the VA. Our message to federal workers is clear: If you fail our veterans, you will be held accountable. [Applause]
To create accountability across government, I have issued a five-year ban on federal officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service. Good? [Applause] I have got a lot of people in my staff that are not exactly happy with that one, but that is ok. And I have issued a lifetime ban on federal officials becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. [Applause] I have imposed these bans for a simple reason.
It is time to drain the swamp. [Applause] and that is what we are doing in Washington DC. Perhaps in no area have passed governments sold out since the -- sold out special interest in foreign lobbyists than on the issue of immigration. Year after year, you pleaded for Washington to enforce our laws as illegal immigration surged, refugees flooded in, and lacks vetting -- and lax vetting threaten to your safety and security. And don't worry, we are going to have the wall. Don't worry about it. [Applause] ...
Build that wall, built that wall, built that wall.
We have done so well at the border, a lot of people are saying, wow, maybe the President doesn't need the wall. We need the wall to stop the drugs and human trafficking. We need the wall. In just 100 days, we have taken historic steps to secure our border, imposed needed immigration control like you have never seen before -- is that true? And properly screened and vet those seeking admission into our country. They are going to come in because they love our country.
We are not taking them otherwise. We are operating on a very simple principle that our immigration system should put the needs of American workers, American families, American companies, and American citizens first. [Applause] I have appointed a great military general, John Kelly, to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Since my election, we have already achieved an unprecedented 73% reduction in illegal crossing on our southern border. [Applause]
The greatest reduction in the history of our country, and we just started. The world is getting the message. If you try to illegally enter the United States, you will be caught, detained, deported, or put in prison, and it will happen. [Applause] As I campaigned across the nation, I met with the grieving mothers and fathers of children who had been killed, viciously killed, violently killed by a legal immigrants.
And I made them a promise. We will protect American lives. Your family member will not have died in vain. [Applause] Last week, we opened an office to support the victims of immigration crime, called Voice to make sure that no American victim is ever again ignored by their government -- not going to happen anymore.
And many people are now talking, as I just said, and using this tremendous early progress on the border to say we don't need the kind of safety that we really do need, including the wall. We need safety. We need cameras. We need all of the things that we are going to be putting in, and we need the wall. And we will build the wall as sure as you are standing there tonight. We need the wall. [Applause] ...
Build that wall, build that wall, build that wall.
We will build a wall folks don't even worry about it. Go to sleep. Go home, go to sleep, rest assured. That's the final thing we needed. We need it. If the Democrat knew what the hell they were doing, they would approve it so easy because we want to stop crime in our country. Obviously, they don't mind illegals coming in. They don't mind drug pouring in. They don't mind MS-13 coming in. We are getting them all out of here. Members of congress who will be voting on border security have a simple choice. They can either vote to help drug cartels and criminal aliens trying to enter the United States, like frankly, the Democrats are doing, or they can vote to help American citizens and American families be safe. That is the choice. Who do you want to represent you? [Applause] Unfortunately, Democrats in congress have no leadership. They are rudderless. Senator Schumer is a bad leader. [Booing] I have known him a long time. He is a bad leader, not a natural leader at all. He worked hard to study leadership. When you have to study leadership, you've got problems. And his policies are hurting innocent Americans and making it easier for drug dealers to enter our country. Schumer is weak on crime and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. [Booing] He is a poor leader -- I've known him a long time -- and he is leading the Democrats to doom. It is sad to see for our country what is happening to the Democratic party. At the heart of my administration's efforts to restore the rule of law has been a nationwide crackdown on criminal gangs, and that means taking the fight to the sanctuary cities that shield these dangerous criminals from removal. [Applause] The last very weak administration allowed thousands and thousands of gang members to cross our borders and enter into our communities, where they reached have it on our citizens -- where they wreaked havoc on our citizens. The bloodthirsty cartel known as MS-13 has infiltrated our schools, threatening innocent children. We have seen the horrible assaults and many killings all along Long Island where I grew up.
We are seeing the vicious spread of transnational gangs into all 50 states and the human suffering they bring with them. I have been with the parents. It is devastation. A very respected general recently told me that MS-13 are the equivalent in their meanness to Al-Qaeda. [Booing] My administration will not rest until we have dismantled these violent gangs, and we are doing it rapidly, and we are sending them the hell out of our country.
We are sending them back home where they belong. [Applause] One by one, we are finding the illegal immigrant drug dealers come again members and killers and removing them from our country. Once they are gone, you see what we are doing. They will not let them back in. They are not coming back. [Applause]
In this effort to restore safety to our country, we are going to strongly support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause] I just signed an executive order directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to combat crimes of violence against our police and the Department of Justice is now prioritizing the prosecution of criminals who attack officers of the law.
And we are also working around the clock to keep our nation safe from terrorism. My administration has taken historic steps to improve screening and vetting for those seeking visas to enter the United States. We have seen the attack from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino. We have seen the bloodshed overseas. You look at what is happening in other countries. We already have enough problems to worry about in the United States, which we love so much.
We don't need to be admitting people who want to oppress press, hurt or kill innocent Americans. They are not come again. -- coming in. So let me state this as clearly as I possibly can. We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [Applause, Chanting] So I have a question for you. You have been to a lot of rallies, you have seen a lot of rallies. Is there any place like a Trump rally? [Applause]
So I did this a little bit during the rally. Haven't done it in a long time. Who has heard the poem called the snake? Does anybody wants to hear it again? Are you sure? [Applause] Ok. So let's dedicate this to General Kelly, the border patrol, and the ICE ages for doing such an incredible job. [Applause] This was written by Al Wilson, a long time ago. I thought of it having to do with our borders. We know they're going to have. We're going to have problems. We have to be smart, we have to be vigilant. So, here it is, the snake. It is called "The Snake."
On our way to work one morning, down the path along the lake a tenderhearted woman saw a poor have frozen snake, his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. Poor thing, she cried out, I will take you in, and I will take care of you. The border. Take me in, oh tender woman take me in for heaven sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake.
She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night, and as soon as she arrived she found that pretty snake she taken in had been revived. Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in, for heaven sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake. She clutched him to her bosom. You're so beautiful, she cried, but if I had not brought you in by now, by heavens you would have died.
She stroked his pretty skin again, and kissed him and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite! Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in, sighed the vicious snake. I have saved you, cried the woman and you bit me, heavens why? You know your bite is poisonous, and now I am going to die. Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin. You new damn well I was a snake before you took me in [Applause].
Does that explain it, folks? Keeping America safe also means rebuilding our defenses. Under the leadership of General Mad Dog Mattis -- and he is doing great. By the way, he is the man who recommended General Kelly. I said mad dog, you have to give me a good general for the border. We have begun the process of rebuilding our military and restoring full readiness. We are also protecting taxpayer dollars. I have already saved more than $725 million on a simple order of F-35 planes.
I got involved in the negotiation. And there is billions of dollars to be saved. On that and many other things. We have also stepped up the fight against ISIS and we will not stop until ISIS has been destroyed. [Applause] At the same time, we have strength and our friendships and alliances all around the world. We were very proud to quietly work with the Egyptian government last week to ensure that an American citizen, a beautiful young woman named ?Aya?? came home after being in an Egyptian prison, for the past three years. [Applause]
She was going to be there for another 28 years. President Obama worked diligently for three years, did not get 'em out. I met with President el-Sisi and it worked out quickly. And he was great. And he was great about it. And not only did the court system in Egypt and president el-Sisi let her out, but they let out her husband and they let out a total of eight people that were innocent, and they are all back here right now. [Applause] Now they won't include that in the 100 days, but I am proud to have done it.
She is a happy young woman, believe me. I said how tough was it in that prison? She said you don't want to know. We are also getting NATO countries to finally step up and contribute their fair share. They have begun to increase the contribution by billions of dollars. We are not going to be satisfied until everyone pays what they owe. I have been complaining about that for a long time. And it's a lot different now, but they still a lot of money
America's average military and defense spending was double what all other NATO countries spent combined. Not fair. As we work to get other countries to pay their fair share abroad, we will continue our rebuilding at home. We are rebuilding everything, including our great military. We will have the finest military that we have ever had at any time in the history of our country. [Applause] Last week, my economics team outlined one of the biggest tax cuts in American history. Even bigger than that of Ronald Reagan. We are proposing major tax relief for the middle class and lowering the business tax from 35% all the way down to 15%. [Applause]
You will see companies expand, companies come back into our country. Companies not leave our country anymore because taxes and regulations are so onerous. You will see what happens. Let me also be clear in saying that we are going to save Americans health care and repeal and replace that disaster known as Obamacare, which is dying, dying, dying. [Applause] Obamacare is dead anyway. You know they always like to compare -- Obamacare is dead. It is gone.
The increases were massive last year and they will be bigger this year. Insurance companies are fleeing. One of the top insurers says Obamacare is in a death spiral, there is nothing they can do. They can't compare something to it because it won't be there very long. It is not working. Under Obamacare, we have seen double and triple digit hikes in premiums. Many Americans left with only a single insurer to choose from. Now many of those insurers are fleeing also. You have many like the great state of Tennessee where half of the state already has no insurance carrier. And many others. Obamacare is a catastrophe created exclusively by the Democrats in Congress. And they know it is no good.
And, by the way, we're going to get something great. We're going to get premiums down, deductibles way down. We are going to take care of every single need you are going to to have taken care of. It will not cost that kind of money. We will bring it down. You're going to see it. Premiums down. We will repeal and replace Obamacare. You watch. [Applause] We are going to give Americans the freedom to purchase the health care plans they want, not the health care forced on them by the government. And I will be so angry at Congressman Kelly and Congressman Marino and all of our Congressmen in this room if we don't get this damn thing passed quickly. [Applause]
They will get it done. We know them, they will get it done. In all things, we are returning power to the people where it belongs. We are going to defend the second amendment. [Applause] And your rights to keep and bear arms. We're going to bring education local, and we're going to end common core. [Applause] We are going to stop federal overreach and defend the God-given rights of every American family.
Just imagine what we can accomplish if we all started working together to rebuild this nation, the nation that we so dearly love. Our jobs will come back home, are dying factories will come roaring back to life. It will be a beautiful thing to watch. This is what is going to happen in the United States of America. And it is going to happen soon. And it is actually already happening. Cities small and large will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.
America's children will be taught to love the country and take pride in our great American flag. [Applause] And other countries, you seee that happening, will finally treat America and our citizens with the respect that our country and our citizens deserve. The time for all of us to remember that we are one people with one great American destiny. And that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. [Applause]
And we all share the same glorious freedoms of our magnificent country. We are all made by the same almighty God. [Applause] As long as we remember these truths, we will not fail. We are American, and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. So with hope in our souls and patriotism in our hearts, I say these words to you tonight on 100 days of devotion, hard work and love for our great country.
Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America prosper again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And he will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.
God bless Texas and God bless President Donald Trump We're living in extraordinary times. Today is the first day of early voting in Texas and there's a fundamental choice -- a fundamental choice -- for our state. Do we continue on the road to prosperity, or do we turn back to Obama's stagnation? Do we defend freedom or do we give in to tyranny?
Do we embrace jobs, or do we give in to mob? And here in Texas, the United States Senate race provides the clearest contrast of any race in the country in 2018. We've had a couple of debates with as clear a distinction, as anyone can hope for On every issue, on taxes, I'm proud to have worked hand-in-hand with President Trump to pass the biggest tax cut in a generation.
We cut taxes on small businesses, on job creators, on farmers and ranchers and on working families throughout the state of Texas. Beto O'Rourke wants higher taxes, Beto voted against the tax cut. He voted repeatedly in favor of higher property taxes. And in El Paso, he even voted for something called a rain tax. I don't even know what that is, but here in Texas we celebrate when it rains, we don't tax you for it.
On regulations, I'm proud to have more hand in hand with President Trump to repeal job killing regulations that were hammering the state of Texas Beto O'Rourke Supports higher regulations, hammering oil and gas, hammering the state of Texas. In fact, Beto O'Rourke voted in favor of a $10 a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in the state.
It's now known as a terrific vote. If you want to raise money in San Francisco, But that is a terrible vote. If you care about jobs in the great state of Texas, Because there are millions of jobs in the state of Texas that depend on a vibrant oil and gas industry and energy industry booming in a state of The culmination of the tax cut and cutting job killing regulations, The economy in Texas is booming.
We are right now today producing 33 percent more oil than we did in 2016. We have the lowest unemployment nationally in 49 years. We have the lowest African-American unemployment that has ever been recorded. We have the lowest Hispanic unemployment that has ever been recorded. We have the lowest Asian-American unemployment is ever bad recorded and young people.
We got a whole lot of young people here tonight. We have the lowest youth unemployment in 50 years. And, let me say, look across the Toyota Center, where we're used to seeing the Rockets win, and by the way, they're going all the way this year. This is Houston. This is Texas. This is the diversity of our city and state that we want jobs.
We want freedom, we want opportunity and we're delivering on it. We're getting there. We're getting there, And the Second Amendment is [Inaudible]. In fact, Beto tweeted out to the world how proud he is to have an F rating from the NRA, Not A-, not a D, and I promptly tweeted him. Elections are about choices.
If you want big government, grab a liberal. Well, the Democrats are giving you one on Israel. Today, the United States embassy in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, President Trump, made the bold, courageous, the right decision to move the embassy. I was proud to be in Jerusalem for the opening of the embassy on the 17th anniversary of the creation of the modern State of Israel.
O'Rourke has the most anti-Israel record of any Democratic Senate nominee in the country. Let me give you specifics. In 2014, when Hamas was raining rockets down on Israel, Beto was one of eight eight members of the House of Representatives to vote against funding Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system.
Virtually every Republican voted yes, virtually every Democrat voted yes. Nancy Pelosi voted yes. Maxine Waters voted yes. Beto voted no. I would stand with the people of Israel. On judges. I'm proud to have helped lead the effort to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh.
Every one of us who cares about the Constitution, who cares about the Bill of Rights, who cares about free speech and religious liberty and the Second Amendment and the 10th Amendment right for the federal government to leave us the hell alone. Those judges matter and for the record, I am not Spartacus, But you can be sure if it had been in the Senate, he'd have put on the tollgates on Spartacus circus -- That's not Texas.
On immigration, There is no race in the country with a starker divide on immigration than this US Senate race. Here in the state of Texas, on my part, I am honored to have the formal endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council, the union of the men and women who risk their lives, keeping the border safe and protecting our country. Beto O'Rourke not only opposes the wall, but he says we have too many border walls and fences already. We need to tear down the border walls, We already have.
He supports sanctuary cities, and he said he is, quote, open to -- these are his words -- open to abolishing ICE. That is radical. That is reckless, and that is not the state of Texas. Not only this, O'Rourke is the only Democratic Senate nominee in the country to come out explicitly for impeaching President Donald Trump.
He said he would vote right now today to impeach President Trump in this state is running to the left of Elizabeth Warren, to the left of Bernie Sanders, and the state of Texas is not going to stand for it. In Texas, we support enforcement. In Texas, we support our veterans. In Texas, we stand for the national anthem, the way you do for who we are.
I'm going to make a prediction to each and every person here. In 2020 Donald Trump will be overwhelmingly re-elected as president of the United States, I'm honored that President Trump is here endorsing and supporting my campaign, and I look forward to campaigning alongside him in 2020 for his re-election as President of the United States.
I have the honor to give to you the 45th President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.
Do we have a great country or what? Great country. Hello, Houston. I'm thrilled to be back. Well, you treated me very well during a certain election two years ago. With all my friends from the Lone Star State, a special, special place, thank you very much for being here. This is some record crowd. And they just told me we broke the record, but we could really break it if we could get all the people that are outside in here.
We'd break it by three times. But it's true what they say: Everything in Texas is just bigger. Right? It's bigger. In just 15 days, the people of Texas are going to re-elect a man who has become a really good friend of mine. You know, we had our little difficulties, right? But actually, if you remember, the beginning, it was a love-fest.
And they kept saying, the fake news back here, they kept saying... Remember they kept saying, well, when is it going to break up? And it's day, don't worry, it'll break up. We actually had a rally in Washington, D.C., together. And nobody could believe it. They said, what's going on? What are you doing? But we had the rally together.
And then we said, you know, it's time. That's what has to happen. And it got nasty. And then it ended. And I'll tell you what, nobody has helped me more with your tax cuts, with your regulation, with all of the things that we're doing, including military and our vets, then Senator Ted Cruz. Nobody. He defended your jobs.
He defended your borders. And we are defending that border, by the way, in case you haven't noticed. We are defending that border. He defends your families. He defends your faith. And we are defending together, with a lot of other great Republicans, your freedom. Now, early voting is now underway. So get out there and vote.
It is underway as we speak. If you'd like to leave now, go ahead. Anybody want to leave, go vote, come back. Get behind about 50,000 people outside. Who we love. And we put big screens out for them. Let's wave to them. Wave! But I will say, you got a better location. Your location's better. And Ted is leading the Congress in Congress for more tax cuts.
In fact, I just left Kevin Brady. By the way, how good is Kevin Brady? He's here. We're going to be putting in a 10 percent tax cut for middle-income families. It's going to be put in next week, 10 percent tax cut. Kevin Brady is working on it. We've been working on it for a few months, a 10 percent brand-new -- and that is in addition to the big tax cuts that you've already gotten.
But this one is for middle income. This is -- no business. Business is now good. They're coming back. The jobs are coming back. The plants and factories are coming back like never before. They're all coming back. This is for middle-income people, all middle-income people, a big tax, 10 percent. We'll be putting it in next week.
Now, if the Democrats take over -- I can't speak, I'm sorry. Instead of a tax cut, you're going to have a big, beautiful tax raise. You don't want that. You know, explain that to me. They're for open borders, which means crime, and for massive tax cuts. They're against law enforcement, they're totally against ICE and law enforcement.
They're against your military, and they're not good to your vets. How do you win on that platform? No, how do you win? So we're doing again -- we've done the biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country. And I'm only here for almost two years, actually quite a bit less than two years, if you think about it. We have another three months.
And we've already done more tax cuts -- and we have already done -- biggest tax cut, but we've done more regulation cuts than any other president in history, and that's four years, eight years, 12 years. And what we're doing -- we want people to come into our country. We have a 3.7 percent unemployment. It's the lowest it's been in more than 50 years.
But they have to come in legally, and they have to come in through merit. Through merit. [Audience Chants Build the wall] That's happening. We need it. So we started the wall. They've got $1.6 billion. We got another $1.6 billion. We have a third $1.6 billion. I want to do it fast. And, you know, what's happening right now, as a large group of people -- they call it a caravan.
Do you know how the caravan started? Does everybody know what this means? I think the Democrats had something to do with it. And now they're saying, I think we made a big mistake. Because people are seeing how bad it is, how pathetic it is, how bad our laws are, they made a big mistake. So as the caravan -- and, look, that is an assault on our country.
That's an assault. And in that caravan you have some very bad people. You have some very bad people. And we can't let that happen to our country. And it's not. And I was just talking to your great governor and senators and you were talking about your attorney general, who I'm going to be introducing in a second.
But I'm talking to a lot of your people, and they're going to form a wall, a different kind of wall, until we get the other one built. We need a wall built fast. Fast. We have to protect our borders. We don't have borders, we don't have a country. We have to protect our borders. And Ted, you probably saw, did a beautiful job in staring down an angry left-wing mob in our recent Supreme Court battle victory.
Whatever you want to call it. He was great. And thanks to Ted, and our other great Republicans, because we had no help from the other side, as you know, we now have a brand-new member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And also, this is such an honor, because, you know, you've had many presidents.
They never get to put a justice on the Supreme Court. They've been there for a long time. Think of this. This is the story of our lives. I've been there less than two years, and I have two of them, because we also have... a fantastic new justice in Neil Gorsuch. We had him just approved. He was just confirmed.
And we have a record number of circuit court judges for the time that we've been in office. And that we fully expect to go to the all-time record. And percentagewise, it's right up there, and we've only been here a short -- OK, ready? Here's the question. Percentagewise, who has more justices, federal judges appointed, percentwise than any other president?
Who is it? No, more. Who -- who appointed the highest percentage of judges? No, no, no, it wasn't Hillary Clinton. No, she didn't make it, remember? She didn't make it. No, you know who it is? You'll never guess. It's called George Washington. And we're after George Washington. So a very big thing. No, George Washington, why?
Because he just started. He did 100 percent. Nobody's ever going to break that record. Nobody's ever going to break the record of George Washington. Good, old George. He never told a lie. That's what they say. George Washington, right? He never told a lie. But he did 100 percent of the judges. We'll never beat that record.
But we're getting close. What the radical Democrats did to Justice Kavanaugh and his beautiful family... is a national disgrace. They were on a ruthless mission to obstruct, resist, delay, demolish, and destroy, which is all they know how to do. The fact is, they're lousy politicians, they have horrible policy, but they stick together.
That's one good thing, they stick together. The only thing they have. They always stick together. Other than that, doesn't work out. Other than that, they're not doing too well. If you want the fake news media to finally investigate... By the way, by the way... [Audience Chants CNN Sucks] Don't worry. I don't like them either, OK? But look at this.
Look. Just look. So here we are, we're doing a rally for Ted, and it's great, we have a lot of people. Look how many made it. This is like -- it's like -- this is the Academy Awards, which actually has gone down the tubes. I think we do much better. Look how many. Look how many. Look at them. Do you recognize many of those happy faces back there?
I know every one of them. I know every one of them. And 15 percent of them are great. [Laughter] Every one. I know every one. But if you the fake news to finally investigate Hillary Clinton, we'll just have... Man. [Audience Chants Lock her up] I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. So if you want them to investigate, we'll just have to nominate Hillary Clinton to the United States Supreme Court.
How do you like that? Right? Let's see how she does. If Judge Kavanaugh had to go through what he went through -- and there is -- he's a fine man -- can you imagine Hillary up there? That would take three to four years of questions. [Laughter] At stake in this election is whether we continue the extraordinary prosperity that we've all achieved or whether we let the radical Democrat mob take a giant wrecking ball and destroy our country and our economy.
The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in more than 50 years. Five-oh. Here's one that's hard to beat, because the number of Americans working at this moment -- think of it -- at this -- working, working, working -- the number of Americans working has just reached the highest in the history of our country.
All-time high. We have eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. That's one of the reasons our companies are all coming back. Republicans passed the biggest tax cut and reform in history with massive tax cuts for the middle class. And now we're adding 10 percent to those numbers. We've saved your family farms, ranches, and small businesses from the estate tax, also known as the death tax.
So most of you love your children. Some of you don't. [Laughter] But the ones who don't, don't listen to me, because this won't matter, because you're not going to leave it anyway. And if you don't love your children, and if your children didn't treat you good, don't leave them anything. [Laughter] Give it to charity or somebody else.
But for those of you that really would like your small businesses, your farms, your ranches left to your children instead of now having your children go out when you kick the bucket, a sad day, and about two or three days later, they're happy as hell. No, forget it. [Laughter] Instead of have them -- instead on having them go out and borrow a tremendous amount of money to pay the estate tax, they don't have to borrow anything.
There's no tax. There's no tax. So you'll be able to -- to me, that's a very important thing. Nobody even talks about it. That was in our -- that was in our tax cuts. So a lot of small business, a lot of farms, ranches, and there will be no tax. So that's great for your children. Only if you love them. Only if you love them.
Anybody in here does not love their child? Anybody? [Audience member calls out] A couple of you. Two people. That's not bad. My administration also ended the horrible war on American energy, something you people know a lot about. He withdrew the United States from the very unfair, one-sided Paris climate accord, which was putting us out of business.
On day one, I approved the Keystone and the Dakota Access pipeline, 48,000 jobs, day one. Day one. Think of that, day one. They spent years and years trying to get these pipelines built. And by the way, we're speeding up the approval process by a factor of 10 for your pipelines that you desperately need in Texas to get the oil to its destination.
We're speeding it up. I've heard so much. With Texas leading the way, think of this one, the United States is now -- this happened over the last very short period of time -- the largest producer of crude oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. Thank you. That's pretty good. That's big stuff. We're the number-one energy producer in the world.
Who would think that? And we're going to get those pipelines approved very rapidly. I called the heads of agencies. I say, get them approved. And, you know what, if there's a problem, we let them know about the problem immediately. We don't take them 20 years down the road and then say we can't approve it. We let them know immediately.
There won't be a problem. For the first time in more than 60 years, America is a net exporter of natural gas. And here's good news for Texas. Good news for Texas. Because just today, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced that her country will now purchase massive amounts of LNG, which is great news for your state.
And I told all of the European nations, it's not fair. We have all these horrible trade imbalances. They take such advantage. They're not taking advantage anymore, folks. Under Republican leadership, America is winning again, America is respected again, because we are putting America first.
We're putting America first. It hasn't happened in a lot of decades. We're putting them first. We're taking care of ourselves for a change, folks. Thank you. I like that guy, but not that much. Not that much.
But radical Democrats want to turn back the clock for the rule of corrupt power-hungry globalists. You know what a globalist is, right? You know what a globalist is? A globalist is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring about our country so much. And you know what? We can't have that. You know, they have a word. It sort of became old-fashioned. It's called a nationalist. And I say, really, we're not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, OK? I'm a nationalist. Nationalist. Nothing -- use that word. Use that word. [Audience Chants USA]
They reported yesterday that Donald Trump is very unpopular with foreign nations. He's one of the most unpopular presidents in the history of polling. And I said -- no, I said, of course I'm unpopular with foreign nations, because we're not letting them rip us off anymore, folks, OK? They meant it to be bad.
When the fake news -- they meant it to be bad. Donald Trump, very unpopular with other nations. And you know what I had? It was 70 percent against and 30 percent for. I said, who is the 30 percent? Why would they ever want to vote for him? Because, honestly, we're treating everybody good. We're helping people.
We're protecting people. But, you know, when we protect with our military, the greatest in the world, and now it's a lot better than it's ever been because of what we're doing... We have to be reimbursed for that protection. We have to be reimbursed. We're protecting the wealthiest nations in the world. And we're subsidizing them.
And then they beat us on trade. They take advantage of us. So those days are over. You're seeing it, it's happening fast. Happening fast. The most unpopular president. Think of that. Most unpopular president. But I'm one of the most popular presidents in this country, and that's good. That's just good. In our country.
A couple of polls came out today that were very good. And they didn't want to put them on. They didn't want to announce them. And they paid for the polls. We have a new poll out. Let me see. Oh, let's get to another subject. Fake news. The Democrats want to replace freedom with socialism. They want to replace Texas values with Nancy Pelosi values.
And they want to replace the rule of law with the rule of the mob. That's what is happening. And the Democrats would rather destroy American communities than defend America's borders. Not going to let it happen. Got to vote for Ted Cruz. Democrats -- the Democrats are a big risk to the American family, and our country cannot afford to take those kind of risks.
We can't. This will be the election of the caravan, Kavanaugh, law and order, tax cuts, and common sense. That's what it is, common sense. Ted's opponent in this race is a stone-cold phony named Robert Francis O'Rourke, sometimes referred to as Beto. And he pretends to be a moderate, but he's actually a radical open-borders left-winger.
That's what he is. And I know Texas well. Don't forget, they tried to convince you on Election Night that Texas is in play. I kept hearing -- I'd go to a thing, and I'd have -- remember the lines I'd have for the speeches? Would have lines like it is tonight. I hate to tell you, I think the lines are bigger tonight than they were two years -- you know why?
Because I produced. I produced. Because I produced. No, the lines are bigger tonight. And it's easier. You know, two years ago, two-and-a-half years ago, I'd have to get up and say, we will give you tax cuts, we will cut regulations. But it was all words. Now I've produced, so this is easy. This is easy.
In fact, some of those guys -- and they don't question it -- will say that I produced more than I promised, which is true. Which is true, actually. But O'Rourke voted against your tax cuts and he went against Texas oil workers with the job-killing regulations and taxes that were really, really hurting those jobs and those companies.
O'Rourke supports a socialist takeover of health care. You're going to triple your taxes and it won't be enough. And it will be lousy health care. You'll end up waiting for five weeks to see a doctor. And I heard Ted say just before I went on, but to me this is a beauty, because I don't know of anybody that's earned this rating.
He got an F from the NRA, one of the few. You know -- you know what an F means? An F means he wants to take away your guns, OK? That's what it means. I never even heard of an F. I never heard. Louie, did you ever hear of an F? I never heard. Do we love Louie? Do we love Louie? Look at him. Louie Gohmert.
I don't know what Louie's rating is, but I would assume it's about, what, an A-plus, right? A-plus-plus. Louie. I love people that are gutsy -- they have guts. He has guts. It's up there. They defend you. And they defend your Second Amendment. And if Ted doesn't win, your Second Amendment is going to be in trouble.
Big trouble. Remember that. O'Rourke voted against the border wall, oh, that's a good thing to -- he voted against Kate's law. And he voted for Obama amnesty, amnesty, Obama amnesty. O'Rourke even voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation. He doesn't want to deport them. He says they're people.
They're people. They carve you up with a knife, but they're people. O'Rourke voted in favor of sanctuary cities that result in the death of countless Americans. Today's Democrat Party would rather protect criminal aliens than American citizens, which is why the Democrats must be voted out of office. We need more Republican votes.
A vote for a Democrat this November is a vote to surrender Congress to Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer, the great Maxine Waters, that's a beauty. Maxine Waters. Did you get that one? You get that? Maxine. She's going to be in charge of your finances. Maxine. Good old Maxine. Low IQ individual. [Laughter] Low IQ. How about this one?
Senator Dianne Feinstein. The mayor who did one of the worst jobs of any mayor, other than the guy running for governor in Florida. He was a horrible mayor, too. Cory Booker. He destroyed what he did. He was so bad running Newark. And a sad thing happened last week. Because Elizabeth Warren was exposed as being a total fraud.
And I can no longer call her Pocahontas, because she has no Indian blood! I can't call her... I can't call her Pocahontas. She doesn't qualify. She has -- I've been saying for a long time. I've been saying it for a year-and-a-half, I said I have more Indian blood than she has, and I have none. I have none.
But I have more than she has. But I can't use the name Pocahontas anymore. But if you don't mind, I will anyway. Is that OK? We got to keep her down. But in this election, the people of Texas are going to make a giant and beautiful stand. You're going to elect a Republican House. And even they're having a little problem.
They're getting a little nervous, right? Remember, about a month ago, right, they were talking about this blue wave. Oh. You don't hear about the blue wave. You're not hearing so much. The blue wave is being dissipated a little bit. I don't hear them talking -- are you guys still talking about the blue wave?
The blue wave, that's coming, right? Blue wave. You don't hear about it too much. Let me tell you, you got to get out and vote. Because you know what happens? The party that has the presidency -- I don't know why. I guess you get a little sedate, I guess you get a little something. Who knows? You lose something.
I don't know. But I think two times since the Great Depression, it was a positive. But nobody ever had the condition of having produced the greatest economy in the history of our country, right? Nobody. So I don't understand, why would we lose the House? But historically -- so history is against us, but the facts are all with us. So I think we're going to do well.
You have to get out and vote. Early voting, remember. But I think we're going to do great with the House and we're going to do fantastic with the Senate so that we can keep making America great again. And, you know, we're going to be changing. I love that -- I hate to -- OK, let me ask your advice, right?
Texas, you're smart, you're tough. So we have make America great again. I think it has to be the greatest slogan in the history of politics, right? Make America great again. What did she have? Some stupid slogan like stay together. [Laughter] Remember -- and then when I knocked it -- or wasn't it like stay with me? And then I got up, and I said, see, that's all she can talk about is herself.
So they paid a million dollars for that slogan and she changed it the next morning because it was a disaster. Stay with me. They didn't do that. They decided not to. So here's what happened. Make America great again. But now we're running -- we're doing good. We've come so -- you know, we've created $11.7 trillion.
And, remember, we're hitting China hard. We're hitting everybody hard. We're doing these trade deals. So we're doing this. When they all kick in, you'll see numbers like you wouldn't believe. But we've created $11.7 trillion. Other countries, China, you've never seen this before with China. Remember, it was always China's doing so great, China, China, everything's China.
I said, what about us? Well, we're down. We're not down anymore, folks! We're way up. Way up. We're way up. Way up. [Audience Chants USA] And, by the way, I want China to do well, but they went down 32 percent over the last six months and we went way up. And since our election, we've gone up almost 50 percent.
Think of it, $11.7 trillion we created. China has lost about $20 trillion. We want them to be happy, we want them to do well, but they have to treat us fairly. They haven't treated us fairly. And they will. They have a wonderful, great leader, President Xi, and they will. The choice in November could not be more clear.
Democrats produce mobs. Republicans produce jobs. Right? [Audience Chants Trump] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. It's a great state. These are great people. And did we ever help you -- hey, did, honestly, you know we were here a lot. Did we help you with that lousy hurricane that you suffered through?
That sucker was brutal. That was brutal. I never saw anything like it. It kept coming in. It was taunting us. Have you ever been taunted? It was taunting. It would come in and you'd say, oh, great, now it's -- then it goes out, it reloads, it comes in. Then it dumps. Then it goes out. Then it comes -- three times.
And I'm paying for that. I'm saying, is this thing ever going to stop? Will it just go away? That was a brutal -- that was a brutal hurricane. And you know who was fantastic? The United States Coast Guard. You know, because that was a very big deal, and there was a lot of water. And I don't know who in this room did it, but these guys with the little boats, they think they have this great boat, OK? Where do these people come from?
They want to go out and they want to go into the hurricane to show their wife how great they are? And then they get out and they say, oh, my god, I'm dead. And I asked one of the Coast Guard guys, I said, so let me ask you a question. When they go out -- by the way, the Coast Guard, hard to believe, they saved in Texas more than any other place.
Florida had a bad one, but it wasn't the same kind. In Texas, the United States Coast Guard saved 16,000 lives. Think of what that is. Think of what that is. And I said to a couple of the top guys -- these are great people. I said, let me ask you a question. When these boats, what happens? He said, well, they want to go out, they want to sort of play at the edge.
But there was no edge to this big monster. And it gobbled them up. And these guys are going through it. I said, how big is a thing like that? You have great equipment, you have the greatest boats. They said, sir, we have the best boats in the world, but we hit that thing wrong, we don't have a chance. These are great boats.
He said, we go down just like everybody else. And they would ride the crest. They call it ride the crest. They'd back up. They'd let it go by. They'd come in. They'd save a lot of people. They'd go back out. Then it came back out. The Coast Guard, their brand has appreciated more than any brand in this country, the United States Coast Guard.
We have to say it. They did a great job. And next time, all you guys and gals, when there's a hurricane, do me a favor. Don't take your boat out. Just get out of town for a little while. That was a brutal period of time. But you did incredibly. And you really -- FEMA was great. Law enforcement was great.
First responders were great. The military. But the Coast Guard represented the military. Incredible. So we were honored to be joined this evening by many great Republican leaders. Here tonight is a man who is incredible. He is a man with tremendous spirit. He asked me for more money than any human being has ever asked for.
I got to tell you -- first, his name happens to be Governor Greg Abbott. Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Where is Greg? Where is he? He's the greatest guy. Where is he? I think he's -- there are a lot of people in this room. But, you know, Greg, I just took pictures with him backstage. I think -- do we like him more than Trump?
Yes, right? No, yes, I do. I like him more than Trump. But he called me up. And we have just given billions and billions of dollars to the state of Texas. And he goes, Mr. President, could I ask you one small question? "What?" He said, sir, we'd like to build a dam, and it's not very much money, but it would really help us for the next hurricane.
It would keep the waters out of Houston. You know where he's talking about right? And he said it was just a small favor, but if I could, I'd like to ask you for that money. I said, Greg, how much is it? This -- how many -- $35 billion, $40 billion? I said, Greg, how much is it? Sir, it's only $10 billion.
I said, wait a minute. Say it again. It's only -- listen to this -- it's only $10 billion with a B. I said, Greg, that's the most expensive dam I've ever heard of. But I'll tell you, he loves Texas. He's here some place. He loves Texas. He loves Texas. He loves the people of Texas. And he's a great man. And he did a fantastic job under a lot of pressure.
That hurricane was pressure. And you got all A's and A-pluses. Everybody did, the responders, FEMA, the governor, and the lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick. Dan? Finally, I see them. They're over here. It's hard, when you have 22,000 people in a room, it's hard to fire one person. It's hard to find one person even when he's tall.
And another tall guy, who is an incredible senator, he represents you so well. He's always fighting for you. And he was the one that asked Dianne Feinstein, did you leak? Remember? And she went, oh. So he was the one. He said, looks over to her, remember? During the hearings? Those horrible hearings, where they were so nasty and horrible, to a great gentleman who's going to go down as one of our greatest Supreme Court justices ever?
He goes out and he goes -- he's on the committee. And he goes, did you leak? And she went, oh, what, no, no, no, I don't -- wait a minute, let me check. Did we leak? No, you -- no, we didn't leak. Oh. No. That was the worst body language. She was so guilty of leaking. She leaked. John Cornyn was great. He was great during the hearings.
Stand up, John. You know, it was a surprise. You surprised her, right? She didn't know what the hell happened, John. You surprised her with that beautiful Texas accent. Thank you, John. Great job. Always a great job, not just there. Always a great job. And you have an attorney general who doesn't stop. He's tough, he's smart, he collects more money for this state.
He loves the state. Ken Paxton, thank you, Ken. Great job. Doing a great job, Ken. We're working closely with your state leaders in the recovery effort following the devastation of Harvey. We continue to work. It doesn't go so quickly, although in this case went very fast. And we're never going to rest until that hurricane is totally out of our sight, our vision, everything's fixed, and it's very close to being finalized.
But we'll never rest until every last brick, every piece of asphalt and concrete, everything is perfecto. Right? And if we did rest, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn and Ken Paxton and Dan -- I love Dan, what a great guy, thank you -- they will not let me rest, will you? They'll never let me rest. We stand ready to help Texas respond to the storms that are continuing to cause flooding throughout the region.
And we're doing things to alleviate some of those storms. I don't know that we're going to do the one that the governor asked for, but that could be. That could. I said, would you name it the "Trump Dam," please? Name it the "Trump Dam." It's beautiful, it's big and expensive. I want -- no, I'm only kidding.
I did not ask him that. Tomorrow would be headline, Trump demands name on the dam. I also want to recognize your outstanding Republican Congressman, including Chairman Kevin Brady, what a guy. Where is he? What a guy. You talk about help with taxes. And so, Kevin, we're putting in next week the 10 percent reduction in middle-income taxes, right, next week?
OK. He promised in front of 22,000 people. I don't need that. He promised to me. That's good. Thank you, Kevin. What a great job. Great man. Congressman Bill Flores, thank you, Bill. Great job. Congressman John Conner. Get out and vote for Bill and John. A friend of mine, you don't have to vote for him, actually, because he's so far ahead -- I'm sure he loves me saying this -- you don't have to vote for him.
Just -- all these other -- got to vote for them. Can't take -- but you don't have to vote for this guy. He is leading by, like, 60 points. He's leading by -- but, you know what, do me a favor. Because I don't want to have a depressed man on my shoulders. Go out and vote for him anyway, because he is outstanding.
He's a winner. He's a champion. He's a warrior. Louie Gohmert. Louie. Hey, Louie, should they bother voting or is it just over? You want them to vote, right, Louie? I think we'll have -- go out and vote for Louie. Another congressman who's been so helpful, Ted Poe. Ted, thank you, Poe. Congressman Pete Olson.
Thank you, Pete. Great job. Congressman Randy Weber. Thank you. Great job, Randy. Thank you, Randy. You got great people in this state, by the way. These are great people. Congressman Brian Babin. Congressman John Culberson, who's a great guy. He's a great guy. Get out and vote for John. He's got a lot of money being poured against him.
Get out and vote for John. Get out and vote for Pete Sessions. Pete Sessions is a fantastic congressman. They're pouring money in that race. He's still leading, and John's leading, but get out. Louie, don't worry. John, Pete, you have to. Jodey Arrington, Jodey? Jodey has done a great job. And Congressman Michael Cloud, thank you, Michael.
Thank you, Michael. Great job, Michael. Great job. These are great people. Great patriots, people that love Texas. If you don't want to be saying the words Speaker Nancy Pelosi... that's not good -- for the next two years, then you need to go out and vote for these tremendous Republican lawmakers. They are tremendous.
Thank you, fellas. Thank you. Thank you, fellas. Thank you, Louie. Thank you, Louie. This election is about protecting the sacred values we all share and the values that Texas Republicans are fighting for each and every day. We believe in the right to free speech, the right to religious liberty, and we believe in the right to keep and bear arms.
We believe in law and order, and we cherish the incredible men and women of law enforcement. We believe that judges should always interpret the Constitution as written. We believe that schools should teach our children to be proud of their country and to respect our great American flag. We kneel in prayer and we proudly stand for our national anthem and our American flag.
We know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true center of American life. So true. And above all else, we know this. In America, we don't worship government. We worship God. These are the values that unite people all across the great state of Texas. In this election, you can send a message to the radical Democrats, don't mess with Texas.
Vote for Ted Cruz and vote Republican. A future under Democratic mob rule would be a total catastrophe. Democrats in Congress have already signed up for a socialist takeover of health care that would eliminate the private insurance of more than 15 million Texans. The Democrat plan would destroy Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage for 1.4 million Texas seniors who depend on it. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and who have paid for it for a long time.
And Republicans will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We protect you. Pre-existing conditions. Right? The Democrat plan to destroy American health care includes free health care and education to illegal aliens paid for by you, thank you very much, the American taxpayer. And they absolutely demand -- and that's happening -- they want to demand to vote.
They want to be able to vote. They want to be able to vote. Oh, don't worry about it. They want to be able to vote. The illegals -- and by the way, I hate to tell you, you go to California, you go -- they vote anyway. They vote anyway. And they're not supposed to. And every time I say it, the fake news says, oh, they said -- they got so many people voting legally in this country, it's a disgrace, OK? It's a disgrace.
Voter ID, folks. Voter ID. Voter ID. You got to put your voter ID -- you do it on everything. The only thing you don't have to do it for is when you vote. Not going to be that way. Voter ID. Republicans believe we should protect public benefits for truly needy Americans, not for illegal aliens. As we speak, the Democrat Party is openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and overwhelm our nation.
That's what's happening. The Democrats have launched an assault on the sovereignty of our country, the security of our nation, and the safety of every single American. The crisis on our border right now as we speak is the sole result of Democrat laws and activists, Democrat judges that prevent us from returning illegal aliens from Central America and all over the world.
It's called catch and release. You know what catch and release is, right? You got these great people from Border Patrol. These are great people, ICE, Border Patrol. These are incredible people. Tough job. They catch them and then they release them. And they say you have to come back for a court case. They just put their foot over immediately.
They touch our land. You have to come back in two years for a court case. Well, number one, they never come back. Three percent. And I don't believe the three. We release them into our country, because that's what the Democrats want. And then a lot of bad things happen when that happens. The Democrats don't care what their extremist immigration agenda will do to your neighborhoods, to your hospitals, or to your schools.
They don't care that the mass illegal immigration will totally bankrupt our country, because all the Democrats care about is regaining power, no matter how they have to go about doing it. All the witch hunts, no matter what they do, they just want to gain power. But we're not going to let them gain power.
And that's why the Democrats all support catch and release. That's why they support visa lottery. You know what visa lottery? Countries put name in a batch and you pick them. You pick them. You keep picking them. And then then you got nothing but problems, because you think those countries are putting their finest?
I don't think so. It's a great way to dispose of their problems. Visa lottery. And then you have chain migration. A guy comes in, as an example, West Side Highway in Manhattan. That's where I am. Beautiful park, beautiful highway. This animal is driving a car down and he decides he's going to make a right, right into the park where everyone is working out, exercising, running, bicycling.
And he knocks everything down, including kills eight people. And badly wounds -- you ever notice they never talk about the people that are wounded, where they lose their arms, and their legs, and their lives can never be the same? They never talk. They say eight people died. They don't talk about the 12 people that lost something so important.
These are people that are in a park where they go to exercise so they can be in perfect shape. And they go home months later without their legs, without their arms. Because this animal going at a very fast speed just decided he's going to make a right into the park and run people over. So he has 22 people that came in, because he's here.
So he's here. It's called chain, a chain, nice name, chain migration. He's here. His mother comes with him, his father then comes, his uncle, his aunt, his brother, his nephew, his sister, 22 people. No jobs. Just 22 people. No more chain migration. No more chain migration. That's why the Democrats want to give illegal aliens free welfare and the right to vote.
That's why Democrats want to abolish ICE. The casualties of the Democrats' open border crusade -- and you're going to see it over the next two weeks -- I'm stuck with it. I want to change it. But we have a tiny, tiny majority. I need the votes. We don't have enough votes. As an example, with the Senate, we need 60 votes.
But we have 51. We have a tiny majority. We need 60 votes. So they don't allow us to do it. They're killing and hurting innocent Americans. Democrat immigration policies allow poisonous drugs and MS-13 to pour into our country. And Democrat sanctuary cities release violent criminals from jail and straight into your neighborhoods.
Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. Common sense. Common sense. The Republican Party will always stand proudly with the heroes of ICE. These are tough people, by the way. They're great Americans, but you don't want their job. They go into the -- they call them nests, MS-13, killers.
They don't like using guns because it's too quick. They like cutting people up, slicing them, killing them, like they did to two beautiful, lovely young girls going back home from school, killing them, slicing them. They didn't want the guns. These are evil people. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right.
He said it. These are -- that's right. They're animals. They're animals. So, you know, when I see -- in Long Island, I grew up in -- near Long Island, and I know every town out there. These are great towns. They have been great towns. For some reason, a lot of the MS-13 went out to Long Island. And I've been hearing from friends of mine.
And we send ICE in. We put ICE in there and it's like you liberate -- it's like a war. You liberate the town. And those people are clapping and screaming. And these guys in ICE, they walk right into those nests, and they're tougher and smarter than MS-13. And MS-13 respects them, because none of you guys want that job.
I don't want that job. Maybe Louie Gohmert will take it. I don't know. But I don't want that job. I don't want that job. But, no, seriously, these are heroes. And they go in and they take them and they throw them into the paddy wagon, then get them the hell out of our country. We've removed thousands, thousands of them.
They came in through the wonderful Obama administration. We removed thousands and thousands of these people. And the towns are liberated. And you see the people, they're clapping from their window. I'm telling you, it's like a war. It's like a war zone. These are great towns, great places, but ICE -- we have to cherish ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement.
And, yeah, and we're getting the wall finished, because it's a very important element of what we need. Even the Democrats are seeing it. I got a call today, I said, you know, we really do need the wall. When he sees those people pouring up, you've got to have a wall. If you want to secure our borders, support our law enforcement, and stop catch-and-release and all of the other things I just spoke about, go out and vote Republican.
Do it now or do it on November 6th. If you want America to endure as a sovereign, independent nation, go out and vote Republican. And if you want high-paying jobs, rising wages, and a booming economy, then go out and vote Republican. In less than two years' time, we have created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps.
They said that was impossible. We've added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. Remember the previous administration? I won't be specific, but let's say the head of the previous administration -- does anybody know who I'm talking about? Remember he said, you can't have manufacturing jobs in this country. You'd need a magic wand, remember the famous -- well, I guess we found the magic wand.
The best jobs there are. The best jobs there are. And manufacturing confidence just today hit an all-time high in the history of our country. Economic growth last quarter reached 4.2 percent. Remember, 4.1 percent, then elevated to 4.2 percent. They said that wouldn't happen for years. And we have another great one coming up. And we have an interest rate climate.
We don't have a climate where you had zero interest rates. Give me zero interest rates for a little while, you want to see numbers. But we're being conservative. Hispanic American median household income -- Hispanic Americans -- think of it -- median income reached an all-time high. Hispanic American poverty has reached an all-time low.
And Hispanic American homeownership recently hit its highest rate in much more than a decade. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment has reached the lowest level ever recorded in our country's history. And women's unemployment just fell to 3.6 percent, the lowest rate in 65 years.
Earlier this month, I announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal with an incredible brand-new US-Mexico-Canada agreement, the USMCA. And that's a great deal. Our farmers are happy. Our manufacturers are happy. You're not going to have companies leaving for other countries. Very important part of the deal.
I said, I don't want our companies moving to other countries, firing all their people, making the product, and then putting it in with no tax and selling it back to our people. Not going to happen. That deal totally takes care of it. Not going to happen. No more. No more. We lost 35 percent of our automobile business in a short period of time.
NAFTA was a disaster. That's why I refuse -- they wanted to call it NAFTA II. I said, I don't want the name NAFTA. It's so shaded with what we did. It's a great deal. Bob Lighthizer, so many people worked so hard on that. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices.
We've also made a deal with South Korea, the new trade deal, it's a great deal for our farmers, our manufacturers, everybody. We've taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. Americans should not be forced to subsidize lower drug prices in foreign countries while paying the highest drug prices ever in the history of this world.
We've gone through the process. It's a statutory process. I'm very soon finished with it. Drug prices will soon be plunging. Watch. Secretary Azar, great job. To help critically ill patients get life-saving treatments, we just passed right to try. Do you know what that is? That's a person who's very sick, they're terminally ill, they want hope.
They want to be able and get something. We have the greatest -- the greatest medical people in the world by far. We have the greatest things -- they're looking. They're under research. And what happened is people would be told they're terminally ill. They have a big problem. And if we had a drug or we had treatment that gave great hope, that looked promising, we couldn't even come close to letting them use it. And for 44 years, they've been trying to get this done, where if somebody is really sick, terminally ill, and we have something in the pipeline that looks really good.
We got to let them use it, and that's called right to try, because I know people, they traveled all over the world looking for -- looking for hope. They were looking for hope. And now they sign a simple document and they go out and they get it. And by the way, this we signed three months ago. We have had tremendous results already.
And, you know, one of the other things, John, because John was very much involved and Ted, one of the things it really is, it's the ultimate test if you think about it. It's the ultimate test. But it was very hard to get approved. We got it approved. It's done, right to try. I hope nobody has to use it. I hope nobody has to use it, OK? Stay away.
But you know what, if you're really sick and they have something in the pipeline, that's good. You never had a chance. Now you get it, very routinely. And we obtained $6 billion to fight the opioid epidemic, which is a big problem. And with Ted, I'll tell you, he was incredible. With Ted's help, we repealed the core of Obamacare, the individual mandate penalty that everybody hated.
And it's gone. Everybody hated it. And we passed Veterans Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor, instead of waiting on line for one month, two months, three months, four months. And having a simple illness corrected, you'd have people that stand in line so long they would have a simple problem, and by the time they got to see a doctor, they were terminally ill.
Terminally ill. So now they have to wait on line. These are our great people. If our veterans have to wait online, they go out and they see a private doctor. We pay the bill. And we get them fixed up. And we also passed for the veterans the V.A. accountability law to ensure that anyone who mistreats our veterans will be accountable.
In other words, Jim, get out of here. You're fired. Get out. You couldn't fire these people. You couldn't get them out. They could be sadists. They could be thieves. They could do whatever they wanted to do. You couldn't fire them. And for our military, we secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military.
And we are getting other countries to pay up and pay their fair share for our military protection, including NATO, where I asked to recover billions and billions of dollars. In just two years, I've asked NATO, you've got to pay up. We're protecting -- you got to pay. They weren't paying. Close to $100 billion a year, we got it. That they pay.
We don't pay. They pay. We're protecting them. We're protecting them. And that's great, but they got to pay. At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force. So important. So important. I'm telling you, right, John? Cornyn will get that through.
See the way people love it. It's so important. It's where it's at. It's really where it's at. To keep America safe from terrorism, we have put in place the travel ban. Remember that? Recently upheld by the United States Supreme Court. Remember that? You'll never get it approved, Mr. President. Let's give it a shot.
We just had it approved by the United States Supreme Court. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Together, we have made extraordinary progress, but we are just getting started.
If you vote to elect a Republican House and a Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, raise your incomes, help your jobs, take care of your medical problems. We will protect Medicare and Social Security. The Democrats will never be able to do it. We will defend the Second Amendment, and we will continue to confirm great judges who will abide by our laws and our Constitution.
We will fully secure our border. We will pass Kate's law. We will stop sanctuary cities. We will stop visa lottery. We will end chain migration. And we will keep the criminal drug dealers, predators, and terrorists the hell out of our country. We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.
For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America. They apologized. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the great state of Texas. But to continue this incredible momentum, to protect your state and your country, you need to elect a Republican House and a Republican Senate.
And you need to vote for Ted Cruz. He's a terrific, great senator. Loyal citizens like you helped to build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people. That's what happened. That was the greatest movement in the history of our country, what's happened.
Look at this as an example. A president would come to Texas and if they had 300 or 400 people in a conference room in a hotel, it would be considered a success. We had over 100,000 people want to come here today. Over a hundred. The greatest movement in the history of our country. And it's your movement much more that it's my movement.
I'm just laying it out. I'm telling it like it is. From Houston to Austin, from Dallas to El Paso, from the Red River to the Rio Grande, this state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk the face of the Earth. This is the state where William Travis, James Bowie, and Davy Crockett made their last stand at the Alamo.
This is the state where a small band of patriots at the Battle of Gonzales, armed with a single cannon, stared down a foreign army and declared, "Come and take it." Come and take it, they said. Come and take it. Come on up. Come on up and take it. Come on. Oh, what happened? You didn't want to take it? And Texas is the state where generations of farmers and ranchers and oil workers and pioneers built a life and a home with their own two hands.
They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. These courageous Texas patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud American heritage.
For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, and win, and going to keep on winning. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. And we will never back down. We will never surrender.
And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are American, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Texas. Thank you.
Wow, thank you so much. Hello, West Virginia. What a place. You know, we only won West Virginia by 42 points last time. 42 points. You know what that is? That's like -- did anyone ever hear of 42 points -- and we're going to better this time, OK? But I'm thrilled to be back in this great state. I love this state with thousands of hard working American patriots.
And what job numbers we had today. Did you hear? Did you hear? We're going to that. They all say speak about the economy. Speak about the economy. Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country... but sometimes it's not as exciting to talk about the economy, right? Because we have a lot of other things to talk about.
Also, very important, the economy I unbelievable. You know it better than anybody because your state under our great Governor Big Jim Justice wherever he may be. Where is he? Where's big Jim? He's around here someplace. One thing you can't miss him. There he is. You can't miss him. He's got to be 6'11 and he's up there in the weight, but I won't get into it. He's the greatest.
But I'm going to introduce him in a second. But we're here to celebrate our amazing achievements together, to make America's incredible comeback continuing and we will. Right now we're moving full speed ahead like nobody thought was possible. They did not think it was possible. They did not think it. In just four days -- so important.
Because you have a great candidate. You have a couple of great candidates. Carol is a great candidate also. You know that. Carol Miller. In just four days the people of West Virginia are going to send Carol Miller to the House and Patrick Morrisey to the Senate so we making America great again. This election will decide whether we build on the extraordinary prosperity that we've unleashed.
Nobody can believe what's happened. Or whether we let the radical Democrats take control of Congress and take a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to our future. America now has the best economy in the history of our country, and we want to keep it that way. In last month alone we added -- this just came out a few hours ago -- 250,000 jobs.
That's in the month of October, by the way. That's for one month. And nearly half a million Americans returned to the workforce. We've created 4.5 million new jobs since the election, a number that was unthinkable. If I would have said that during the campaign, oh they would have given me a hard time. They would have said Pinocchio, you know, they do the whole thing.
Oh boy. And we've lifted 4.3 million Americans off of food stamps. The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years. More Americans are working today -- think of this -- than ever before. More American today, right now, this hour, are working than ever before in the history of our country.
How good is that? How do you lose that debate? When we're debating a lefty, how do you lose the debate when they're looking at you and say well, we're going to look at jobs. But more Americans in the history of our country. I mean that to me is -- here's another one. African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans unemployment have all reached the lowest levels in the history of our country.
How do you lose that in a debate? How do you lose that in a debate? It's always nice. You know, when you go into a debate it is nice to have the facts on your side. It's going to be very tough to beat. Wages are rising and you know it's -- it's been incredible. And it just got announced they're going at the fastest pace in much more than a decade and wages went up. First time in a long time.
They haven't gone up. People were making more money 19 years ago. I used to talk about it during the campaign. Where people had single jobs and they were making more money than they had with two and three jobs today. And now for the first time wages are going up, and they're going up nicely, and people have a choice of lots of different jobs.
And right here in West Virginia jobless claims reached the lowest level in the history of your state. Is that good? No wonder I won by 42 points. No wonder. But then it was just talk. Remember? When I came, I was campaigning. What did you know? I mean, it was another, "Can you believe politicians?" I'm a politician.
I guess. I have to say. Am I a politician? But I said things. And we overperformed, let's put it that way. We overperformed. And West Virginia's very happy, and that coal is coming back and our miners are working again, folks. They're working again. After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country.
And as you know very well, because you look at your wallet, Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal and we're putting our coal miners back to work. That you know better than anybody.
Remember when my opponent in the last race went to another state about four weeks before she got to West Virginia? And she was bragging, how she was going to put the coal miners out of work? Remember that? Remember that? And I said, "You know? I don't think this is going to play well in four weeks." She was in a non-coal state, talking about how she was going to put the coal business out of business.
That didn't work. It's doing great. And countries are buying our coal, and Asia now, you see what's happening? Asia's buying massive amounts. And you're back in business, folks. You're back in business. You wouldn't have been in business for another 12 months. You were going to be out of business in 12 months.
You couldn't have -- you couldn't have sustained it. I'm telling you, the timing was perfect. Don't ever wait that long. You were ready. You were ready to go over the cliff. That wasn't good. But you're back in business. Your miners are back. And last year, our coal export skyrocketed by 65 percent. Pretty amazing.
Under Republican leadership, America is booming. America is thriving. And America is winning. Winning like never before, because we are finally putting America first. It's been a long time. But if Chuck Schumer -- cryin' Chuck -- and Nancy Pelosi... and the legendary Maxine Waters... take power, they will try to erase our gains and eradicate our progress.
That's what's going to happen. They're going to work hard, and we will be fighting. Oh, it will be -- it will be ridiculous, frankly. It'll be bad for our country. The Democrats -- and it could happen. Could happen. We're doing very well, and we're doing really well in the Senate. But it could happen. And you know what you do? My whole life.
You know what I say? Don't worry about it, I'll just figure it out. Does that make sense? I'll just figure it out. The Democrats want to raise your taxes, restore job-killing regulations, shut down your coal mines -- and, by the way, they will shut down your coal mines. You know that. That's one thing I can guarantee.
We can talk about taxes, and I'll be here, veto, veto, veto. But they ultimately want to raise your taxes very substantially. But I can tell you, they will shut down your coal mines. They want to take away your good health care, and essentially use socialism to turn America into Venezuela and Democrats want to totally open the borders.
They have the caravans, let them in. Do you want to let them in? Does anybody want to let them in?
I don't get it. Think of it -- you campaign on open borders and higher taxes. How the hell do you win that -- how do you win?
You're right. Thank you, and we started the wall and built 1.6 billion and we have another 1.6 billion and then get another 1.6 billion. I want to build it all at one time, but wait till -- wait till you see -- go home and see tonight what our great military is doing on the border. Wait till you see. Go home and enjoy it. So the Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan and I don't know if you know -- you see the big caravan coming in? Three more are forming and you know what we give to these countries?
Hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras and to El Salvador, right? We have -- to others we give hundreds of millions of dollars. Do you know what they to give? Nothing -- nothing. They give us nothing. They give us nothing. That's going to be stopping, that's going to be stopping. But caravan after caravan is forming unvetted, illegal aliens trying to flood into our country on your dollar, over whelming your schools, depleting your resources, and endangering your community.
Homeland Security has just confirmed that members of the lawless caravan, the one you've been watching, come from 20 different countries and influet among them criminals and gang members convicted of crimes ranging from armed robbery to sexual assault. And I don't know if you saw the one -- they interviewed him yesterday and he was asking for pardon.
Didn't speak English and the nice young -- I guess reporter was saying oh, (inaudible) and what was it for? And essentially it was for murder who wants -- and he's in the caravan. This is what we have -- and you look -- you look at him, you look like nice, no, no murder, right? You saw that, good I hope you saw that.
And then they gave me a hard time because I put it up on Twitter and they gave me a hard time. They said you shouldn't be doing that, that's not nice. And I say, all I'm doing is just telling the trust, what can I say. Republicans want strong borders, no drugs, no gangs, and no caravans. The choice in this election could not be more simple, a Republican Congress means more jobs and less crime.
A Democrat Congress means more crime and less jobs. That's pretty good, that's nice and simple, doesn't get simpler than that. So this Tuesday you have to go out -- I know in West Virginia you tend to vote on Tuesday more so than I guess you could do the early thing, but everyone here likes to go out -- me too.
There's something nice about its called Election Day. We're all old fashioned. That's why we get along. That's why we get along, but you have to go out on Tuesday and vote. And I'll tell you, Patrick's going to be fantastic. And you know what, he'll always vote for us. Not for me, for us. He'll always -- he's not going to be voting with Schumer or Pelosi and open borders and all the things that they want.
And we're honored to be joined by a friend of mine who I just mentioned before because he is one great gentlemen. You know, he's a very, very successful man before he did this and he did it, and he made a mistake. He ran as a Democrat. And he didn't like it, and now he's a happy man and the Republican Party loves him.
Big Jim Justice, your governor. Where is Jim? Thank you, Jim. Big Jim, you're doing a great job -- stay there, Jim. Just relax. Just relax. Just relax, but I'll tell you what, are you enjoying being governor, Jim? The people love you. 65 percent up, coal exports, 65 and he works on it hard. Thank you, Jim for being here.
Thanks for your support. We love -- we love our governor. Thank you, Jim. And another great friend of mine, somebody that has always been there, just always been there. And she is a fighter. She is very strong, tough but a great woman. He says Melania, that's true also. That's true, because surely I could say Melania too.
Because she's been great. Great first lady, I will say that. And if you think it's easy being a first lady and married to me, it's not that easy. She's fantastic. But Senator Shelley Moore Capito, she was -- where is Shelley? Thanks, Shelley. Great job. Really a fantastic job, I appreciate it. Always there for us, always wanting to vote for West Virginia.
Also joining us is Tim Armstead, who is running as you know for Supreme Court. A man who is highly respected and I just want to put a little word out, he's going for that extension. You know what an extension is, I guess you do a good job, you're supposed to be extended. And he has done so, Tim, wherever you may be -- where's Tim?
Good luck, Tim. Good luck, Tim. Thank you. OK? And Jim specifically said you mind doing that, he's a good man, right? He is a good man. Thank you, good luck. Do you have any opposition -- any strong opposition? It's not strong, it's opposition but not strong. Nobody's going to beat you, Tim. Not after this anyway.
Thank you, Tim. But I'm especially proud to introduce the next person who has really become (inaudible). And he's just -- he is a bundle of energy. He doesn't stop. You know, he's tied right now. They're tied in the polls, it's very close. It's very close. And I have to say, I like Joe. The problem is I'm just not going to get Joe's vote.
I'm just not going to get it. I like him; he's a friend of mine. I'm just not going to get his vote. Even with Justice Kavanaugh, you know, I called Joe. I said, "Joe, do me a favor. I'd like you to vote." He said, "well, I may. I may." But no, but you got to vote before I win, not after we have the vote because it was a real question because nobody has ever been treated worse that Judge Brett Kavanaugh at the time now Justice Kavanaugh.
Nobody, nobody. Get got blindsided like nobody ever got blindsided. What happened to him is disgraceful and what the Democrats did and the way they played that way a disgrace, right? A disgrace. And Joe said, "I'll think about it. I'll think about it." I said, "Joe, I don't want you to vote after we get the votes," because I didn't know we were going to have the votes without any Democrats.
We didn't get one Democratic vote, so I said, "Joe, I need the vote like today." This was a few days before the vote. "Well, let me think about it. Let me think about it. I want to wait to do it." OK, because there's nobody smoother than Joe, you understand. There's nobody smoother than Joe. And, no. He's much smoother than Schumer actually.
Crying Chuck, right, right? When he wants something, he cries. But I've never seen him cry before, then he cried. But Joe said, "all right, let me think about it. Let me think about it." And then it came time to vote, and as you know we got the vote. And when that final vote was just coming out, Joe waited about one-tenth of one second.
Now it means that Justice Kavanaugh was going to be Justice Kavanaugh, right? We had all the votes, so we didn't need Joe's vote. And he pressed that button. I think it was about one-eighth of one second after we had the final vote from Susan Collins, who did us a good job, good job. She did a good job. Really did.
And it was really a tough period of time, but Joe -- I said, "Joe, that doesn't count." It doesn't count because if we would have needed the vote it was not going to happen. Does that make any sense? Do you guys understand that? I said, "Joe, do it before we have the vote. I think we've got the vote. Do it before we have the vote." And he said, "let me think.
Let me think." And then when I spoke to him later he tried to say, "but I was watching for that one-eighth of a second. I was watching." But he didn't do it. He didn't do it. And I'll tell you what. Patrick Morrisey, I built up your coal business and it's going to get a lot better by the way. A lot. As much as you're doing and as good as you're doing, if you look at what's happening, if you look at other countries wanting our coal -- and I'll tell you, which buys a lot of coal from West Virginia.
Do you know that? Vietnam -- I was with the Prime Minister and the president. You know, when you're with -- well, like when you're the President of the United States -I went to Vietnam, I went to various places in Asia -- but where you're the president here, you're not greeted by a president. You're greeted by a president and the Prime Minister.
They have both. And they said they buy their coal now, because of me, from West Virginia. Well, that's good. But I -- something I didn't know -- I learned a lot since then. That was six months ago -- they said it is -- they've used coal for a long time. They said it's the finest coal in the world. It's the finest coal in the world.
They have a lot of options, but they said it's the finest coal. I said, "good, if I'm never like around the people, which I expect to be a lot, I will explain that." But you -- do you understand? Do the miners know what I'm saying what I say that? The finest -- see, somebody like me coming from 5th Avenue.
What the hell do I know about that? All I know is I want to put my miners back to work. And I know it works. And I know -- and I know for national security reasons -- another reason -- coal is something we have to have. We have to have. But they said it's the finest coal in the world. I thought that was great.
Might as well tell you. Now I've told you and I don't feel guilty any longer. But I just want to introduce your next United States senator from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey. Patrick, come on up.
Wow. Isn't this president making West Virginia great again? Thank you, Mr. President, for coming back again. I have to tell you, last night I had a debate with Senator Joe Manchin. And you know what he said? He attacked -- he attacked me for supporting President Trump. Well I will never apologize for defending President Trump, nor will I kneel to alter of Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi. I ask for your vote today.
President Trump needs a staunch ally in the U.S. Senate. I will be that ally. But I need your vote. I need your help. Go online. patrickmorrisey.com, volunteer, donate, help me defeat the Manchin Schumer ATM machine. Mr. President, thank you for everything you've done for West Virginia. You've been huge in our state and I look forward to winning and working with this president. Thank you and god bless.
What a good job that was. So I said how's Patrick Morrisey doing to some of my friends, two people that live here, they -- I said how's he doing. They said he is the Energizer bunny. He is all over the state. You know, sometimes you'll ask that question about candidates -- I won't mention names -- and how're they doing -- oh, they're lazy, they're not working.
They're not working. Well they couldn't say that about me in 2016 because (inaudible). Even these people say he's got a lot of energy. This man has a lot of energy. And just finally on Joe, I have to say that he was all for Hillary Clinton. He was for Hillary Clinton. She was against coal, she was against the miners, she got no support in this state, and yet Joe was totally in her camp.
So that sort of -- that sort of tells you -- you know, Patrick -- as your attorney general, Patrick -- [Audience chants Lock her up] That's up to Patrick and he won't do that. Because he's just focused on one thing, becoming your next United States senator. That's what he's doing. But Patrick's been tough on crime and a fierce defender of the rule of law.
And as your senator, he'll always be the tireless champion for the great people of this great state. He loves this state. And your vote on election day -- thank you very much. He's not my type, but I like him anyway, folks. He's a rough looking guy. But you're going to decide. And -- and everybody's watching West Virginia.
Because you know, this was a race -- when it started I won by a lot. And -- and a lot of people said that this was not one that was going to happen. This was a while ago, and then Patrick came along and did unbelievably in the primary. He has won statewide a number of times so he's been -- he's been through it but he's won statewide.
He knows your state as well as anybody I guess and a lot of people said well, I don't know. It's almost -- lets sort of focus on other states, which were also doing very well I have to say. And then all the sudden we see polls and it's tied -- it's in one case he's up a little bit, another case he's down a little bit but I mean its right there.
Let's assume it's sided. It's going to be whoever gets the people going to the polls on Tuesday. The whole country is watching the great state of West Virginia. It's going to be a very exciting moment. They asked me -- the fake news media asks me recently, like a couple of days it will say, what race are you watching?
Oh I'm watching Florida, I'm watching all of the red, but I said watch West Virginia. It's going to be very inter -- and they said what? I said watch West Virginia, the great place. So you're going to decide, maybe, which party controls the United States Senate. It's a very powerful love and a vote for Joe is a vote for Schumer.
It's a vote for a majority leader who will be not good and we don't want to put anti coal -- these are anti coal people. We are -- they are anti coal people and they vote anti coal and frankly, that's what you're getting and if that's what you end up with it's your vote, not mine. Remember that, remember that.
Joe will never be with us in terms of the vote, he'll be with us in a lot of ways. We'll go to dinner with him, we'll take him out, we like him but he's never going to vote for it so I just want you to remember that, ok? Ok, let's get on with it. Let's get on with it, let's get on with it. Patrick, I think if he ever voted against us I'll come back here, I'll say we're going to impeach him -- impeach, we will impeach Patrick.
He'll never do it. He loves the people too much. He loves your industry too much. He understands the state too well. It's not going to happen. So if you don't want the Democrat mob like you saw in the Senate, vote for Patrick. Just vote for him. Finally, we're thrilled to be joined by the next member of Congress, a person who you really do like a lot I have to say, and she's doing well and I thought I'd just call her up for a second.
Third district in West Virginia, Carol Miller, she's done a fantastic job, Carol.
It is terrific to be up here sharing a stage with our great President. West Virginia loves President Trump. President Trump, thank you for all of the support you have given my campaign. I can't wait to be Congress to work with you.
You can always count on me to put America first, fight for coal, grow our economy, protect Social Security and Medicare, embrace our veterans, and strengthen our borders. Mr. President, thank you so much for your commitment to West Virginia. God bless you and God bless our country.
Thank you, Carol. Be careful. [Audience chats USA] So just to tell you that Carol is great on jobs, she loves our coal miners. You know that. She'll always support our vets. She's very strong on our vets. We love our vets. Our military and our law enforcement. And Carol's opponent is a radical left winger named Richard Ojeda.
If you don't want to be saying the words Speaker Pelosi for the next two years, who will end your coal business, then you better vote for Carol Miller. Thank you, Carol. Thank you. Thank you, Carol. She's doing great. If Democrats gain power, they'll also be planning a takeover of American healthcare and that would be socialism, what they want to do. The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than 121,000 West Virginia seniors who depend on it. Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and by the way, who paid for it. Right?
You paid for it. And Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. We're all doing that. I listened to President Obama speak today. He had a very small crowd. I have to be honest with you. They don't tell you that. You know? They don't tell you that. We had -- in Houston we had the biggest thing you've ever seen and they were saying Donald Trump spoke today in front of a few thousand people.
Few thousand? We had over 100,000 people that wanted to come. We had 22,000 people in the arena. We had thousands and thousands of people outside of the arena. Donald Trump spoke today in front of a crowd of a few thousand people. Can you believe it? It's called the fake news, folks. But I head President Obama speak today.
I had to listen -- I was in the plane; I had nothing else to do. I heard him talk about telling the truth. He was talking about you have to tell the truth. And yet 28 times he said you can keep your doctor if you like your doctor. You can keep your plan if you like your plan. They were all lies. Over and over again you heard that.
Just used it to pass a terrible healthcare plan that we are decimating strike by strike. You saw what happened to the individual mandate, the most unpopular part. And we actually had Obamacare killed except for one Republican vote and any Democrat -- one Democrat and we would have had it obliterated and you would have had great healthcare.
But we're doing a lot to make it a lot better until we do get rid of it. Then I heard him talk about the freedom of the press. We have to maintain the press. We have to love those people. Love. Except that nobody was worse to the President Obama. Nobody. In fact, he even used, as I remember, the Justice Department to go after reporters.
Remember? Remember? When he's talking about how I should be nice to the fake news. No thank you. And let's not forget President Obama's false promises about our trade deals. Just one. His administration promised that with South Korea we would create in a trade deal 70,000 jobs. But instead of that, it killed over 100,000 jobs in our country.
It was a horrible deal, which by the way, I have totally renegotiated and made it a good deal. Lie after lie, broken promise after broken promise, that's what he did. Unlike President Obama, we live by a different moto. It's called promises made, promises kept. And we've done more than we ever said we would.
We said we were going to do things and we've done a lot more and they will be the first to tell you tell. Democrats' plan -- that's right, the magic wand, right? Remember, he said you need a magic wand to produce manufacturing jobs. Well, we just hit almost 600,000. Democrats' plan to destroy healthcare, also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants.
I'm sure you don't mind that. As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to violate our laws and to over run our borders. They want to sign illegal aliens up for free healthcare, free welfare, free education and the right to vote. Otherwise, they don't get much. Illegal immigration cost American tax payers more than $100 billion every single year, more than 20 times the entire state budget of the sate of West Virginia.
We need to use our precious resources to help low income Americans who respect our laws, not caravans who break in to our country and break our laws. We don't want that. We don't want that, I'm sorry. Now, we don't mind if they come in, but they have to come in legally. Democrat immigration policies not only drain our treasury, but they threaten our communities.
Nearly 100 percent of heroin in the United States enters though the southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, the majority of meth and a substantial portion of the ultra lethal fentanyl killing a youth drug, fentanyl -- the worst. These drugs kill more than 70,000 Americans every single year.
Last year alone, our brave ICE officers who they want to get rid of by the way, these are tough, great, strong patriots. We need strength, arrested more than 127,000. Think of that, 127,000-- Aliens- With criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes and 1,800 homicides.
They want to get rid of them, let's get rid of ICE. What are these people thinking? That's why you have to have Patrick Morrisey and Carol. You have to vote them in on Tuesday. You have to do it. Yet Democrats want to abolish ICE, they want to turn America in to a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens, drug dealers and MS-13 killers.
And by the way, we remove thousands over the last little bit less than two years that I've been here. Thousands and thousands of MS-13 gang members have been thrown the hell out of the country. A blue wave equals a crime wave -- you don't hear too much about the blue wave anymore though, do you? Remember a couple of months -- oh, the blue wave, oh the blue wave.
Now they don't talk -- you know, I'm not saying they don't squeak it by, maybe because they got of races and I can't go everywhere. Can't go everywhere. But now they're talking about (inaudible). I mean, you know let's see what happens. Going t be an interesting day at the office. You remember that election two years ago?
There were a lot of really happy people that night, but there were some that were slightly -- not too happy. Cry, baby, cry. A red wave equals jobs and safety. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement.
You have great law enforcement right here... in West Virginia. I look at those people -- I'm looking at your law enforcement right there. I feel very safe. Thank you, fellas. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, fellas. And, yes, the wall is happening. It should happen immediately. It's moving beautifully. The design is beautiful, and it's happening.
And some communities in California, of all places, down to miss San Diego, we're just about finishing it up. But they're demanding the wall. They want the wall. I said, "Let's not give it to them because then they'll put pressure on their government to build it," right? Now once we build it for them, they'll say, "We shouldn't have a wall." But they already have their wall.
That's the way it works, folks. Border security is also a woman's issue. You know, they keep talking about women. Trump with women. Remember the last election? "Well, Donald Trump won't do very well with women." I did great with women. Look at the (inaudible). I did great. Right? I did great with women. In fact, at the end, when I won, they -- they said, "You know, a statistic we got wrong, women really came out for Trump." I said, "Thank you.
Thank you." Same thing now. Because women want safe neighborhoods for their families, right? They want great schools, health care for their children. They want to keep drug dealers and predators and traffickers -- how about the traffickers? These are human traffickers. These are the worst scum in the world.
They want them out of our country. And we do that. The Democrats don't do that. They want the open borders. Fly right in, folks. Come on in. We don't care who the hell you are, come on in. Think of it, 300 people. You know, we're getting a lot of heat because, I was saying, there were some bad people in that caravan.
Right? So we checked, 300 people. I read them out to you. That is one more reason why women all across the nation are going to show up and vote Republican on Tuesday. They want security. They want safety. They don't want to have these people coming in. They don't want to have -- some of these people are just horrible people.
You have to see the crimes they've committed. This election is about security, and it's about prosperity. For years, you watched as we let foreign countries plunder our wealth and shutter our factories and steal our jobs. And you watched helplessly. We don't watch helplessly any more. Those days are over.
We've added half a million manufacturing jobs -- soon to be 600,000 -- since the election, including 32,000 in just the last month.
These were jobs that the previous administration said would never happen. And these are great jobs. These are among our greatest jobs. Manufacturing jobs. And thanks to our tariffs that we put on steel that was coming in, and they were dumping it all over the place and destroying our steel companies and our aluminum industry.
Roaring back. Steel industry is roaring back. And for the miners, by the way, in Minnesota and other places, we're grabbing that iron ore and they're making steel. And the hottest industry -- one of the hottest industries now, look at what's happened to steel. Steel, like coal, it was going off the cliff.
You weren't going to have a steel industry in this country and we need it. Certain industries you need, you need steel. You don't have steel -- you need it for defense. What are we going to go incase we're -- hopefully we'll never have a problem, ok. I made the military -- it'll be stronger than it ever was before ever and that's why you won't have a problem.
You know, if you don't want to have a problem, make your military much stronger than anybody else ever thought possible, but we need steel. How about this? We don't have any -- so see our steel bills were finished. We were going down -- you guys understand that, but we were going down. Now it's so hot, but you need steel.
There are certain industries you have to have -- you need defense. You don't have it -- you have purpose, what are we gonna do? We have a conflict and we call China? We need more steel. Please, please, could we have some more steel? It's ridiculous. Our steel industry is roaring back and we're putting billions of dollars in our treasury because we're charging 25 percent tax on those people that dump their steel.
They dump is all over the place in order to destroy our steel industry and the miner are coming back, in this case, since the iron ore and it's coming out and it's gonna -- it's a beautiful thing to see. I mean we've rebuilt -- we really started that about eight months ago, really heavy started it. I wanted to get my feet a little bit wet as President, right.
We started it about eight months ago. It's incredible. The head of U.S. Steel called up, he said I've never said anything like it -- what you've been able to do in such a short period of time. They're building seven new plants, they're expanding plants. Nucor -- Nucor, a big steel company is building brand new plants $750 million, $900 million brand new plants.
It's incredible. They haven't been built in years. Last month, I announced that we're replacing the horrible NAFTA deal, one of the worst -- stupidest deals ever made with an incredible brand new U.S. Mexico Canada agreement. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices and we're doing very nicely.
We'll probably make a deal. They want to make a deal. America is being respected again. We're respected as a country again. We were not respected for a long time. We were laughed at just like these stupid immigration laws. The whole world looks at it, they laugh, they said what is this all about? A person comes into our country -- another country throws them out.
Hey, get out. You're not supposed to be here, you have to go through a process. You know what we do? We take them -- we can't do anything -- we bring them through a court proceeding. We take a person who walks onto our property we have a big deal -- a court case. They have lawyers, we have lawyers and what happens is then they go away and is supposed to come back for the trial.
Could be two years, three years later and they disappear into the country never to be seen again. There's no trial, very few people come back -- almost none. This is the procedure. This is the law. This is crazy. And the Democrats don't want to change it because they know its chaos and a disaster and they think that's good, but I think it's good for us because I think they overplayed their hand.
And how these caravans were formed, you'll have to figure that out. But they overplayed their hand too, assuming they had something to do with it but it was very well organized, amazingly, in Honduras and the different places very well. And you know they came up and I'll tell you people are really energized.
They're energized about that, they're energized about the way justice, as you know Kavanaugh. Just as Kavanaugh was treated, they're energized when they saw the way he was -- Brett Kavanaugh -- when they saw the way he was treated, they're energized about a lot of things. They want to see us be a great, respected country.
And that's what's happening. We have taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs to help critically ill patients get life saving treatments. We passed something that they've been trying to pass for many, many years. It's called right to try where you can try stuff. That isn't out yet, but it's looking promising.
That's such an important thing. They've been trying to pass that for decades. I got it done. After years of surging premiums, the cost of healthcare is finally coming down. We're getting the cost of healthcare down. And last month, I proudly signed the largest bill to fight the opioid epidemic. It's the largest bill in American history.
We passed Veterans Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor. And the landmark VA accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreat our veterans will be held accountable. You are fired. Get out. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military. And we gave our great warriors, I know you have some of them right here.
And I know they don't care about this, they couldn't care less, they don't mind; maybe we'll take it back. We gave them the largest pay raise they've had in more than a decade. OK? Our military. They deserve it. And my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth ranch of the American armed forces, the Space force.
I was (inaudible) the United States from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. And just today, we riposted all sanctions that were lifted under that horrible deal. Just today. We now have in place the toughest ever sanctions on a corrupt regime in Iran. We've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
Many, many presidents said they were going to do that, they never got it done. I got it done. I even got it built. I already built the embassy. $1 billion under budget, right? One billion. One billion under budget. It was supposed to go as $1.1 billion, we go tit done for less than $500,000. That's not bad, that's -- it's a long story, I won't bother telling you this.
But it's pretty amazing. And there are many things like that. Together, we have made extraordinary progress. And we're just getting started. But the democrats want to turn back the clock and put America in reverse and give power back to corrupt, selfish ruling class people. And they want to take the power back for themselves.
But we are not going backwards, we're going forwards. I need your vote for a republican house. I need your vote for a republican senate. So we can continue this incredible movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country. And I say it all the time. And they can challenge it. Greatest movement in the history of our country.
You know, Bernie Sanders had a reasonably good movement. But Hilary clipped him. Yes, don't look in that one, he got clipped. But we would've beaten him easy. He would've been easier. Crazy Bernie. We will keep on cutting your taxes, reducing your regulations and raising your incomes. We will protect Medicare and your social security.
Remember what I said during the debates? Everyone was talking about cutting the social security and all -- I said we're not touching your social security. We haven't touched it in a long time now.
We will defend your right to free speech, religious liberty and we will continue to confirm judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border, we will pass case law, we stop sanctuary cities, we will stop catch and release, and visa lottery, and chain migration, and we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists the hell out of our country.
We will lift millions of our citizens from Welfare to work. Dependents to independents and poverty to prosperity, that's what's going to happen. For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for American. We're standing up for your values, we're standing up for West Virginia, and we are proudly standing up for our national anthem.
To continue our incredible momentum, I need you to get your family, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and go out and vote Republican for all of them and our two stars right here. On Tuesday, I need the people of West Virginia to send a message to crying Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, and the radical Democrats by voting for Carol Miller and Patrick Morrisey.
Loyal citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country, returning power to you -- the American people like we said we were going to do. This great state was built by some of the toughest men and strongest woman ever to walk the face of the earth. These proud West Virginia patriots braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home with their own two hands.
They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury but they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their country, and they loved their God, right? They loved their God. They loved their God is right. These courageous American's did not shed their blood, sweat and tears, so that we could sit at home will others try to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud American heritage.
For the sake of our freedom and for the sake our children we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender, and we will always fight on to victory, always, always.
Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God and together we will make America wealthy again. Make America strong again. Make American safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, West Virginia. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause]
Thank you everybody. I love this place. You know, we set every record in Alabama. I love Alabama.
It's special, thank you very much. [Audience Chants USA] Well, I am, I'm thrilled to be here with a really great person that I've gotten to know, Luther Strange, and with the hardworking, patriotic citizens of this great state. You have some football games tomorrow, but we're going to have a lot of fun and then you're going to win at football tomorrow. [Applause] I love this state and I love the people of this state.
They've been so good to me. And we are producing, we are really producing. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you.
And on Tuesday, we're going to send a real fighter and a real good guy from Alabama to the United States Senate on a permanent basis. [Applause] And we have another great person in our audience tonight, Richard Shelby. Where is Richard? Where is he? Richard? [Applause] Where's Richard? Thank you, Richard. Stand up so they can see you, Richard.
Fantastic. Thank you, Richard. [Applause] Respected man, I will tell you. He's respected and loved in the Senate.
He's only been there for, what, 34 years or something like that, right? But he loves the people of Alabama, too. And like all of you, Luther Strange knows the true source of America's strength. It's God, it's family and it's country. [Applause] And Luther is going to be taking over for a man that you all love.
What's his name? Senator Jeff Sessions, you love Jeff Sessions and he's doing a good job. [Applause] He is doing a good job. We have him very busy watching the borders. A lot of things are happening.
But Luther is taking over for Jeff hopefully and you are going to be so impressed with what we're going to do in Washington. But before we begin, I want to send our thoughts and prayers to the people of Texas and Louisiana and Florida and Georgia and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and all of the other communities that have recently been ravaged by storms and by floods. [Applause]
And you took such great care of those people, you really did. [Applause] I said, you know, Governor, you're the fastest-growing state anywhere in the world this week. But it was -- you really did, you did a great job. And your governor is doing a great job, too, by the way.
When one part of America hurts, we all hurt. We grieve over all that's been lost, but we're also inspired by the incredible strength and spirit and resilience of our people. Together, we will recover, rebuild and return bigger, better, stronger than ever before. It's going to happen.
It's going to happen quickly, quickly, better. Right? [Applause] We also send our prayers to the people of Mexico. They got hit hard by a devastating earthquake, taken a lot of lives, a lot more than they even thought. And I've spoken with the president of Mexico and we pledged our total support.
We have crews in there right now lifting up that heavy concrete. And it's a rough sight, it's a rough sight. We've got a lot of people we sent down with a lot of big equipment, but that's a tough go. It's a really tough thing to look at and to see and to see the sadness.
But that was bad. I've just come from a very productive week at the United Nations General Assembly. [Applause, Audience Chants USA] Where we've been working with our friends and allies to pursue a future of prosperity and security and peace. And we've got some really good people that I know and have tremendous relationships and we have some really, really bad people and we're going to take care of the bad people.
It's about time. We're going to take care of the bad people. [Applause] It's one of the greatest honors of my life to represent the American people on that world stage. And I will tell you, the world is starting to respect the United States of America again. [Applause]
As I said during my address to the United Nation, I will always defend America's interests above all else. I'm here for you, I'm not here for global interests . We're not here for the rest of the globe. [Applause] And we want to treat the rest of the globe right.
And, you know, when I say America first everyone was saying, gee, and I never liked it from the standpoint that if you're in another country you want your country to be first by the leader, right? So nobody really understood. For years they've said America first, although I'm the one that really means it, there's a big difference. [Applause] And I said, look, it's going to be America first. We're going to renegotiate these trade deals.
We're bringing a lot of people back. We're bringing companies back. You see it in Alabama. You see it in Alabama. [Applause]
But I'm not going to worry so much about other countries. I want to treat them with respect, I want to treat them good and I want their people to fight for them just like I'm going to fight. But we're going to be like your football teams, we're going to win all the time, we're going to win. Believe me. [Applause]
I believe the best path to a more peaceful world are proud, independent and sovereign nations that serve and respect their own people. When you look at what's going on in the world, you have so many where they don't respect their people. But we want nations that cooperate together to create better for all people. That's what we're all about, all people.
And we can't have madmen out there shooting rockets all over the place. [Applause] And by the way, "Rocket Man"" should have been handled a long time ago. [Applause] He should have been handled a long time ago by Clinton. I won't mention the Republicans
Why did this -- you know, this is a different time. This should have been handled eight years ago and four years ago and 15 years ago and 20 years ago and 25 years ago. This shouldn't be handled now. But I'm going to handle it because we have to handle it. [Applause]
Little "Rocket Man."" We're going to do it because we really have no choice. We really have no choice. Now
And I want to tell you something, and I'm sure he's listening because he watches every word. And I guarantee you one thing, he's watching us like he never watched anybody before, that I can tell you, that I can tell you. [Applause] And maybe something gets worked out and maybe it doesn't. Personally, I'm not sure that it will.
Other people like to say, oh, we want peace. You know, they've been saying now for 25 years, oh, we want peace, we want peace. And then he goes and just keeps going, going, going. Well, maybe something gets worked out and maybe it doesn't.
But I can tell you one thing, you are protected, OK? You are protected. Nobody is going to mess with our people. [Applause] Nobody is going to play games. Nobody is going to put our people in that kind of danger.
Nobody. [Applause] And Japan and South Korea are right up there with us. And by the way, many other countries, many, many other countries, they're right up there with us. And I have to tell you, I made a friend in China, President Xi, and yesterday he basically took the banking industry away from North Korea.
Never been done before. [Applause] Never been done. That's based on relationship. Relationship is very good.
But we're dealing with somebody that we'll figure out he may be smart, he may be strategic and he may be totally crazy. But you know what? No matter what he is, we're going to handle it, folks, believe me. We're going to handle it. [Applause] The foundation for progress begins at home with a government that protects and defends our citizens.
And that's what we have to do. That is why I'm here tonight to ask the good people of Alabama to send Luther Strange to the United States Senate so he can defend your interests, fight for your values and always put America first. Go out and get out the vote! [Applause]
But I'm going to tell you, I'll just tell you this quick, crazy story. So why do I like Luther? Because, you know, I have a lot of friends and some of them called, do you mind if I go for the other candidate? I said really you can, I mean, some of them are working for me and they feel and that's fine.
Of course, they may not have a job on Monday, but these are my -- right, Richard? We may have to get rid of a few of them. I've already gotten rid of a few of them. But they're good people. No, they're good people.
But I'll tell you what happened. The first go around on health care, I said, you know, for seven years we've been hearing repeal and replace Obamacare, right? For seven years I've been hearing repeal and replace. So I'm very much involved. You know, they like to say, well, Mr.
Trump, President Trump sat in the Oval Office and didn't -- I'm on the phone screaming at people all day long for weeks. They gave me a list of 10 people that were absolute noes. These are 10 Republican senators. Now, John McCain's list... [Booing]
John McCain was not on the list, so that was a totally unexpected thing, terrible. Honestly terrible. Repeal and replace because John McCain, if you look at his campaign, his last campaign, was all about repeal and replace, repeal and replace. So he decided to do something different and that's fine.
And I say we still have a chance to -- oh, we're going to do it eventually, we're going to do it eventually. With Luther and everyone we're going to do it. But I have to tell you this story because we're here tonight for Luther Strange. I'm here sort of for two.
I'm here for Luther and I'm actually here, it's a Friday night, I really do love the people of Alabama because you've treated me so good. [Applause] In fact, I said, I don't want to speak negatively, I said, though, that if I lose this election, maybe I'll end up moving to Alabama or Kentucky or, like, some states. [Applause] I mean, nice to go where people love you and where you love them because it's special. So here's what happened.
Here's what happened. But we never want to lose, right, despite that. We don't want to lose because we have a great agenda. And by the way, we're doing a lot of work, we're getting a lot of things done.
They hate to admit it. Including we have a Supreme Court justice, Judge Gorsuch, who will save how about a thing called your Second Amendment, right. OK, remember that? [Applause] If crooked Hillary got elected, you would not have a Second Amendment, believe me. You'd be handing in your rifles.
You'd be saying here, here, here they are. [Booing] You'd be turning over your rifles. You've got to speak to Jeff Sessions about that. [Applause] So here's what happened with Luther.
So Luther, I get this list, 10 names of people that are absolute total noes. And there were good people, a lot of them. By the way, in all fairness, Rand Paul was on that list. They said don't even waste your time calling him.
He voted twice yes, OK? He was very good. And I haven't given up on him because I think he may come around, OK? Wouldn't it be ironic if he took John McCain's place and they definitely do not like each other. Wouldn't that be ironic? That would be very ironic for those of you that know the inner workings of the Senate. So with Luther, so I have a list and one of the names is Luther Strange.
And I know he's the senator from Alabama, but I don't know him, I met him once. I said that is the tallest human being I've ever seen. I'm tall. I'm tall.
I never saw something -- he's, like, he should be on the New York Nicks, they could use him. So that's why I call him "Big Luther
OK. And I'll get a vote or I won't, whatever, but brutal, brutal. You know what that is, folks, right? It's called brutality. I call another one, I say, Senator, we need your vote, I know you're opposed to it, but I -- well, you know, I think I can get there, but you have to do me a favor.
You have to see my brother and his wife, they love you and they want to have dinner with you and they want to have breakfast with you and lunch, then after you're finished with them, how about we'll go out for a picnic someplace on the White House lawn and then after that maybe we'll start talking about it.
I say, oh, my, oh, it was brutal. You have no idea. OK. Now I call Luther Strange.
I say, oh, I've got to call this guy and he's a no, right? And I say, Senator, I need your help. I said I've got to get your vote on health care. He says you've got it. [Applause] I said, what do you mean I have it? Because I've just been hammered by all of these people.
Right? What do you mean I have it? He said, sir, I was for you right from the beginning, I knew you were going to win, I knew you were going to win the whole thing. I've always been for you, my family has always been for you. And honestly, Mr. President, if you want my vote you have it.
I said, do I have to come and meet you someplace? Do I have to have dinner with your family? I think his wife, by the way, is fantastic. But I said, do I have to have dinner with you and your wife? No, sir, you don't have to have anything. I've supported you from the beginning and you shouldn't even waste anymore time talking to me. Mr.
President, you have my total support. I went home and told my wife that's the coolest thing that's happened to me in six months. OK? It's true. It's a true story. [Applause]
And then time goes by. And he voted and then, of course, you know, John McCain came in and he went thumbs down at 3:00 in the morning. [Booing] Oh, do I know so much, folks, I could tell you. It was sad.
And we had a couple of other senators, but, you know, at least we knew where we stood there. That was, like, really a horrible thing. Honestly, that was a horrible, horrible thing that happened to the Republican Party. That was a horrible thing.
So anyway, so time goes by and I see Luther's in a race. And people are saying he's friendly. Whether you like Mitch McConnell or not, doesn't matter, but they're saying he's friendly with Mitch. He doesn't even know Mitch McConnell.
He was just there for a few months. And they've put that mantle around his neck. And I told Mitch I'd like to say this. You know, I don't like to, but I'm telling you he doesn't know Mitch McConnell at all.
Luther is a tough, tough cookie. He doesn't deal with and kowtow to anybody. So they put it around. So all of a sudden, I see he's down in the race by a lot.
And I said, man, that's really unfair. They were giving him a bum rap because he happened to be in the Senate. They were giving him a bum rap. And I remember the call.
And by the way, the other people that I called, and they're all fine, but you don't even remember. The dinners, you don't even remember any of it. You remember one sentence: Sir, don't even waste your time talking anymore, you have a lot of business to do, you have my vote. This was a definite no.
And I said that's the coolest thing and I remembered it. And I called him. And I checked and he was down because of being saddled with stuff. He was down by quite a bit.
And I said I'm going to endorse you. And he didn't believe it. He said you would do that? I said, yeah, I'm going to do that. I shouldn't be doing it.
The last thing I want to do is be involved in a primary, OK? I could be sitting home right now getting to watch some of the games tomorrow, getting ready, right? But seriously, the last thing I wanted to do is get -- but I'll never forget the way he did that. It was really cool. So what happened is I called him and I said, you know, I want to -- first of all, how are you doing, how are you doing?
And he said, honestly I'm down a little bit, but I think we're going to -- I said I think you're going to come back, too, Luther. I think you're going to come back and you're going to kick everyone's ass and you're going to do great, you're going to do great. [Applause]
Because he got saddled with things that he should not have gotten saddled with. So he started off here, he was in third or fourth, he went to third, second and now it's, like, almost pretty even, right? And I called him up a week ago and I said, you know, I think you're down by a few points, but I'm going to come to Alabama and I'm going to make a speech for you on Friday. [Applause] And such a true story. And as soon as we announced -- you know, you look at this arena.
You know, the media, the fake news I call it, the worst, the fake news... [Booing] ...they won't show this. You know, they'll say Donald Trump spoke before a small crowd in Alabama last night. It was a small crowd, very unenthusiastic crowd, it was a terrible evening.
No, these are among the most dishonest people. I really mean it. These are among the most dishonest. [Applause] For instance, look at the crowd.
I'd love to have them show the crowd, but they don't show the crowd, they show me the whole night. I go home, I say, Melania -- and by the way, she's become very popular, hasn't she? She's become very popular. [Applause] And, I mean, she respects the White House, we love the White House. They actually said about me that I called the White House a dump.
I think the White House is one of the most beautiful buildings I've ever seen. And I speak of it with reverence. And they said that and they wouldn't retract it. And I hated it because I speak so well, I love the White House.
But my wife respects the White House greatly. So when she leaves the plane, we're going to Texas where they had the hurricane, and she leaves the plane and she's dressed appropriately for the White House, you know, because we respect the White House a lot. And she's wearing high heels, like many of you would do. And they went after her.
But she didn't know. And then when she got out in the plane in Texas she was wearing sneakers which she had with her. [Applause] And they know it was dishonest, but that's the way it is. They said she wore high heels.
You know, she's going to go into the floods. She's going to go into the floods with high heels. But she has become very popular. But I have to say this.
So Luther did that for me. And I remembered Luther. We have to be loyal in life, you know. There's something called loyalty with these folks. [Applause]
And I might have made a mistake and I'll be honest I might have made a mistake. Because, you know, here's a story, if Luther doesn't win, they're not going to say we picked up 25 points in a very short period of time. They're going to say Donald Trump, the president of the United States, was unable to pull his candidate across the line. It is a terrible, terrible moment for Trump.
This is total embarrassment. I mean, these are bad people. And by the way, both good men, both good men. And you know what? And I told Luther, I have to say this, if his opponent wins, I'm going to be here campaigning like hell for him. [Applause]
But I have to say this, and you understand this and just look at the polls, Luther will definitely win. [Applause] You know what I'm saying. Roy has a very good chance of not winning in the general election. It's all about the general.
Don't forget, we don't stop here. You have an election coming up the day this is over. So this is over on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, the new race begins.
You've got to beat a Democrat. Luther is going to win easily and Roy's going to have a hard time winning. But I will be backing him if he wins. I will be backing him, OK? I'll tell you that. [Applause]
And just like I backed Huntsville -- because, you know, if you look at Huntsville, billions and billions of dollars from the and to the Army missile defense, what you're going -- how important.
By the way, by the way, how important are those words now when you hear "missile defense?"" Thank you very much
Again, if the other candidate had won against me, that would have gone way down. It was going way down. You don't know what we're doing. We're rebuilding the military at a level to which it's never been before, we're rebuilding. [Applause]
But that would have gone way, way down. And then you look at, as an example, the new FBI facility that's being build. Great, great. You look at NASA, how about NASA? Billions of dollars. [Applause]
And Richard Shelby, by the way, has been a big help on this, I have to tell you, a big help. [Applause] He's been a big help. But I will say this. We're spending a tremendous amount of money in Alabama and you are doing great.
And as long as I'm president, you are going to have so much money spent here. And you know what? Lots of other states also. We're bringing back jobs. We're bringing back companies, companies are not building in other areas, in some cases they've already started the plant and they're not, they're coming back. [Applause]
I'm renegotiating NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever made. It's one of the worst trade deals ever made. [Applause] We stopped other trade deals. We are doing a job.
We are -- I'll tell you what, we have jobs and companies pouring back into this country like they haven't seen, the lowest unemployment in almost 17 years. [Applause] The most number of jobs. The most number of jobs in the history of our country. Now, with all of that being said, we have a lot of people that want to work, we have a lot of people that have given up on finding jobs.
Those people are going to be taken care of. That's one of the reasons that we, we as a group, that's why we won. One of the reasons. I think we won because of the military.
I think we won because of the vets. I think we won because of the evangelicals. I mean, take a look at that, right? [Applause] But I had to tell that story about Luther because, you know what, you go back and tell it, I thought it was really cool. So I said I'll be there.
And then I saw some things that I didn't like. He was down a little further than I liked. I said I'm not sure. And I said, Luther, you have got what it takes.
You have really got it and let's go. And that was two months ago. And you've got yourself an even race. If you guys go out and vote, if he gets out the vote, you're going to win.
You're going to have a great senator. [Applause] You're going to have a great senator. And he won't only be great, he'll be the tallest senator in the history of the United States Senate. It's OK, that's not so bad, right? [Applause] And Shelby's pretty tall, too, by the way.
But he is going to be great because he's tough on crime, he's tough on borders. [Applause] Don't worry, don't even think about it. And you know who I have here tonight? General John Kelly who headed up homeland security. [Applause] And what a job he did on the borders.
Where's General? Where is he? Where is he? General, come up here quick. Come here. Come here. Four-star, come here, come, come, come, come, come. [Applause]
This guy, what a great man this is. No games, you know? You know the expression? There's no games being played. Four-star Marine, there are very few, four-star general. [Applause, Kelly greets crowd] He just wants to work.
He's done a great job. Four-star Marine, that's good. But what he did on the borders, and this is without the wall -- by the way, the wall is happening, folks, OK. Believe me, the wall is happening. [Applause]
In fact, you probably saw, you know, we have a wall up there now and we're renovating it already, it's being made pristine, perfect, just as good as new, although we may go a little bit higher than that, but that's OK. And we're building samples of the new wall. You know, it has to be a see-through wall. I don't know if you know this, frankly, I didn't know it until about a year ago, as much as I say.
If you can't have vision through it you don't know who's on the other side. Let's say we build a pre-cast concrete wall and now we have people on the other side. Literally, I was given an example. It's so bad, it's going to stop drugs, it's going to stop a lot of bad things because the drug epidemic in this country is out of control, we're going to stop it.
And I called the other day, I spoke to your governor. I said, how are you doing? She said, well, we have about 17 million people that just entered Alabama for shelter.
We're going to stop it. [Applause] But they would literally -- so you have a concrete wall, and that's what I do best, that's what I do, that's what I really do, although we done a good job at politics, too. In all fairness, we've only been doing it for about two years. [Applause] But I do best, I build.
So you have a concrete wall and you have Mexico, wonderful, wonderful place, Mexico, and you have over here the United States. But you can't see anything, right? So now they take drugs literally and they throw it, a hundred pounds of drugs. They throw it over the wall, they have catapults, but they throw it over the wall and it lands and it hits somebody on the head, you don't even know they're there. Believe it or not, this is the kind of stuff that happens.
So you need to have a great wall, but it has to be see-through. We are now looking at samples. We have four samples that have already been built, General, right? They've been built. And we're looking at different samples already of see-through walls.
And I think also I have to be honest with you, a see-through wall would look better. You know, you don't have that whatever it might be. But we are looking at four different samples built by four great companies, four different concepts. They're just about completed.
I'm going to go out and look at them personally, I'm going to pick the right one. We're renovating the existing wall. And we are going to have as much wall as we need. You don't need it all the way.
You know, you have 2,000 miles, you don't need it because you have a lot of natural barriers, et cetera. Somebody said, well, what are you going to do? Are you going to build that wall in the middle of the river that nobody can go in? Are you going to build that wall on the mountain? I said you don't need the wall on the mountain, you have a mountain which is a wall. But we're going to build the wall, it's coming along great. We're soon going to have the final choices done.
And the renovations will be done, I would say, within the next six or seven months. We're spending a tremendous amount of money and we're going to have that. So I just wanted to let you know where we are. [Applause] So we're very, very happy about that, you know, because every once in a while you hear, well, you know, he doesn't really want to build the wall.
I say, excuse me? That's the great thing about Twitter, OK? [Applause] You know, when the press is dishonest, which is most of the time, and when they say, like, I don't want to build a wall, I can tweet that was a false story, boom, boom, boom. [Applause] No. You know, it's really not a question about we want to do a wall, but we really have to do a wall in order to stop the drugs in particular. And we've been dealing with ICE, we've been dealing with the Border Patrol.
They both endorsed me, first time they've ever endorsed a candidate for president. And these guys know better than anybody. They know better than the architects, better than the consultants. [Applause] This country used to go out and get consultants.
They'd spend a fortune on consultants to say what to do, how to build it and everything. They didn't have a clue. They got out of the Harvard school of something and they'd write about a wall. Let me just tell you, the best guys to tell you what to do are the Border Patrol or ICE.
These are the guys that know. And you know what it costs? It costs nothing, nothing. We get it free and they're happy to do it. I was with them two weeks ago.
They're happy to do it. So it's really great and it's just going to be a very important element to making America great again, like your hat. [Applause] When it comes to reforming Washington and taking on the bureaucracy, I'm telling you, because I've seen him, he's tough as hell, Luther is your man. Luther wants to end business as usual, stop the insider dealing and Luther Strange is determined to drain that swamp. [Applause]
Luther's been fighting hard for the people of Alabama and for the people of the United States since his first job in office. Now, I have to tell you something, he hasn't been there very long. And again, he doesn't know those people. He had never met them, he doesn't know them, and they can't saddle him with it, but he doesn't know those people.
But Luther has worked so hard. And I know the ones that work hard and I know the ones that don't work hard. In fact, I was talking about it with Richard before. Don't worry, Richard, I'm not going to give away any of these secrets.
But we were talking about it. We were talking about -- he's a hard worker, Richard, I want to tell you that. He's been working hard for 34 years. [Applause] But we were talking, we were talking about who are the smart ones, who are the hardworking ones.
We talked about who are the less- smart ones, too. I learned a lot. That's a lot of knowledge. But Luther shares our convictions and our vision.
And maybe most importantly, he shares our agenda. Remember, he's going to win the race. He's going to win the race. [Applause] And I'm not talking here, I'm talking against the Democrat, which starts very quickly.
But it's why we need each and every one of you to get a friend, go out, get a family member, get the whole family and bring them out to vote for "Big Luther"" Strange. You've got to vote for him
Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag to say get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired, he's fired. [Applause, Audience Chants USA] You know, some owner is going to do that.
He's going to say that guy that disrespects our flag, he's fired. [Applause] And that owner, they don't know it, they don't know it, they're friends of mine, many of them, they don't know it, they'll be the most popular person for a week, they'll be the most popular person in this country because that's a total disrespect of our heritage, that's a total disrespect of everything that we stand for, OK? Everything that we stand for.
And I know we have freedoms and we have freedom of choice and many, many different freedoms. But you know what? It's still totally disrespectful. And, you know, when the NFL ratings are down massively, massively... [Applause] The NFL ratings are down massively.
Now, the number-one reason happens to be that they like watching what's happening on, you know, with yours truly. [Applause] They like what's happening. Because, you know, today if you hit too hard, right, they hit too hard, 15 yards, throw him out of the game. They had that last week.
I watched for a couple of minutes and two guys just really a beautiful tackle, boom, 15 yards. The referee gets on television, his wife it sitting at home, she's so proud of him, they're ruining the game. Right? [Applause] They're ruining the game. Hey, look, that's what they want to do, they want to hit, OK? They want to hit.
But it is hurting the game. But you know what's hurting the game more than that? When people like yourselves turn on television and you see those people taking the knee when they're playing our great "National Anthem."" [Booing] The only thing you could do better is if you see it
Not the same game anymore anyway. Now, one of the things we've done, and when I say "we"" it's us
Right? We cherish our magnificent Constitution and we believe judges must interpret the Constitution as written and that includes defending, as I just said, our great Second Amendment. [Applause] We support the rule of law and we stand strong with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause] We protect our citizens, uphold our traditions and we will always defend our borders. [Applause] These are Alabama values.
I understand the people of Alabama. I feel like I'm from Alabama, frankly. [Applause] Isn't it a little weird when a guy who lives on 5th Avenue in the most beautiful apartment you've ever seen comes to Alabama and Alabama loves that guy. I mean, it's crazy, it's crazy. [Applause]
It's crazy. But I do, I understand your values, I love your values and those are the values that I believe in. Those are the values, those are the values that made this country. Those are the values that made this country great.
Those are the values. I understand those values. [Applause] But as you know, these values have been under attack for many years in Washington. And that's why we need a person like Luther Strange.
We need him. You've got to get out and vote. [Applause] You know, I think if everybody in this room gets out and votes, Luther, you win easily. You've got to vote.
Just get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. [Applause] So Luther's not in Washington to serve the special interests, like a lot of people. Even the way he handled that thing with me.
He didn't ask me, oh, you've got to do this and that. In the end, what did he do? He got better. I would never have done that. Let's say he was difficult.
I would never, but he never went quid pro quo, he just treated me great. And I called him, I said, you want me to help you? He couldn't believe it. He said, why? I said because you gave me the coolest answer I've had in a long time. That's why I'm here, he didn't ask me. [Applause]
The only mistake he made, I shouldn't say this, he said, sir, we have a venue that holds a thousand people. I said, Luther, that's no good, a thousand people, we can do much better than that. And then we came up with this job and we are packed. And by the way, outside there are thousands of people that can't get in, they do not have your real estate ability.
OK? Thousands, you've got thousands of people outside. [Applause] Thousands. And they may be listening because we put some big speakers out there and I hope they're going to vote for Luther. They may not be too happy.
But I think they will. So Luther came to Washington to serve you and to represent you. And I can tell you that when "Big Luther
We don't have to go into it because a lot of them are now friends of mine, a lot of them are friends of mine. So nobody ever called you "Big Luther?"" I think it's a great name. The guy is 7 feet tall. What are you going to do? Call him -- I can never call him little Luther
But when he walks in, everybody knows that Alabama has arrived. [Applause] Luther was a very, very advanced Eagle Scout who has not spent his lifetime in politics. He only entered public life in recent years. And he's been in Washington for even less time than me, so he doesn't know all these people that he's supposed to know.
He has his own mind. He has the mind that you want. In his short time in public office, Luther has proved that he's not beholden to anyone and not afraid to take on anyone. And I've seen it.
As your attorney general in Alabama, Luther won over 25 public corruption convictions. [Applause] And now he's brought that same political courage to Washington. And I have to tell you, friends of mine, because I have a lot of friends in Alabama.
And friends of mine have told me very strongly that if Luther wasn't appointed to office for the short term, if he just said he's going to run when you have to run, which is now, he'd be leading every poll by 50 points, he'd be killing everybody. But the fact that he got appointed hurt him.
In fact, he was thinking about not accepting that. But if Luther just didn't take an appointment, if he just ran, there wouldn't even be a contest. Nobody could come close to him. So it's one of those things.
But I can tell you personally, because I've been dealing with him for the months that he's been there, I'm very lucky and this country is very lucky that he did take that appointment because he's done a hell of a job. [Applause] And that's what we need in Washington, people who have the courage to stand strong for our values, our family, our nation, people who have the courage to challenge a failed system.
Look with Obamacare, I've been listening for seven years as many of these people -- now, Richard kept voting against it, but many of these kept saying repeal and replace, repeal and replace. Then they finally have now -- they didn't care, nobody cared because they had a president that wasn't going to sign it and they didn't have the Senate, so it didn't matter.
So it didn't take much courage. So they were getting all these great votes, you know, like, I think they voted, what, 61 times, like, 61 times to repeal and replace. They finally get a president who will sign the legislation and they don't have the guts to vote for it. OK? They don't have the guts to vote for it. [Booing]
And I was told congratulations, you won, you won. You know why I won? Because the Electoral College is a very special thing. And I decided, very, I think, intelligently, to campaign in the states that you have to win for the Electoral College victory that you need. You know, it's very simple, very simple. [Applause]
I took a pass on a lot of states, the Electoral College, and I've never really been in favor of it, but now I appreciate it. No, no, I tell you what. To me, winning the popular vote is easier because you go to New York, you go to California, you go to Texas. The beauty with the Electoral College is I was going to Maine, I was going all over.
I was going to smaller states It brings the whole country into play. It brings certain states into play that would never really be thought of. [Applause] But I focused heavily on Pennsylvania and North Carolina. I focused very heavily here.
But I actually made one speech here. And I said, fellow and folks, do you mind if I don't come back for a while because we have, like, a 38-point lead and I'd much rather spend my time in Florida, which we won quite easily, and Pennsylvania and North Carolina and lots of other places. [Applause] So, Alabama, you were great. I mean, we won by so much.
So the Electoral College is actually something I've come to respect. But it's sort of, like, if you're a 100-yard dash guy or if you're a long- distance runner, you train differently. Well, if you're going for the Electoral College, that's a much different race. So if Hillary runs again in four years, which I hope she does, we're going to teach her... [Booing]
...we're going to teach her to spend more time in Michigan. We're going to teach her to go to Wisconsin. We're going to teach her to spend a little more capability in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida, which she lost, and she actually spent a tremendous amount of money. So I just want to -- because, you know, you hear so much about this.
Remember this: If you're going for the Electoral College, it's a much different race. You don't spend your time in California and New York and these different places. You spend your time in Iowa and Ohio. Remember? You can't win unless you win Ohio.
Well, we won Ohio by a lot because I spent a lot of time up there. [Applause] But I would rather have the popular vote count because for me it would be easier than winning the Electoral College, which they said a Republican could not win, if you remember. Remember, they said there is no way to 270 for Trump. That's why I went to Maine four times because I needed one, I needed one.
They said there is no way. Well, we ended up with 306. There is no way. I guess they were right. [Applause]
No, no, Luther, they were right. They were 100 percent right. There is no way to 270, yes, but there is a way to 306. OK? So we won by a lot.
But when you hear all this nonsense, when you're a golfer and you have match play or you're a golfer and you have stroke play, different tournament, you train differently. Same with runners, same with lots of other things. So they have to learn their lesson. They have to campaign in areas that really matter.
But we had such a great victory it was just something that was awe-inspiring and something that I think everybody in this room will never, ever forget. And I appreciate the fact that the people of Alabama were with me right from the first day. And they said to me don't come back, go to those other states that you have to work. I appreciate it. [Applause]
And by the way, folks, just in case you're, like, curious, no, Russia did not help me. OK? Russia. [Applause] I call it the Russian hoax, one of the great hoaxes. Actually, that's the thing I was thinking about.
That's the thing that the Democrats did best. They lost the election and they didn't know what happened. And they needed an excuse, so they said Russia. And then they said, wait a minute, wait a minute, Russia and Trump.
Honestly? It's the thing they did best. They did a rotten job of running. But to convince people about this hoax, that was probably the thing that they did best, but it is one great hoax. No, Russia did not help me, that I can tell you, OK. [Applause]
Any Russians in the audience? Are there any Russians in the audience please? I don't see too many Russians. I didn't see too many Russians in Pennsylvania. I didn't see too many Russians. We need people in this country who have the courage to say what they mean, to do what they say and never, ever to back down.
As your attorney general, Luther helped you lead the fight in court against the Obama administration's big power grabs. That includes challenging the EPA's clean power plan, which, by the way, did you see what I did to that? Boom, gone. Look at that guy, he knows. Gone. [Applause]
And I did that one without Luther. But he defended it and got rid of a lot of things on a state level. And also, I've defended and Luther has defended so vigorously religious liberty from Obamacare and the fighting of Obama's and the administration's dangerous, dangerous, really almost you could say inhumane plan on refugees. It's inhumane.
When I opened my election, I talked about what was happening, the viciousness of what was happening. A lot of people thought it was tough, turned out to be true. In fact, it turned out to be understated, not overstated. And that was a big part of our success.
Since the day "Big Luther"" arrived in the United States Senate
I'm just telling you he doesn't know him, he just just got there. I said, how well do you know him? He said I just met him, because he just got there. He's been there for a very short period of time. And in fact, he just came out against, and he was against it before, but he just came out against that totally ridiculous rule, the filibuster rule.
It's ridiculous. [Applause] So we have 52 senators. And on a lot of legislation, you need 60 votes. That means we have to get eight Democrats.
And then they get upset with me when I go to see Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, who are very nice, they get upset. Why did you see them? I said because this rule is crazy. We have 260 bills. Many of those bills, not all of them, because they can use reconciliation for those of you that are interested in that, but that's a trick, that's just a trick, many of those bills will never get passed, most of them won't because you cannot get 60 votes, you cannot.
It means that eight Democrats control the Senate. Now, I think we're going to pick up seats in '18. I'm going to work very hard. I think we're going to pick up Democratic seats, I believe that. [Applause]
We're going to pick up Democratic seats, but they have to get rid of the filibuster rule. Basically, we can't go to 60, we want 51. That's how we have Judge Gorsuch. If we didn't have that, you would not have Judge Gorsuch right now on the Supreme Court. [Applause]
Luther was with us on withdrawing the United States from the deeply unfair, job-killing Paris climate accord. OK? [Applause] You know, it sounds so nice, but it was a killer. It was a killer for our country and it was very unfair. As an example, we kick in now -- China, who I love right now, this week.
Don't forget, that was a big thing. Got a 15 to nothing vote twice. And I must say, Russia and China both came along, they both came along, that was a great thing. [Applause] And maybe more importantly, maybe it's more important, but maybe more importantly that when China did this banking thing, that's so big.
Let's see. I'll let you know if it's big in a little while. Let's see what happens, OK? Let's see what happens. But certainly, it's never been done and I think you're going to see some good things.
I think China wants to get this problem over with, they don't need it. That's their part of the world, they don't need it. They do not need this problem. And they're very smart and they're good people.
And the president is a really good man and he loves China. But it's good for China getting rid of that menace. It's really good for China, believe me. [Applause] Luther's with us on cracking down on dangerous sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens into our communities.
What's that all about? [Booing] And by the way, Jeff Sessions is working very hard on that, really hard, really hard and effectively, very effectively. [Applause] Luther is with us on cutting taxes and bringing jobs back to America. He's with us on giving our military the tools, unlimited. He wants the military taken care of and funding the fight so that we win without question and that's where we're going, $700 billion. [Applause]
He not only has my endorsement, remember this, he also has the endorsement of my great friend and vice president, Mike Pence. [Applause] He has the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, the NRA. That's a biggie, that's a big one. Luther, that's big. [Applause]
He's got the endorsement of the National Right to Life and the Alabama farmers, that's big stuff. [Applause] Those a big endorsements. That NRA endorsement, I'm telling you, that is a powerful endorsement. With Luther Strange, you don't just send a message to Washington, you send a fighter to change Washington the way we all know it can be.
Since Election Day on November 8th, we've already achieved historic wins for the American people. The stock market has reached its highest point in history. [Applause] They hate it. They hate to hear that, oh.
We're up, like, 22 percent since November, 22 percent since Election Day. I think it's even more than that. But it's reached the highest point, think of it, the highest point. And unemployment is at the lowest level it's been for 16 years, close to 17. [Applause]
Most importantly to me, and I have to say it and I'll say it again because I said it at the beginning, but I have to sort of wrap it up and say it again, companies are flowing back into our country. They want to be here. [Applause]
I was with one of the great gentlemen that I became friendly with, a leader of a major, major country, so I won't tell you because I said I'd keep it private, so, you know, there are only probably a lot of people watching on television. Oh, look at all those red lights.
It's always fun to see a red light. Like, CNN has a red light on. And then I start saying it's fake news and you see that light go off so fast. [Applause] By the way, do you think they showed the room? Look, do you think they showed up the little nooks and crannies of this? Do you think they showed the room? I don't think so. [Applause]
If there's an empty seat, they'll show that empty seat. Two people, they got up, they went to the bathroom, they're coming back in five, they show those empty seats every single time. [Applause] Fake news. So I'm really proud because a record, in the history of our country, stock market, tremendous gains.
People that run companies, that truly hate me, they now love me. They're coming up, Mr. President, sir, I'm making them all, everybody -- and that means jobs, it means everybody. I'm serious.
People that truly dislike your president, the heads of these companies are coming up and hugging me and kissing me and, oh, they are just -- but I'm not doing it for them, I'm doing it for jobs, I'm doing it for the country. That I can tell you. [Applause]
Doing it for the country. I told you many times during the campaign, but I told you many times, and this is not even a choice, we're renegotiating NAFTA and we're either going to get a fair deal or we're going to terminate NAFTA.
It's very simple, OK? Because it's one of the worst deals ever, ever negotiated. [Applause] One of the worst deals ever negotiated. Every day I am keeping my promise. We have done so much.
You know, they don't like to say it, but we've passed over 50 pieces of legislation. That means going through Congress, that means getting approved by the House and the Senate and signing. That's not including all of the executive orders I've signed. That's not including the fact that we have reduced unnecessary regulations to a point that this country hasn't seen in years.
And we're not finished yet. [Applause] But one of my biggest promises has been to our great veterans. And we are doing one of our best jobs there. [Applause] We are doing one of our best jobs with our veterans.
We publish online wait times at every VA facility, opened the promised White House VA hotline, extended Veterans' Choice. Do you know what that is? The veterans, our greatest people, these are our greatest, our bravest, our most wonderful people. [Applause] And in some cases, they get older and things happen. They're waiting in line for seven days, for nine days, for 16 days.
And in some cases, they die. In some cases, they could have a simple procedure, they can have a simple prescription and it takes 11 or 12 days to get off line to see the doctor. By the time they get to the doctor, they're terminal. So I said, without knowing much, but having a lot of common sense and very good up here, always, always... [Applause]
But I said, you know, like you people, I said that doesn't make sense if they're waiting in line. Can you imagine, we have a lot of people that are very successful people here, can you imagine going to your doctor and having him say you'll have to wait for 11 days?
If I have to wait for two seconds I go crazy. Hopefully, we don't have to see too many doctors, that's even better, right? But they wait for days and days. And now they go, right outside, they go to a doctor in the area, we pay the bill and it's the least expensive thing we can do and we save everybody's life and everybody's happy. [Applause]
Everybody's happy. And when I first heard, because I've only been doing this for a little while, but when I first heard of the problem, that's what I said. Why aren't they just going to see a doctor we'll pay? And we've got to negotiate with the doctors pretty careful because, you know, I know a lot about doctors where they charge a lot of money, so we've got to be a little careful. But now the people are happy.
We are doing so many things. We have VA worker accountability. For 40 years they've been trying to get it passed, they couldn't. I will not blame the unions and I will not blame civil service.
But that was the problem, OK? You have the unions, you have the -- they didn't want it. For 40 years, they couldn't get it passed. So you would have people working in the VA who were sadists, who would abuse our great, great people, our great veterans. By the way, 25 years before, they would have had their ass kicked by the same person that they're abusing.
They would have been in trouble. [Applause] They would have been in trouble. Twenty-five years earlier, they wouldn't be doing it. But that's the way it is.
But they're sadists or they're doing a bad job or they're not working. You couldn't fire them. I had passed the VA Accountability Act. We have a great man, David Shulkin, Dr.
David Shulkin, he's running the VA. He has done more in eight months than they've done at the VA for years and years and years. And it's really getting good over there, so very proud of him because I made that promise. [Applause] And in the best tradition of America's greatest leaders, we're standing up for American workers and defending American jobs and American industry. [Applause]
We're building our future with American hands, American labor and American iron, aluminum and steel. We will buy American, we will hire American. In first month in office... [Applause] ...I withdrew the United States from the disastrous and job- killing, it would have been a disaster, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
A great ripoff. You want to see jobs leave the country, sign that. And they were going to sign that as fast as they could. That was a disaster for this country.
We're eliminating unnecessary regulations so we can create more jobs and wealthy right here in America. I've ended the Obama administration's war on coal and we're putting our wonderful coal miners back to work producing beautiful clean coal. [Applause]
And here's one that nobody had the guts to do and I did it in my first very few days in office. I authorized the construction of the Keystone Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline, over 50,000 jobs, 50,000 beautiful construction jobs. [Applause]
And environmentally better, much better. We've increased our military and defense budget to the highest level it's been probably ever. [Applause] It's going to be over $700 billion. We're going to rebuild it.
We are rebuilding. We're ordering new fighters, we're ordering new jets. You know what's been happening. The jets are so old that the father flew them and then the son goes into the Air Force and he flies the same plane.
True. And we've committed to expanding and improving a state-of-the-art missile defense system. Thank you very much, Huntsville, Alabama. Thank you.
Thank you, Huntsville. Right? [Applause] It's amazing the way all of a sudden missile defense system sounds so good. And by the way, these systems, I watch them and I see what's being developed. I mean, they're taking out rockets that are going so fast and the percentage of success is so high, it's so brilliant what we can do so that we can do what we have to do to have a safe country.
So I want to thank you, Huntsville, because you're a big part of it. [Applause] We've just brought back the National Space Council to restore America's legacy of leadership in space, it leads to so many things. [Applause] The council will be chaired by Vice President Pence who is visiting your NASA facility in Huntsville on Monday to get you out to vote. That's why, get you out to vote. [Applause]
And we're making our communities safe again by going after violent criminals and putting dangerous offenders behind bars. They're going in fast, they're going in fast. [Applause] We have the backs of our police officers, our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers. And we have their backs 100 percent, just like they take care of us. [Applause]
One by one we're finding, and I mean in large numbers, and our guys are much tougher than their guys, we're finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminals who prey on our people. We're throwing them the hell out of our country and we will not let them back in. They don't come back in anymore. It's a different age. [Applause]
They don't come back in. We also understand that immigration security is a national, it's really a national treasure, but it's a national security. We need national security for safety. We're going to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.
Sorry, sorry. [Applause] Call up some of the other countries in the world, say, how are you doing, folks? Not so good. We're creating an immigration system that puts American workers and American families first. We're moving quickly to pass a massive tax cut and simplification for the middle class.
We want new tax returns, we want simplification, we want reform. And you know what we really want? We want massive tax cuts. That's what we're doing for business, that's what we're doing for the middle class. [Applause] If we want to restore American prosperity, we need tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and pro-American. [Applause]
The United States currently has the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, 60 percent higher than other developed countries. This is a massive economic disadvantage for America costing us millions and millions of jobs and trillions of dollars. Under our plan that you're going to see next week -- enjoy it, OK, enjoy it. You're going to love it... [Applause]
...it'll be the biggest tax cut. I've got to get it approved by Richard and by Luther, but I have a feeling you'll be OK. Luther, you promise? Because if you don't vote for it, I'm leaving right now. I'm going to take away -- if he doesn't vote for it, I'm taking away the endorsement.
No, but under Luther and under Richard, we're going to have one of the lowest tax rates in the developed world, bringing back our jobs, our companies, bringing them back to our shores. With Luther's help, we're going to reform our tax code to make American business competitive again so that American workers and American companies can win again. [Applause]
We're going to bring back to our country three, four, maybe five, nobody even knows what the number is, but many trillions of dollars that is currently parked overseas. And it will be invested right here in the good old USA.
It's coming back into our country. Right now it's impossible to get it back. [Applause] We're committed to protecting small businesses and family farmers by ending the death tax on estates. [Applause] You lose your farm, you lose your business, you can't pay the tax, we're getting rid of the death tax.
In addition to passing historic tax reforms, Luther and I are totally dedicated to repealing and replacing Obamacare. Now, I have to tell you, maybe we're going to do it now. It's a little tougher without McCain's vote, I'll be honest, it's a little tougher, but we've got some time. We're going to go back.
You know, it's like a boxer, they get knocked down, get up, get knocked down, get up, get knocked down, and then the bad ones they stay on the stool and they say we quit, we quit. The great ones get up and they end up winning. That's what we're going to do. [Applause] We might have to go back again and again.
I mean, like, we may make it this time. But the most we'll be is one or two votes short. You can't quit when you have one or two votes short, you can't do it. And those people are not going to be liked by the communities that they come from.
Because in most cases, in I think almost all of the cases, they got elected on the basis of repealing and replacing and they are not doing a service to the people that they represent. [Applause] Luther Strange fought against Obamacare as attorney general of Alabama and he fought it well. And he's fighting Obamacare in the Senate and he's going to keep fighting because we're going to win. It's going to be gone.
And we're going to have great health care in this country. [Applause] Your premiums are surging, your deductibles are through the roof. Alabama's way up, but we have states that are up 150 percent. We have one state, the state of Alaska, it's up more than 200 percent.
And I'm having a hard time getting a certain vote, but she's a good person and I think she's going to come through. I mean, if you look, Alaska is up over 200 percent. So that means Obamacare is no good. So we shouldn't have a hard time getting her vote and I think she's going to come through.
I hope so. Insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting, choices are disappearing. Congress must do its job by ending the Obamacare nightmare. [Applause] So to deliver for American families, we are also working to pass the RAISE Act, legislation that would end chain migration and switch our country to a merit-based immigration system, merit, merit, merit, people that will help our country, people that will help our country. [Applause]
We have Tom Cotton, we have David Perdue, two great senators, and they're working on it. The RAISE Act would keep new immigrants from going on welfare for five years. Isn't that nice? They don't walk over and say I'm going on welfare. Isn't that nice.
Maybe keep them from ever going on welfare. And would require them to support themselves and their families financially. [Applause] It's time to create an immigration system that serves the interests of the United States of America. We also want an infrastructure bill that generates $1 trillion of investment in rebuilding our country with American hands and skill and grit.
We want to lift Americans from welfare to work, from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity. [Applause] Right? We want every American child to grow up learning the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job well done. [Applause]
We want our citizens to go to work every morning in a job they love, supporting their families and lifting up their communities, like you people have done so well. But we can only bring prosperity back to our country and hope to our struggling communities if we can take our America first agenda, if we can take our make America great again agenda back to Washington and drive it to victory.
We can only achieve those historic legislative wins, and we've had a lot of them in a short period of time, if we have patriots in Congress who are willing to stand up and fight for what we believe. And that guy can do it. [Applause] We can only win those fights and we can only drain the swamp if we have smart, tough and tenacious leaders who know who they represent and they know how to deliver. Luther Strange is our man.
He's our man. You've got to get out and vote. [Applause] I mean, again, I'm taking a big risk because if Luther doesn't make it they're going to go after me, Luther, these people, these very dishonest people. They're going to say Trump, Trump, Trump, OK? But we've done great together and we have done great over the last two months right here.
This is our moment, this is your moment. This is a big day because you have a lot of people banking on somebody else's victory and then thinking they're going to become Democrats in the state of Alabama. And I don't think that's a good thing. [Booing] That's not a good thing.
If this man wins, that race is over. If somebody else wins, I will tell you, that's going to be a very tough race. Every day, we must fight for the change you've been waiting for your entire life, for a government that serves you, that protects your family, that upholds your laws and that honors your faith and that defends values and that always puts the needs of our citizens first. [Applause] We are Americans and the future belongs to us.
The future belongs to all of you. But we have got to go out and take it. We have got to go out and earn it. We have got to go out and vote.
If we don't vote, it's not going to happen. So on Tuesday, vote for your country, vote for your family, vote for your victory, vote for Luther Strange, he's a phenomenal person. [Applause]
And together with the great people of Alabama, and you're giant in the Senate, we will make America strong again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again! Thank you, Alabama. I love you. Thank you. I love you, Alabama.
Thank you, Indiana. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And thank you for giving America a truly amazing person in Mike Pence. He's a great, great man and a great vice president. Thank you, Indiana. Thank you. Great. I'm thrilled to be back in this great state with thousands of hard-working American patriots.
We are here to celebrate our amazing achievements together. And by the way, how were those jobs numbers today? How were they? How were they? And to make sure America's incredible comeback continues moving full-speed ahead, in just four days, the people of Indiana are going to send Mike Braun to the United States Senate... so we can keep making America great again.
Thank you. This election will decide whether we build on the extraordinary prosperity that we've unleashed or whether we let the radical Democrats take control of Congress... and take a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to our future. It's not going to happen. America now has the best economy in the history of our country.
Could you believe this? Can you believe this? Way ahead of schedule. And if I would have said that during the campaign, where I spent a lot of days and nights with you, and I was with another special friend of ours, Bobby Knight, who's going to be speaking in a couple of minutes... The great Bobby Knight.
But if I would have told you the kind of numbers that we've achieved, nobody would have believed it, and they would not have let us get away with it, but we would have gotten away with it anyway. We would have gotten away with it. It turned out that we were underestimating as opposed to overestimating. In the last month alone, we added another 250,000 jobs and nearly 600,000 Americans returned to the workforce.
Nobody would believe it. We've created 4.5 million new jobs since the election. Nobody would have believed that. The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in more than 50 years. And more Americans are working today than ever before. How about that? But how is that statistic? How is that? How is that statistic?
Think of that. I mean, of all statistics. In the history of our country -- think of this -- more Americans are working right now today in this country than have ever worked in this country before. It's an amazing statistic. That's going to be fun on the debate stage when we debate one of the lefties. And -- and they're going to be saying what a good job they're going to do by raising your taxes and all -- and we're going to say, but we have more people working now than ever worked.
You know, I think we're going to win that debate. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached the lowest levels in the history of our country. And in case you haven't noticed, in the great state of Indiana, we are putting our steelworkers back to work at a level that nobody thought possible.
One of the great stories -- it's one of the great stories -- you know, we taxed all of the steel dumping from other countries that don't exactly have us in mind. And we taxed them at 25 percent. And guess what? Our steel industry is one of the hottest industries in the country right now. It's expanding like crazy.
And right here in Indiana, Steel Dynamics has just announced a $75 million investment in Columbia City and a $400 million investment in Terre Haute. You know that, right? It's a lot of money. And just three months ago, United States Steel announced a $750 million investment in a place called Gary, Indiana.
The fact is, after years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. It's about time. It's about time. [Audience chants USA] Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families and, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, and America is winning like never before, because we are finally putting America first!
But if cryin' Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi... and the legendary Maxine Waters... if they take power, they will try to erase our gains and eradicate our progress. Can't let that happen. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. They want to restore job-killing regulations. They want to shut down your steel mills.
And that will happen. They want to take away your real health care and use socialism to turn America into Venezuela. Lovely place, lovely place. And Democrats want to totally open borders. How do you like that sound? Come on in. Come on in, everybody, just come on. [Audience chants Build that wall] You're right.
And we're building the wall. We've got $1.6 billion. We have another $1.6 billion. We have a third $1.6 billion coming. But we want to the build it quickly at one time. We don't want to do it piecemeal, but it's started. It's doing well. We want the money now from the Democrats. We need their votes. Or, an easier way, elect more Republicans.
We don't need their votes. The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan. And you see we have more caravans forming. You do see that. Gee, I wonder how that happens. I wonder how. I think they overplayed their hand on this one, folks, because between Justice Kavanaugh and the caravans, you people are energized.
And they want these caravans for illegal aliens to flood into our country, overwhelming your schools, depleting your resources, and endangering your communities. Republicans want strong borders, no drugs, no gangs, and we want no caravans, thank you. The choice in this election could not be more simple. A Republican Congress means more jobs and less crime.
That's not bad. Think of that, how beautiful. More jobs, less crime. How nice. How nice. So how do you -- how do you get elected when you go, let's say, less crime, hey, folks, it's very simple. We've got to stop the crime. We've got to close up -- we've got to close up the borders. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit.
They have to come in through merit. And by the way, at 3.7 percent unemployment, a 50-year low, we need people to come in because we have companies coming back into our country. Some of them left years ago. And they're coming back into Indiana and Michigan and Ohio and North Carolina and South Carolina and Pennsylvania and Florida and every state.
They're pouring back in, because, you know what? As two of the executives told me two days ago, we want to be where the action is. That's right. We have the -- we have now the hottest economy in the world. When did you hear that last? So, this Tuesday, vote Republican. We are thrilled to be joined tonight by an Indiana legend, a man who's become a friend of mine, who truly knows what winning is all about.
And I have to tell you this quick story, you know, look, it's Bobby Knight, he's the greatest, OK? But I have to tell you, I have to tell you. So before I ran, but my name was being thrown out, I get a call, I told a little bit, maybe you heard this, but it's a great story. I get a call, and my secretary comes in. Sir, do you know somebody named Bobby Knight?
I said, well, I don't know him, but I know of him. He's a great, great coach, if it's the same guy, but it's probably not. So find out. They say, yes, sir, it's the coach. I said, let me check it. So, you know, you get a lot of crank calls, so I figure maybe it's 90 percent a crank call. I pick up. "Hello, Trump?
This is Bobby Knight." I said, that's him. Nobody could imitate that. Nobody. He's Bobby Knight, and you got to run for president. I said, well, I'm thinking about it. It was a year before. I'm thinking about it. But he said, you got to run, you'll do better, you're the only one going to turn the ship around.
You got to run for president. I said, you know what, Bobby? If you could -- I am thinking about it, Bobby, seriously, and if you could, how about giving me your number, and I'll call you if I decide to do it, especially when I come to campaign in a place called Indiana, right? Right? So I said, Bobby, could you give me the number?
And he gives me the number. I write it down. Bum, bum, bum, and I write it down. And I put it -- and on my desk, you know, I'm a hard worker, I have a lot of stuff, I'm doing deals all over the places before this whole political thing got started. And I have two or three piles of stacks of paper. They're like two or three feet high each.
I write his number, I put it in the pile. A year goes by. And now I'm running, and I'm doing well. I never left center stage. Do you know what that means? That means in the debates we never lost a debate, we never lost center stage. Some of the guys were being pushed left, they were being pushed right. We never lost center stage, right?
And I always said to the people running the debates, I want an odd number, because I'm in center, and I don't want to have an even number, because then two people are in center, right? But I never left center stage, and I'm doing well, and I'm going, and we had some competition, but it was fine. And everything's -- and now I'm getting ready to come to a place called Indiana.
And a friend of mine, who's also a great friend of Mike Pence, calls me and said you're doing really well in Indiana, you're going to blow everyone away, but do you ever know a guy named Bobby Knight? And I said, yeah, I mean, I don't know him, but he called me about a year ago, and he really wanted me to run.
He said, well, if you could ever get Bobby Knight's endorsement, you would absolutely seal the great state of Indiana. So I'm at my desk. And I have these stacks -- and, honestly, there are thousands of pages. It's -- I can't even tell you. I have this massive desk, because it keeps a lot of stuff. And there are just thousands of pages.
And I said, I hung up, I said, let me see if I can find his number. I remember I wrote it down, I put it over here. Let me just see if I can find his number. And I go over here, and I take stack number one, which is literally two or three feet up in the air. Pages, thousands. And I go, let me see. And I lift it in the middle.
And there's this little index card, and it says "Bobby Knight" and the phone number. It's the weirdest thing. It's the weirdest thing. And then I look up and I say, thank you, God, thank you. That was from -- that was from God. Because it's amazing. I didn't look, I didn't like thumb through -- I just lifted it up and there it was.
It was the craziest thing. Anyway, I called up Bobby Knight, ding, ding, ding. He picks up. I go, Bobby? He says, I've been waiting for you to call. And that was the beginning of a great romance. It really was. He is a tough cookie. And you know what? I just took out something. I said, let me -- you know, look, we all know he's a great coach.
But we didn't even know how great a coach. Bobby Knight, as you know, he coached in a place called Indiana. I won't ask you how it's doing since he left. I won't ask. But it's going to do well, and I hear you have a very good coach. I do. I hear you have a very good coach now. Is that true? I hear you have a very good coach.
But he coached the U.S. Olympic team in 1984, won the gold medal. He won three NCAA titles at a place called the University of Indiana. He was put in the Hall of Fame in 1991. Bobby Knight was the last coach to have an undefeated season. And that surprises me. Is that true? That surprises me. And I asked Bobby, I just asked him, I said, you know, why is that?
How come -- you think with all your -- you have some of these teams, they're great, the guys leave as freshmen, they go, they play in the NBA, and they're great. Why? He said, no, you play so many games, you know, 30, 32 games, you go into the playoffs. He said, if one guy has a little bit of a cold hand, you lose a game, or if one guy has a hot hand for a good team, you could lose the game.
You know, you play a lot of games, because that surprised me. The last coach to have an undefeated team. And, by the way, I told Bobby, if you want, if you want, Bobby, this has nothing to do with politics, but it's interesting, because I think most of you people like sports. And most of you people -- you're Indiana.
You like basketball. I said, if you want, you can tell the Larry Bird story. Because it's a great story. I like Larry Bird. I don't know if he likes me, but I don't really care. I think Larry Bird was a great basketball player. Do we agree? I think we agree. But he has a great Larry Bird story. But listen to this.
Bobby Knight won 902 games. He's third all time. This guy -- and I'll tell you, he could have gone years longer. He could have gone years longer. He is a tremendous guy. But he was with me before I started. You understand. He was with me literally right from the beginning. And I'd like to ask the great Bobby Knight to come up. Thank you.
I want to thank all you people from Indiana, because we won a hell of a lot of games with Indiana playing. You know, there was a great president many years ago, Harry Truman. The American public got a little thing to let him know how much they appreciated it. It was something called, like, give 'em hell, Harry.
Give 'em hell, Harry. And I'd like you to join with me in saying something -- oh, he's already given 'em hell. I got it. I want you to join me in saying something else. Just like they said it to Harry Truman, who was a great president, and so is he. And what I want you to say is very simply this: Go get 'em, Donald!
One, two, go get 'em, Donald. [Audience Calls out Go get 'em Donald] Three! Go get 'em, Donald! [Audience Calls out Go get 'em Donald] One thing -- one thing I would have done, it takes great defense to win in basketball, great defense. I think I would had to wait on Donald for a little while until he became a great defender.
And that's what he's been. He's been a great defender of the United States of America. [Audience chants USA]
What a great guy. What a great guy. Winner. He's a winner. We like winners, right? Governor, we like winners. Well, that's special. You know, don't tell Bobby, but he left his pad up here and his pen. I'm going to keep it, because I can sell it for a lot of money. Thank you. Thank you very much. A lot of love, a lot of love in this room.
A lot of love in this state. We are honored to be joined tonight by many terrific Indiana Republicans, including a man who has done an incredible job, and it's not easy to follow Mike Pence. Governor Eric Holcomb, you have done a great job, Governor, thank you. Thank you. Great job. Great job, Eric. And a congressman who I've gotten to know, and he has a great style.
He is a gentleman. He's a champion. Todd Rokita, he's here. Where is Todd? Where is he? Thanks, Todd. Great job, Todd, thank you. Thank you. And with us tonight are two terrific Republican candidates. Please get them in office. Please go out and vote. They're terrific. Jim Baird and Greg Pence. Does anybody know Greg Pence?
Thanks, thanks. Thank you, fellas. Thanks, Greg. They have good genes in the Pence family, don't they? If you don't want to be saying the words "Speaker Pelosi" for the next two years... you've got to go out and vote for Greg and Jim and a Republican Congress. We need it. It's going to be a very interesting day.
Tuesday is going to be a very interesting day. They're not going to beat the day from two years ago, but it's going to be interesting nevertheless. Was that a great time we had two years ago? Finally, I'm proud to introduce the next United States senator. I'll tell you, before I do, before I bring him up, I just want to say that Mike Braun is not a career politician.
He's a very successful businessman and a patriarch who will fight every single day of his life for the people of Indiana. He's a fighter. He's a winner. Very successful guy. He's a very successful guy. He didn't need this. I didn't need it, either, by the way. But we're having fun. You know why? We're winning, we're winning.
Mike Braun is tough on crime, great on jobs, and he will always support our wonderful vets, our military, and our law enforcement, our police. And a vote for Mike's opponent, Joe Donnelly, is a vote to make cryin' Chuck Schumer the Senate majority leader. We can't do that. Can't do that. A vote for any Democrat this November is a vote to put the radical Democrats in charge of the House, the Senate, and every congressional committee.
That's not good for Indiana. It's not good for our country. And according to the Center for Effective Lawmaking -- listen to this. You have to listen to this. This is very important. Joe Donnelly has been rated the least effective Democrat in the United States Senate. Think of that. Rated the least -- the least effective.
And that's why they call him sleepin' Joe. You got to get out -- just get out and vote. We don't have to do this. Just get out and vote. Joe Donnelly voted against your tax cuts. And he joined the Democrat mob to vote against Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And no man, nobody, was ever abused like then-Judge Kavanaugh.
Nobody was ever abused. What they did to him, what the Democrats did to him, is a disgrace, but he's going to be on the bench. Now he's going to be the United States Supreme Court along with Justice Gorsuch for many, many years. Donnelly voted to get free welfare to illegals. And he joined every single other Senate Democrat to sponsor Dianne Feinstein's open border bill.
You remember her, right? The people of Indiana do not have a one-week memory cycle. In fact, the people of Indiana have about a 60-year memory cycle. Dianne -- remember that? Was that horrible? Were you leaking -- did you leak it? Right? John Kiernan -- John Cornyn said, did you leak it? No, no. No, no. I don't think so. Did we leak it? No, you didn't leak it. Oh, no, no, we didn't leak it. That was the worst body language.
John Cornyn. One simple question, did you leak it? And she choked. No, no, no, I don't think so. Oh. In other words, she leaked it, right? She leaked it. She leaked it. But that was a disgrace, what we watched up there. Right? What we watched up there. It's no surprise that Joe Donnelly is holding a rally this weekend with Barack H. Obama.
Barack Obama. I watched him speak today. He had a very small crowd. They don't talk about that. And they never talk about how big are crowds are. Never. I always say, when I get home to our first lady, Melania, who's great. You think... She's good. People love our first lady. And you think it's easy to be first lady when you're married to me? You think it's easy?
People love our first lady. And I always say, honey, let me ask you, how did the crowd look tonight? They didn't show it. I said, oh. But she said -- but the sound is amazing. But the sound. You know, like in Houston, we had 22,000 people in an arena, thousands outside for Ted Cruz. He's doing well. You don't hear about it anymore, right?
Remember? He was in a little trouble. We had the rally. You haven't heard that anymore. He's doing great. They're all doing great! Mike Braun is doing great. Mike Braun is doing great. In fact, maybe what I'll do is I'll ask the media to turn that camera and show them this room, please. Would you do that?
They don't want to do that. They don't want to do that. [Audience Chants USA] They don't like to turn the camera. You know, when I first started, we had big crowds. Just like center stage, we had big crowds right from the beginning. When I first started, I thought that the cameras were like fixed, they couldn't turn, you know?
Because it's like modern equipment and maybe it can't turn because it's got so much stuff and who knows, and they would never turn it. And then we had a couple of people that were a little noisy, you know? They caused a little problem, and they were back in, like a corner, and that camera turned like a pretzel.
And that's when I realized.... Because they wanted to make us look bad. And when they had a little bit of a problem, in a little corner of the room, that sucker, I've never seen a camera turned at that angle, upside down and backwards. Upside down. Oh, what they can do with that modern equipment. And I went for four rallies, and I said, the reason is the cameras cannot turn.
We were wrong. So Obama gave a rally in front of a very small group of people today. And in the rally, he talked about honesty, how he has to be honest. But he talked about you can have your plan, you can have your doctor. How many times did he say that? Twenty-eight times. Right? He doesn't talk about that.
And we could go into it. But let's stay pleasant, right? Let's stay pleasant. Because we don't want to go back to the Obama days of low wages, high unemployment, rising crime, open borders, far left judges, oppressive regulations, horrible, horrible, horrible trade deals, disastrous foreign policy. Look at the mess I inherited in North Korea, and look at how well we're doing now.
And terrible health care. If you want prosperity for your family, safety for your children, and security for your country, vote for Mike Braun. Mike, come on up. Mike Braun. Come on up, Mike.
So, never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd be on a stage with the president of the United States, the VP, and Bobby Knight. How can it get any better? Only in America, only in Indiana. When I decided to do this, 14-and-a-half months ago... [Audience member calls out I love you Donald] I -- I never would have done it, would not have wasted my time if this man did not do what he did. My wife and family are right over there, but I'll never forget the night.
I did turn the TV off at a quarter after two. I thought it might go later, went to bed, I'd only get five to six hours of sleep. That's all I need, not as good as the president here. I know he gets by on less. But I'll never remember -- forget getting up that next morning and when I saw on the TV, President-elect Trump... That's the reason I'm here.
If it hadn't happened, I'd be hunkered down in Southern Indiana wondering how to survive. Thank goodness. So my opponent, who calls himself the hired help, I think you need to do more than that to deserve to be re-elected. [Audience member calls out We love you, Mike] Thank you. He's the least effective Democratic senator.
Sounds like the tired help. He -- he -- he takes all his marching orders from Chuck Schumer. Let's make him the fired help. Let's retire Joe Donnelly. Thank you.
Thank you, Mike. Very successful guy. Did a great job, and this is what he wants to do, and he's going to be very successful at doing what you want to do, which is a lot of great things. So I just want to thank you. And, Mike, we want to thank you for doing this, because it's not easy. It's not easy. Thank you, Mike.
If Democrats get the majority, one of their first projects will be the socialist takeover of American health care. The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than 360,000 Indiana seniors, who totally depend on it. Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and, frankly, have paid for it. And Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
Democrats' plan to destroy health care also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants. I'm sure you don't mind. Does anybody mind? Nobody minds, right? As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to violate our laws, overrun our borders, and totally bankrupt our country.
Because that's what's going to end up. They want to sign illegal aliens up for free health care, free welfare, free education. But what do they really want? They want them to vote, because they're going to vote for the Democrat. Illegal immigration costs American taxpayers more than $100 billion every single year, more than three times the entire state budget of Indiana.
We need to use our precious resources to help our fellow Americans who respect our laws, not illegal caravans who break into our borders and break our laws. Democrat immigration policies not only drain our treasury, but they threaten our communities. Nearly 100 percent of heroin in the United States enters through the southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of the cocaine, the majority of meth, and a substantial portion of the ultra-lethal fentanyl, killing our youth all over our country.
These drugs destroy the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans, and 70,000 Americans every year die from these drugs. Last year alone, our brave ICE officers arrested -- listen to this number -- more than 127,000 criminal aliens. And they want to get rid of ICE. Can you imagine? Yet Democrats want to abolish ICE.
They want to get rid of ICE. These are great patriots. These are great people. These are people that do a job that nobody in this room wants to do. I don't want to do it. How about you? This guy could do it, I think. But there aren't too many. They want to turn America into a giant sanctuary for violent predators and MS-13 killers.
A blue wave would equal a crime wave. Very simple. And a red wave equals jobs and security. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, and law enforcement. Border security is also a woman's issue.
Women want safe neighborhoods for their families, great schools, and health care for their children, and they want criminals to be thrown in jail or thrown the hell out of our country. Remember during the election -- my election, '16 -- they were saying, well, I don't think he's going to do well with women.
Women, women, women! I love women! They're the greatest! I like 'em much more than I like the men! But I love -- and here's the thing. And then, remember, after we won, they were said -- they said -- came in -- oh, they were so -- oh, they were just -- they didn't know what was going on. They were devastated.
They said he did unbelievably well with women. What happened, women? And now they're saying the same thing. They're saying, ah, but they say it weakly, you know, because they want to say it quickly, get it over with. Uh, I don't think he'll do well with women. But we tried this one two years ago. That didn't work out too well.
We did so well. And we're going to do well with women again. Because they do want security. They want security. They don't want these people coming in to our country. You saw the report that was put out. In the caravan, more than 300 people have criminal records and have serious problems that we don't want to get involved with, folks.
And we want people coming in, but they have to come in legally. I'm sorry. This election is about security, and this election is about prosperity. For years, you watched as we let foreign countries plunder our wealth, shutter our factories, and steal our jobs. But those days, if you haven't noticed, are over.
We have added half-a-million manufacturing jobs since the election, soon to go to 600,000, including 32,000 manufacturing jobs in just the last month. And do you remember the previous administration? We're not going to get manufacturing jobs anymore. I said, really? Tell that -- tell that to your great governor.
Tell that to your great governor, right? You're getting them here, Governor, aren't you, huh? And these are the great jobs. These are great jobs. High-paying jobs, talented jobs, talented people. I recently announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal, one of the worst trade deals, with an incredible, brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.
The USMCA is a giant victory for Indiana farmers, manufacturers, and dairy producers. You know how good it is. Great. It's great. And every time they said no, I said that's OK, we'll just tariff your cars coming in. They said, OK, we'll give you that point. We have taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's very abusive trade practices.
And I spoke to President Xi today. They want to make a deal, but we have to have a fair deal. We have to have a deal that's fair for the United States. And China has to open up their borders for our companies. By the way, America is being respected again. Do you notice? America is being respected again. But every day with us, it's promises made, promises kept.
And actually, we made a lot of promises, but we did a lot better than those promises. We have actually performed a lot better than even the promises we made. We have taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. You're going to see that. You've already seen it. To help critically ill patients get life-saving treatments, we passed something that they've been trying to pass for many decades.
It's called right to try, where they can try our drugs that are looking promising that are in our pipeline, right? Hopefully you don't have to worry about that. Hopefully there's nobody in this room that's going to have to worry about that. But it's a great thing for people. And by the way, some incredible stories, some incredible results already.
After years of surging premiums, the cost of health care is finally coming down. And you see that. And by the way, we got rid of the mandate. Right? We got rid of the individual mandate, folks, the most unpopular part. And we've decimated Obamacare. And now we're managing it properly, and your premiums aren't going up nearly as fast, but getting rid of the individual mandate.
So many people have thanked me. You had the privilege of paying a fortune in order to have the privilege of not having to pay a fortune for bad health care. Right? Not too good. Not too good. Not too good. It's gone. You don't have to pay not to have health care. Think of it. You're paying not to have health care.
Great. Great. And last month, I proudly signed the largest bill to fight the opioid epidemic in American history. We passed veterans choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor, and the landmark accountability law for the veterans to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans can be accountable.
And immediately we look at that person and we say, you're fired. Get out of here. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military. And we gave our great warriors their largest pay raise in more than a decade. And they deserve it. And on my direction, and working with Mike Pence, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces called the Space Force.
Very much needed. Very much needed. That's where it's at. That's where it's all going. Defense, offense, that's where it's all going. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. And just today, we announced that we are re-imposing all sanctions lifted under that ridiculous deal that should have never been signed in the first place.
We will have in place the toughest ever sanctions on this brutal Iranian regime. And at some point, they're going to get very smart and they're going to come back and negotiate a real deal, a fair deal, and a deal that lets them thrive. We want them to thrive. We have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
Together, we have made extraordinary progress, and we are just getting started. But the Democrats want to turn back the clock, put America in reverse, and give power back to a corrupt, selfish ruling class that only looks out for themselves. I know them well. But we are not going back. We're not going back.
We're going forward. I need you to vote for a Republican House and a Republican Senate so we can continue this incredible movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country. It is. And if it wasn't, and I said that, I'd have a lot of problems back there. It is the greatest movement in the history -- think of it. And it's about you.
It's not about me. It's about you. Although I didn't do a bad job, right? Not bad. Not a bad job. It's about you. He says, keep winning. We're going to keep winning. This is a movement built on love for our nation and love for our fellow citizen. And with your votes, we will keep on cutting your taxes, reducing your regulations, and raising your incomes.
We will protect Medicare and Social Security. And you remember on the debate stage, I would always defend Social Security, when other guys wanted to tear it apart. Well, guess what? We haven't touched Social Security. We will defend your right to free speech, religious liberty, and we will continue to confirm judges who will interpret the Constitution as written.
We will fully secure the border, we will pass Kate's law, we will stop sanctuary cities, stop catch-and-release, end the visa lottery, end chain migration, and we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists the hell out of our country. We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity.
For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. You know it well. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and I always will. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Indiana. And we are proudly standing up for our great national anthem. I am asking every citizen from every party and every background and every race and color and creed for your support so we can continue to deliver hope, opportunity, and justice for all Americans.
I need you to get your family, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and go out and vote Republican. This Tuesday, I need the people of Indiana to send a message to Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, and the radical Democrats by voting for Mike Braun. He will be a winner. He will be a winner.
Remember, your senator that you currently have, sleepin' Joe, last -- he was last on the list. Last! He was last on the list. Remember that when you walk into the booth. I'm really speaking more to the television cameras than to you, because I don't think we have too many Donnelly voters. Anybody going to vote for Donnelly in this room?
I don't know. Not too many. Not too many, Governor. I don't see any. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people. This great state was built by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk the face of the Earth.
These proud Indiana patriots braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home with their own two hands. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families. You know that. You do know that. They love their families.
What else do they love? They love their country. And they loved their God. These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, their sweat, and their tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud American heritage. That's what it is. It's a proud American heritage.
For the sake of our freedom, and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend, we will not break, we will never give in, we will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory.
Always. Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And Indiana, together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and will make America great again. Thank you, Indiana.
Thank you.
Hello, Johnson City. It is great to be with you. I am thrilled to be back. I look forward to being back in the great state of Tennessee, with thousands of hard-working American patriots. That's what you are. In less than two years, we've achieved the biggest comeback in American history. You look at what's happened.
And our country is respected again. We're respected again. Jobless claims are at a 50-year low. And the stock market is at an all-time high. The economy is booming, wages are rising, and more Americans are working today than ever before. Ever before. And think of that. Think of that. Such a simple statement.
But such a complex thing to do. Think of it. More Americans are working today than ever before. What a beautiful statement. Get out and vote in November. It can all change around quickly, folks. We are defending our Second Amendment, taking care... But Bredesen will not defend your Second Amendment. We're taking care of our great veterans and rebuilding America's military might.
And just today, we made history again when I announced to the world that we are replacing the job-killing disaster known as NAFTA... with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada -- we added Canada, worked out great -- trade agreement. And we're calling it USMCA. No more NAFTA. No more NAFTA. It's the largest trade deal the United States has ever negotiated.
And it's also a great deal for our country. It's going to produce jobs. And companies aren't going to be leaving and firing everybody and making product and sending it back into the United States, no tax. It's there. It's modern. And it's balanced. And you know what? We have two wonderful partners now. Now they're partners, Mexico and Canada, and that's a good thing.
That's a good thing. America's winning again, and America is being respected again, because we are finally putting America first. But radical Democrats in Congress are trying very hard to erase everything that we've achieved. They're looking out there right now and they're trying to figure out, how do they take an election because they want to take it back?
You look at your 401(k)s. You know, we're up from the time of the election 55 percent.
I love you, President Trump!
I love you, too. He doesn't sound like my type. You know, that voice is very strong. But I love him. Whoever you are, I love you. We're just five weeks from one of the most important congressional elections of our lifetime. They're trying to take what we did in '16, something that nobody has seen maybe in other countries, not alone -- it was the greatest election victory in the history of our country.
And between the Democrats, who are obstructionists, who are people that don't want to see strong military, they don't want borders, they don't mind crime... and their enablers, the fake news media, right back there. We've got to be very careful. We've got to be very careful. A Democrat takeover of Congress will plunge our country into gridlock and chaos and take away all of the wealth that you've earned over the last 20 months.
This -- and think of this. The stock market, which is up at record levels, and now the highest, will drop. Your 401(k)s will be devastated. Your taxes will rise beyond your wildest imagination. And crime will flow in to our country through these open borders. Other than that, we'll be doing very well. It's crazy.
[Audience chants Built the wall]
And we are. We want to get more money. We want to -- I could build that thing in one year. I could build it. We got $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and another $1.6 billion. We want to build it fast. I can build it -- so after the election, leadership has said, meaning Republicans, they're going to do something that's going to be very strong.
Let's see what happens. But -- but the wall is under construction. A lot of work has been done. A lot of renovation -- if you look at some of it, some wall was up, falling down, terrible condition, now it's beautiful, brand new, and it works. It does work. We need wall. We need border security. We want -- we got to take care of our people.
Look at what's going on. Look at what's going on in California. You have a man running for governor in California that says we don't want any borders. We don't want ICE. We do want sanctuary cities. And they're going to take care of health care, they're going to take care of education, they're going to care of everything for people that just flow in. You're going to have a billion people living in California.
It's going to be a mess. We have it right. We have it going properly. This country will never be Venezuela, that I can tell you, because that's what they're looking for. That's what they're looking for. The Democrat Party has been completely taken over by the so-called resistance. That's all they do. They campaign on resist.
I'll tell you something. They're only good at one thing. They stick together like glue. That's it. They have bad policy. Frankly, they're bad politicians. Everything's bad. But they stick together. We have to be very careful, they'll take everything, including your Second Amendment. They'll take everything away.
Democrats believe that they're entitled to power, and they have been blind in a blind rage ever since, boy, they lost the 2016 -- they've gone loco. They have gone loco. They have gone crazy. This election is a choice between a Republican Party that is building our future and a Democrat Party that is trying to burn our future down.
The Democrats only know how to obstruct, demolish, and destroy. As we've seen in recent weeks, Democrats are willing to do anything and to hurt anyone to get their way, like they're doing with Judge Kavanaugh. They've been trying to destroy him since the very first second he was announced, because they know that Judge Kavanaugh will follow the Constitution as written.
That's been his history. And he's a good man. Great student, great intellect. Never had a problem. All of a sudden, oh, let's go back to high school. They maybe should go before high school. And I know so many of them. You have the great Vietnam War hero who didn't go to Vietnam -- you know that, right -- Blumenthal.
How about Blumenthal? How about Blumenthal? Da Nang Blumenthal, we call him Da Nang Blumenthal. For 15 years, as the attorney general of Connecticut, he went around telling war stories. People dying left and right, but my platoon marched forward. He was never in Vietnam. It was a lie. And then he's up there -- then he's up there saying we want the truth from Judge Kavanaugh.
And you're getting the truth from Judge Kavanaugh. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Da Nang. You know Da Nang, right? Great city in Vietnam. And then you have Cory Booker, who destroyed Newark. I mean, the job he did in Newark. And see some of the things he wrote when he was young about women. Take a look, OK? And then they want to take a lot longer with the FBI.
No, the FBI -- they should take -- by the way, if we took 10 years, they'd want more time. But they want to take a lot longer. But Dianne Feinstein, she had this... She had this letter for months, and she didn't reveal it until everything was finished. Then she revealed it. Then she says, oh, we want more time.
Let's see how it all works out. But I'll tell you what, they're trying to destroy a very fine person. And we can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. Democrats want activist, left-wing judges who will totally rewrite your laws, erase your borders, and replace your values. You don't want that in Tennessee.
Republicans know that a judge's job is to follow the law and to deliver equal justice for all. The Democrats can no longer be trusted with your power and with their power. You can't let it happen. They have moved so far left that Pocahontas is considered a conservative. True. That's right. Elizabeth Warren.
She said she's considering a run for the presidency. Please, please run. How about that group, Biden? Biden. We call him 1 percent Biden. Until Obama took him off the trash heap, he couldn't do anything. Now he's talking about running. Tough guy. He's tough guy. He's -- he's a real genius. I want to challenge him to a fight behind the barn.
Oh, would I love that? Wouldn't that be good? I want to challenge Donald Trump. Remember that? He got a little upset. He's another beauty. They got some real beauties going. This November 6th, you have the chance to reject the outrageous policies of the Democrat Party. Not the Democratic Party. But the Democrat Party.
Sounds worse, right? But that's their real name. It's the Democrat Party. But you can only do it. You got to vote for Republican. We need more Republicans to get the votes. Stop the crime. You know, I said the other night, and I said, you know, I think I'm going to keep it. It's a little harsh, but I think I'll keep it. Democrats are the party of crime.
How does that sound? They're the party of crime. Sounds a little tough, but it's true. Open borders. We're thrilled to be joined by many terrific Republican members of Congress, people that are friends of mine, people that have helped me, people that love your state and they love other states and they love our country.
One of them is a man that everybody knows in this state very well. His name is Phil Roe. And he has really helped. Phil? Thank you, Phil. He's always there for you. Thank you, Phil. Another man said -- this is what I was Mr. Trump, not Mr. President -- I was here, he said, you know, we do early voting in Tennessee.
He said, sir, I want to tell you that people are coming out of the mountains, out of the rivers, out of -- they're coming out of the valleys. They're coming -- they said -- right? They're coming out of everywhere. He said, I've never seen anything. I've been doing this stuff for 30 years more. And he said, this is what before -- you know, I'm waiting like we had, like, 30 days, but you have early voting in Tennessee.
So I've never seen anything like it. People that haven't voted, because they haven't liked anybody. These are great people. These are great, incredible people. But they didn't exactly like what they had to go for. So they have a -- now they're coming out with Trump banners, Trump hats, Trump -- you know, make America great again.
And this man -- he said, I can't speak for the rest of our nation, but if the nation's like Tennessee, you're going to win by a lot. And that's exactly what happened, right? John Duncan, Congressman, thank you, John. Where's John? Good. Thank you, John. He made me feel very good before the election. A friend of mine, a great congressman, somebody who's really worked hard.
Even though he's not from your state, does it matter? He's just a great congressman. I see him here. He has been so strong, so smart. He loves this country so much, Congressman Mark Meadows. Thank you, Mark. And Deborah. Deborah, thank you, Deb. Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, who has been fantastic. Where's Chuck?
Chuck? Thank you, Chuck. Chuck has been great. Morgan Griffith, Scott DesJarlais -- my favorite name in politics. DesJarlais. Thank you, fellas. Thank you. You guys are great. These are really -- these are great people. You know, we don't have to devote a lot of time. I'm just -- these are great people. These are people that love our country.
They want to do the right thing. You know, there's nothing wrong with having strong borders, strong law enforcement. You want to be safe. There's nothing wrong with paying low taxes. There's really nothing wrong. You want to have a strong military, especially in these times. You know, if you have a strong military, you're never going to have to use it. You're never going to have to use it. And we're going to very shortly have the strongest military we've ever had.
We're also joined -- thank you, all -- we're also joined by future Republican members of Congress, Tim Burchett. Where's Tim? Tim? We got to get Tim in there. Tim? Thank you, Tim. John Rose, John, thank you, John. Mark Green, I hear they're up pretty good, but don't take any chances. Don't take any chances.
You've got to go vote. Don't take any chances. We've got to get them in. But they're up pretty good. This is a hell of a state, I'll tell you that. These people... I also want to thank your great governor. I had dinner with him the other night. We were with a group of people. It was a fascinating dinner.
He loves this state, also, and he's done a great job as governor, Governor Bill Haslam. Thank you. Thank you, Bill. Thank you. And Lieutenant Governor Randy McNally, thank you. Thank you, Randy. Great. Great job. Thank you. Great job. And very importantly, we have Tennessee's next governor, Bill Lee. And a man who did a fantastic job during the election for Trump.
I will tell you, State Party Chairman Scott Golden. Thank you, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks. And, finally, the person we are here tonight to support. We cherish this person. She's a fighter. A true fighter for the people of Tennessee. She loves your state. And she's your next U.S. senator, she's going to be fantastic, Marsha Blackburn, Marsha, come up, please.
There we go. Thank you all so much. [Audience Chants Marsha] Thank you. Mr. President, thank you for coming back to Tennessee. We love the president in Tennessee. And I want to say thank you to each of you for being here tonight. Thank you so much for all you are doing to elect all of these Republican candidates that we've talked about tonight.
And thank you for sending Donald J. Trump to the White House. He has had an amazing 20 months. You've just heard some of those things. Not to even mention the foreign policy that he has achieved. Dealing with China, North Korea, getting us out of the Iran deal. And, Mr. President, we in Tennessee really appreciate that you moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
Thank you for that. I know -- I know that the Democrats keep saying that there is a blue wave coming, but let me tell you something... Mr. President, when that blue wave gets to the state line, it is going to run smack dab into the great red wall. And that... And that is every single one of you. So if you want a U.S. senator who is going to stand with the president, build the wall, cut your taxes, and to make certain that we take care of our men and women in uniform, I am asking you to stand with me. Let's -- let's take these Tennessee values to Washington, D.C., and put them to work with President Donald Trump.
Thank you all. [Audience chants Marsha]
So I just want to thank Marsha Blackburn. And I will you, she's all about Tennessee values. That's the one. She's got Tennessee values. A vote for Marsha is really a vote for me and everything that we stand for. It's a vote for make America great again. That's what it is. A vote for Bredesen is a vote for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi... and the real leader of the Democrats, Maxine Waters.
Phil Bredesen wants to raise your taxes. As governor, remember this -- you've got to remember -- seems like a nice guy, but what good does that do? As governor, he raised taxes and fees in your state by more than $1 billion. He opposes the border wall totally. He supported driver certificates for illegal aliens.
And on his watch, Tennessee unemployment doubled. It doubled in the -- whatever it was. How long was he there? Eight? It doubled. You want him to be running -- I don't think so. I don't think so. He doubled unemployment. In 2010, Phil wrote a book advocating government-run health care. That's what you want?
You want to wait on line for about six weeks to get taken care of? And called for it to be funded by a 20 percent payroll tax on all of the hard-working Americans, many are in this room right now. Government-run health care. No, I don't think so. That hasn't proven too successful anywhere else. Phil was a major financial supporter of President Obama and of Hillary -- crooked Hillary Clinton.
She's crooked as hell. Now Phil is running to be the 51st Senate Democrat and the 51st -- Democrats are elected in November, then Chuck Schumer will become a majority leader. You put in 51. Even though he said something good about our deal with Canada and Mexico today, but how can you not say good? That's why Schumer is so desperate for Phil to win, because everything that we stand for will never get the votes.
We need votes. It's very important. Number one, Marsha will be a great, great senator, but, number two, we need the votes. We've got to have the vote. And he will never once vote for us. Just remember, he will never vote for us. Not on judges. You know, one of the reasons they say I got elected was that Supreme Court judge -- they always say the single most important thing that the president can do is the selection of a Supreme Court judge.
OK. So we picked Justice Neil Gorsuch, who has been fantastic. And now Judge Brett Kavanaugh is actually doing well. I really believe -- we've got to do it. We cannot allow ourselves... to be pushed around. Phil is only running because Chuck Schumer called him up and begged him. The word is begged him to run because Schumer knows the Democrats' path to power runs right through Tennessee.
Again, Second Amendment, higher taxes, lots of crime, MS-13, get used to them. No ICE. We don't want ICE, they say. If you want to stop Schumer from becoming majority leader, if you want to stop your taxes from going up 50 percent or more -- that's what's going to happen -- then you must vote against Bredesen.
Your vote in this election will decide which party controls the Senate. That's how close it is. You know, I'd like to tell you no, but that's how close it is. A Democrat-controlled Senate will always be raising your taxes. They'll always throw open your border. There's nothing you can do. There's nothing he's going to do to change it. He's going to vote with the Democrats.
There's not going to be -- I mean, you look at health care. We got no votes. Look at -- we gave you the largest tax cuts in the history of this country. We didn't get one Democrat vote. And they don't vote for a reason. They just vote because it's bad for Trump. In other words, they want to stop anything that we do. If it's really good, they still want to stop it. And we don't want to let that happen.
We have unbelievable things planned, and we have to let it happen. Flood your streets. They're going to flood your streets with criminal aliens. That's what's going to happen.
We love you!
They're always attacking law enforcement. I'll give you an example. Under the Obama administration, we have tremendous amounts of surplus military equipment. Right? Tremendous equipment. You know, heavy armor, lots of different things, that keep the law enforcement professionals, people that we love, that keeps them safe.
They didn't want to give it them. I have given it to them. I'm sorry. They want to block your great judges. They want to weaken the military. They don't -- it's not even weaken. They don't want to spend any money on the military. You know, the beautiful thing about military -- number one, you need it. Everything's like jobs, jobs is very important to me. When it comes to the military, it's not the jobs.
OK? That's totally secondary. But we will soon have the strongest military that we've ever had. We had fighter jets -- we had fighter jets and we had airplanes in our military where the father flew 'em, the grandfather flew 'em, and the son as a young pilot goes in, flying the same planes. You know what?
They're all going fast. We've ordered all incredible new, finest jets in the world. But the other thing is, they're made right here in the USA. All of them. Jobs, jobs, jobs. They want to outlaw private health insurance. So you'll get great health insurance, and we're already doing it. We're providing you with tremendous amounts of competition.
You're getting great health insurance and it's going to get better when we can get a few more votes so we can do it the way you want it. This is the way you want it. They want to shut down American energy and replace freedom with socialism. They want... They want to turn -- it's true -- the Democrats want to turn America into Venezuela.
That'll be wonderful. That'll be wonderful. We're not going to let it happen. And you know what, even most Democrats -- I can't believe -- when you look at what they're doing with sanctuary cities and everything, I can't believe most of them are going for it. Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats in Washington want to raid Medicare to pay for their socialism.
Democrats are pushing so-called medicine for all, robbing our seniors of all of their Medicare benefits. That's what's happening. Republicans want to protect Medicare and our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it. And we always protect Americans with their pre-existing conditions. We're doing that.
On pre-existing conditions, a lot of people think it's not a very Republican thing. It is now, and it has been for me. I want to take care of people with pre-existing conditions. We're doing well. We can do it. Democrats also want to give welfare and free health care to illegal aliens. Republicans want to protect public benefits.
And we do. We want to protect benefits and public benefits for truly needy Americans, Americans that need help. Democrats want to abolish ICE. In other words, they want to abolish immigration enforcement entirely. And the Democrat Party supports sanctuary cities that unleash violent predators, like MS-13, into our communities.
And remember what I said. It's the party of crime. Democrats -- they really are. You look at what they're doing. Even look at what they're doing in Congress. Even look at what they're doing with our laws, the way they treat our laws, the way they treat country. What they do in Congress. They are indeed the party of crime.
Every day, innocent lives are stolen because of Democrat-supported immigrant policies. If you just take a look, you have immigration policies that are so bad, so dangerous. Just recently in California, an illegal alien with a sex crime conviction and other convictions had a prior deportation. They wanted to deport this person.
They never did. He was convicted for killing a local football coach who leaves behind a wife and six beautiful kids. A pillar of the community. By the way, this is all over. You could go -- you could do this for days. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.
And Republicans proudly stand with the brave men and women of ICE, Border Patrol, and we stand with law enforcement. This election in November is about safety, and it's also about prosperity. The prosperity of our country. We are doing things now that nobody believes. We are hitting numbers that nobody believes.
Here are just some of our achievements since Election Day. Thank you. We've created over 4 million new jobs. Nobody thought that was possible, 4 million. And lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. We've added nearly 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. That wasn't supposed to happen. Remember when President Obama said you can't do manufacturing?
Magic wand, right? You'd need a magic wand. You don't need a magic wand. You need proper policies. You need a lot of things. You don't need a magic wand. Remember this. And you've heard me say it a lot. I'm very proud of it. African-American unemployment -- think of it -- African-American unemployment just reached the lowest level ever recorded.
Right? Right? Right? After years of Democrats failing and abandoning African-Americans, Republicans are delivering for African-Americans like never before. We're doing the job. And you saw that the other night with Kanye West. How good was Kanye West? And Big Jim Brown. And so many others. We're supported by so many great folks.
Jim Brown. Boy, we could use him on some of those teams right now, couldn't we? Couldn't we? Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment also reached all-time lows. Women's unemployment recently reached its lowest level in 65 years. That's going to be coming out soon. I think it'll be in history. And last week, I signed a groundbreaking new trade deal with South Korea that dramatically increases American exports.
You remember that deal? Remember that deal? Hillary Clinton -- that was a Hillary deal -- she said we must have this deal with South Korea. It will create 250,000 jobs. And it did for South Korea, not for us. It created jobs for South Korea. We now have a good thing. Friend or foe? Friend or foe? Friend, OK. You never know.
When you hear little noises like that, you say foe, get them out, right? But they're friends. We only have friends in Tennessee, I think. We're also entering new trade talks with the European Union, which, frankly, has treated us extremely badly, and with Japan. Japan sends us millions and millions of cars.
And we're working on a trade deal. We're working on a trade deal. It will be fine. And we are cracking down on China's unfair and abusive trade practices. Got to do it. We've been losing $300 billion, $400 billion, $500 billion a year to China. No more. No more. Right. No more. Can't do it. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation.
And we're doing it with American aluminum and we're doing it with American steel. And our steel is doing really well. Really well. To put more money in the pockets of Tennessee families, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in the history of our country. And we eliminated the core of Obamacare.
We got rid of the individual mandate. It's gone. The worst part of our (inaudible) And as bad as those premiums are, we've kept the premiums down. We've done a lot of things. But we're trying to keep those premiums from the remnant of Obamacare down. But it will all get taken care of. We just need a few more votes.
This year alone, we have successfully lowered your health insurance premiums in the state of Tennessee by 26 percent. That's not bad. Under the past administration, it was like a rocket ship going up. To help critically ill patients access life-saving treatments, we just passed something they've been trying to pass for 45 years.
Right to try. You know what that is. Right to try. Right? I'm very proud -- Meadows helped with that one. And Phil helped with that one, right, Phil? Phil Roe. You guys all helped with that one. And Greg, right, Greg was good. Did a good job. You know, right to try, so somebody's terminally ill, and we have medicines that have great help, great future.
They look good. They're very promising. But we had no right to give those medicines to somebody that's terminal, is going to die. They had no hope. If they had money, they traveled all over the world to find a cure, but yet we have the greatest doctors and the greatest medicine in the world here. But it would be years, three years, four years.
We've reduced it. It used to be 14, 15 years. I think we have it down to three-and-a-half to four. Scott is doing a great job at the FDA. But... Forty-five years they've been trying to pass -- not as easy as it sounds. Not as easy as -- I will tell you, not that easy, but we got it passed. So now somebody's terminally ill.
And if we have a drug that looks like it's possibly going to help, we can actually give it to those people. And you know what? Already we've had success. Some of these drugs are working. Some of these drugs are working. I'm very proud of it, right to try. Hopefully you don't have to use it, OK? I don't want you to have to use it, but you know what?
If you do, doesn't it make sense, instead of doing -- I mean, if you don't have the money, you just go home and you sit there and it's -- you lose hope, and if you do have money, you go all over the world trying to find a cure. So right to try, remember it. That was a big deal. We also passed veterans choice.
Any veterans in the room? Yes. We do. Young veteran. Young. We just passed choice. That was 44 years they've been trying to pass choice, so that if you have to wait in line for 9 days, 30 days, 21 days, months, you don't do that anymore. If the line's big, and if you're unhappy with it, you go to a private doctor, they take care of you, and we paid the bill.
It's better. And you save a lot of money. It's better. They've been trying to pass that one for many, many decades. They couldn't do it. We got it passed. We're good at passing things, right? We're good. We're good at passing things, right? Oh, look. Come here. Stand up, Phil Roe. Stand up. That's right.
That's right, Phil. Man, no wonder they love you in Tennessee. Great, right? And another one, we just passed the landmark V.A. Accountability Act, right? V.A. accountability. This is where you have employees at the V.A., Veterans Administration, who are terrible, who treat our great, great warriors who are troubled.
They're not well. They're sadist. They steal. They rob. They do a lot of bad things, some of them. Some people are incredible. But we now have the right to go after them. We now have the right to fire them. The V.A. Accountability Act is a big thing. And just last week, I signed a record $716 billion funding bill for our military.
And we are giving our troops the biggest pay raise they've had in over a decade. They deserve it. And I just withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal or disaster. And we've recognize the capital of Israel and opened the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. We've done -- we've done so much, as point after point.
I will not do this to you, but look at this. Page after page after page after page after page. I mean, look at this. Created jobs, 4 million, created manufacturing, 600,000. I mean, you just go point after point -- each one is a major point. I mean, but we're not going to bore you. But nobody's done -- I'll tell you what.
Nobody has done this much in their first two years or probably in any two years -- nobody has done what we as a -- not me, what we have done with the help of all of these people and all of those people. Nobody. True. Nobody has done what we've done. [Audience Chants USA]
And we've cut more regulations than any administration, whether it's two years, four years, eight years, 12 years, in one case. We have cut more than any president, any administration, in two years, and it's less than two years, we have cut more regulations. And yet we have crystal clean water. We have pure, beautiful air.
We're into that -- also, folks, but you don't have to turn off all business and send business to foreign countries to get it. Under my administration, we are no longer apologizing for America. We are standing up for America. Standing up. And we're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Tennessee.
And we are standing up very proudly for our flag and our national anthem. We are lifting millions of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. We're building a future of safety and hope and opportunity. And every city and every community in every part of this great land is prospering like they really have never prospered before.
You see what's happening. It's a beautiful thing to watch. That's why outside right now -- I hope they haven't left -- we put big screens out there for them -- but you have close to 20,000 people standing outside. In the great state of Missouri, you had a big, beautiful arena. I always say Madison Square Garden, less maybe 30 percent, OK? Big, beautiful arena.
It was packed. And in Missouri, they had -- you saw it -- 45,000 people outside. Think of it. So something is happening. And by the way... By the way, Claire McCaskill, who is another disaster, is being soundly beaten, we hope. We hope. Missouri. Audience Member
Thank you. Thank you, 45,000. So we're fighting for the right of all children to have a safe home, a great school, a loving family and a ladder that raises them up to reach their highest dreams. Wouldn't that be nice? We're unleashing the power of faith. We need more faith in this country. The might of justice and the glory of freedom is what we're about.
But to continue this incredible momentum, momentum like -- I don't know if you've ever had this in this country -- you know, I haven't been corrected. I said the 2016 election may have been the greatest election of all time. There's never been anything like this. And we had to fight the Democrats, but more difficult was fighting a very, very dishonest media.
That was much more difficult. Fighting the media is tougher than fighting the Democrats, but they're equal partners. So you have to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote Republican and vote for Marsha Blackburn and Bill Lee and all of the great Republicans that are running.
Bill Lee, going to be a great governor. A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation -- that's a big factor -- and more products made right here in the good, old USA. [Audience Chants USA]
Remember the old days we had signs on cars and little decals all over the place? It said made in the USA. Guess what? That's what's happening now. Made in the USA. It's coming back. It's a vote to reduce crime, respect law enforcement, and restore the rule of law. Very simple. It's a vote for strong borders, safe communities, and thriving families, and a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democratic politics of anger, destruction, chaos, and to come together as citizens, as patriots, and as Americans, come together as Americans.
To everyone in this room tonight, to every citizen watching all across the land, and they do have a lot of those cameras rolling, unfortunately -- thank you. It's called -- you know what it's called? Earned media, and I earned it. That I will tell you. Earned media. Thank you very much for the earned media.
This is your time to choose. This is your time. It's the time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustration of the past. Look at what we've done. Look at what we've done in far less than two years. Look at what we've done. Nobody believes it. They don't believe it. They don't believe it. And they don't want to report it. So we report it ourselves.
They don't want to report it. By the way, 15 percent of them are OK, 85 percent, no good. And it's also a choice of whether we continue forward into the unlimited promise of our future of this great land, this great country. We were losing our country. I've had so many people come up to me, great people, some of them strong and tough -- and, you know, these aren't emotional people -- they have tears in their eyes, say, Mr. President -- I saw one tonight, came up to me, a man, strong, tough cookie, I wouldn't want to fight him, OK? And he said Mr. President -- he's crying -- he said, thank you for saving our country.
So many people say that. So many people. It is not up to the media to decide our fate. It is not up to the pollsters or the pundits -- although our polls are very good right now. They're going nuts with that one. They don't like it when we have good polls. So usually they make up phony polls, but that's OK. They're called repression.
It's repression. Darling, you know the story. I say it a lot. Darling, I really like Donald Trump, but you know, he can't win because CNN did a poll. Hey, did those polls turn out to be wrong or what? But it's called repression. It's called repression. They're phony polls, just like fake news. They're phony, fake polls.
But they said, darling, I really like that guy, but, you know, the polls say, according to some of the news, the media, because most people think it's legit, although that's changed a very lot. They said, darling, let's go to a movie and then we'll come home and watch our friend, Donald. He'll just -- oh, it's so sad what's happening.
I mean, as an example, I heard, darling, that he's going to lose Texas. I heard that he's going to lose Utah. I heard he's going to lose Georgia. So sad. So sad. Well, you know, when Texas came out at 8 o'clock, they said, ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in Texas and the winner is Donald Trump.
Ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the great state of Utah and the winner is Donald Trump. Ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the great state of Georgia and the winner is Donald Trump. You see, if it's close, they take hours and hours and days. But when you win a landslide, they do it -- that's when I kept hearing he could be in trouble in Texas.
Yeah, I'd like -- I'd like to have trouble like that all the time. We love Texas. And Ted Cruz is starting to do really well in Texas now. And he is a friend of mine. He's doing really well. He's going to win by a lot. He's going to win by a lot. But we had a -- was that the greatest evening? Tell me. Go back two years, almost two years.
Was that the greatest evening, like, ever? Was that, like, the greatest evening? Remember the board? And, boy, that center, that whole thing -- outside a little blue here, a little blue here -- did you see the red -- the whole thing is red? And by the end of the evening, nice guy, John King, his hand was trembling.
He said, oh, oh, Wisconsin, that's been decades. Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. His hand was shaking. What does this mean? What does this mean? Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan, and you hear the people behind him, oh, no, oh, no, don't. Remember that? Remember Pennsylvania? Pennsylvania hadn't been won for many years by a Republican.
It's a great state, great people. I thought we're going to do well there, I thought we were going to -- but all Republicans think they're going to do well in Pennsylvania and then they lose. So I thought we're going to do great in Pennsylvania. Do you remember? There was 1 percent of the vote left. If we lost every single vote, we win by a lot.
They refused to announce it. They refused. They waited until, like, what time, 1 o'clock in the morning? I said, wait a minute, if I lost every single vote, I win by a lot. Announce it. They wouldn't announce it. But they had to announce Wisconsin, Michigan. So nothing mattered. But that was one of the great evenings -- you know, that was one of the greatest rating evenings in the history of television, all because of you.
That was a great evening for all of us. And hopefully, we're going to have another great evening in November and you're going to get Marsha in there, because that's so important, Marsha Blackburn. It's up to you to choose our future. It's up to you to choose prosperity and pride over socialism and decay.
It's up to you on November 6th, right, November 6th, November 6th, 2018, loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We're returning power to the American people. That's what we campaigned on. This great state, the state of Tennessee, was forged through the sweat and sacrifice of tough pioneer men and women, tough people, good genes you have, good genes.
This is the state of Davy Crockett and Andrew Jackson. Andrew Jackson, who continues to be on the $20 dollar bill. You know that? Andrew Jackson -- they actually -- you know, they were comparing what we did a year-and-a-half ago -- thank you -- I think it was good what he said -- we were comparing -- they were always comparing it to Ronald Reagan.
Then as we went along, they were going -- then they actually started saying, no, the only one that we compare this one is Andrew Jackson. He had one wild election. And then they say, toward the end, and then with the big victory, they said, no, this was actually greater than even Andrew Jackson. And I'm a big Andrew Jackson fan.
And I went to Andrew Jackson's home in Tennessee. And it was great. And it was special. And he was a tough cookie, and he was a great president, too. This state is the home to generations of proud Americans who defy dangers and brave the elements to defend their families, their country, and always to defend their values.
This is what they do. They defend their values. They defend their families. What else do they defend? They defend our great American flag. Don't they defend that? They defend our flag. Just like the pioneers and patriots who came before us, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win.
We're winning. We're winning. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never, ever back down like these people over here. They'll never back down. Like him. Like him. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory, victory, victory. Because, as you know, we are American.
And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Tennessee. Thank you.
Well, I just want to thank the people of Louisiana you have been so great. Right from the beginning. Right from the beginning and I'm thrilled to be back with thousands of loyal rock ribbed, American Patriots. That's what you are, that's what we are. You work hard, you pay your taxes, you raise your children, you follow our laws, you respect our police, you defend our values and you stand strong for God, family and country.
Tomorrow you will head to the polls and you will vote to replace a liberal Democrat who has sold you out, John Bel Edwards with a great new Republican governor. Now this Saturday, you also have a not a bad football game coming up. Right? Not a bad game. I guess, they're both unbeaten. I was watching a little bit of a clip today.
Your quarterback does not look too bad, does he? Boom, boom, boom. Well, it's a great game LSU and Florida. So here's what you do. So important. I want you to enjoy the game, but I don't really want you to enjoy the game if you don't vote first. You know why? Because you'll be sitting there watching some incredible football and you feel guilty, it will ruin your entire afternoon.
So go out and vote and then go and enjoy the game the way it should be enjoyed. As you've seen under Republican leadership, America is stronger than ever before and that's what's happened. We've created 6 million new jobs and opened 10,000 new factories since my election. The United States has the hottest economy on earth.
You know, these prime ministers and presidents and kings and queens and I'd hate to say it, sometimes dictators, but we take them as they come. Right? We take them as they come, but they always sort of, "Sir, congratulations on the great job you've done with the economy." Get the hottest numbers, get the hottest economy in the world.
We've got the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world and had our opponent gotten elected. You would right now be the No. 2 economy to China and we are now so far ahead. It will never happen if smart people are standing here. We've ended the war on American energy and with your help, right here in Louisiana, the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on the planet.
And how about these Democrats? They want to get rid of oil. [Audience shouts "Boo"] They want to get rid of natural gas. They want to go to wind. Hell, darling, I just can't watch the show tonight. The wind, it just stopped blowing. I can't watch LSU and Florida, there's no wind today. I'm angry, I'm really angry at John Bel Edwards.
He has not done the job. We are securing our borders, taking care of our great veterans and restoring the unrivaled might of the US military like never before. And by the way, and we're going to introduce some but you have two great Senators here tonight. You have great Congressman. We approved something called, Veterans Choice.
The veterans now, can go see a doctor outside of the V.A. if they have to wait for two weeks or three weeks or three days, they can go and they can see a doctor. We pay the bill, they get better. People are waiting for four, five, six, seven weeks. So our veterans, we're taking care of our veterans. Do you notice that with the veterans?
I -- because a lot of veterans here. But you notice? It used to be all the time, every time. Oh, there's a veteran. Where's the veteran? Right there? How are you sir? He looks like a veteran too. Not going to mess with him. Great. Thank you very much. But you notice? We don't see the bad stories about the veterans.
Now, the fake news will go out all over the United States. [Audience shouts "Boo"] They'll look. They'll look -- NBC is one of the worst in the world. They'll look -- they'll look for a veteran. They're going to find a veteran that's not 100% happy and they're going to make him a star. But you notice? For a year and a half, we've been in great shape, right?
They don't talk about the veterans. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Get them out. Wow. You know what? Your police work fast. They work fast. [Audience cheering] They don't mess around in Louisiana, do they? It's called, out. That was beautiful. I love to see it. Our police are great, law enforcement great. Doing an incredible job.
With all of our nation's gains are put at risk by a rage filled Democrat Party that has gone completely insane. For nearly three years, Democrats have waged a non-stop battle to overturn your vote, overrule your voice, override your values and overthrow the results of the most spectacular election in the history of our country 2016. But your Senators and your Congressman and frankly, the real Senators and the real Congressmen and women of this country, they're not standing for the good people of Louisiana.
Will never ever stand for it. It's a hoax, it's a hoax. The Democrats are fighting to restore the wretched political class that threw open our nation's borders, shipped away our jobs, sacrificed our well, surrendered our sovereignty, flooded our cities with drugs and crime and bogged us down in one foreign war after another.
The endless wars have to stop. Have to stop. We're directly taking on the unholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians, deep state bureaucrats and the fake news media. There they are right there. [Audience shouts "Boo"] You know, it's really funny, I see all those red lights on. That means, you're live.
Right? As soon as I start talking about the fake news, I see those lights go off so fat, but then they come back on. And you know why? They come back on because last night, by far, all over the cable, all over the place, the highest rated show was what we did in Minnesota, a state that we're going to win.
That's why they come back on because they had no choice. They may hate Trump, but they want to get those ratings. Hey, what's going to happen in 12, maybe 16 years? When I'm no longer President. See, I'm just driving up here. Their ratings are going to tank. I actually think they're going to endorse me. Because if they don't, can you imagine having Pocahontas as your president?
[Audience shouts "No"] Now, the real Pocahontas we wouldn't have minded, but the fake Pocahontas you can have. Or how about sleepy Joe? [Audience shouts "Boo"] His son, who knows nothing about energy unlike the people in this room. He flies into the Ukraine. He flies into Ukraine, he walks out with $168,000 a month, $3 million, never -- he doesn't know what a gasoline tank looks like.
And they're paying him hundreds of thousands a month then he flies into China and he takes out $1.5 billion. I got to tell you, you know, I just made a great China deal today for energy, for the farmers, for the banks for so many. You know, technology. One of the greats. Phase 1, its a big phase. In fact, the biggest problem, it'll be 40 to $50 billion in farm purchases.
I don't think our farmers can produce that much. I said, "That's okay." You know, my people said, "Sir, could we make it 20?" I said, "No, make it 50." Our farmers will buy more land and they'll buy bigger tractors. Right? [Audience cheering] Now, they actually said, "I want my farmers, I love my farmers.
I want them to come back to be." "Sir, we can't produce this too much, it's too much sir. It's too much. We can't produce that much wheat and corn and all that stuff." Because I want to tell you, I got China to order a lot. And it's true, it's not true. No, it's true. So China in their record year, of course they'll catch it within you know, $2, it was $2 off.
He gets a Pinocchio. All those Schiffs got four Pinocchio's for making up what I said or the phone call. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Shifty Schiff. But their biggest year was $16 billion in aggregate. That's a lot. Sixteen billion, that's a lot of corner. Sixteen billion was their biggest year. They're going to buy not 16, not 20, not 30, not 40. They're going to buy between 40 and $50 billion worth of agriculture price.
And my people said to me, "Sir, they can't do it. They cannot produce that much." I said, "You know what?" No, it's true my people wanted to stop at 20. I said, "I'm not stopping at 20." I want them to come back and say, "Sir, we can't do it." Because I love my farmers. But they're going to be out there busy.
They'll be going -- they'll be go -- they're going to be more tractors sold and they're going to be bigger and better and more powerful. And they're going to be made by American companies like John Deere and Case and Caterpillar. So for your Senators and you Congressmen that are here, that was one hell of a deal.
This is phase one, phase one, you got to see these and they are happy to do it. They are happy to do it. We had a great relationship. And I tell you, so let me get back to Biden. Right? Remember? Where's Hunter? You know, last night I said, "Where's Hunter?" It became like the hottest thing in the whole country.
Are you said, "By the way, where's Hunter?" He walked out of China. So he walks out with $1.5 million and I said, "You know, those aren't the same guys that I've been dealing with from China for the last year and a half." Those guys don't give you a 1.5 billion and you know nothing. That's not the same Chinese people, I want to meet those people.
Instead of 50 billion, it would be $500 billion worth of corn. So it's a crooked deal and the fake news is always covering up for Joe Biden. Right? [Audience shouts "Boo"] The fake news, they go, "One of the claim is totally unsubstantiated." Every single newscast. With me, any claim is okay. With them, well, the claim is totally unsubstantiated.
And I say, but it's not unsubstantiated. He took out a fortune out of Ukraine, knew nothing. Took out a fortune out of China. How tough is China? I called one of the biggest people on Wall Street, friend of mine, really big powerful guy. Disaster. I said, "Let me ask you just one question. What are the chances of doing that?" He said, "Zero." I said, "So you're the biggest on Wall Street, Steve.
Steve, you're the biggest. What are the chances you could do that?" He said, "Even the big ones can't do that." But for a guy to walk in off the street with no experience, a bad track record just got thrown out of the Navy and he walks away with 1.5 billion. And then these people, these crooked people back there say, "This is totally unsubstantiated." [Audience shouts "Boo"] Can you imagine John Kennedy, Bill?
Can you imagine if Don Junior or if Eric Trump or if our beautiful Ivanka she works so hard. Can you imagine? If they walked out with one and a half billion dollars, they wouldn't be saying totally unsubstantiated. They'd be saying, "Where's the nearest cell? This is a horrible thing." So it's a disgrace what's going on. It's a whole big fat disgrace and it's very unfair to Republicans.
But you know what? We're here and they're not. Right? The Democrats and the media, they're partners, they're partners, OK? You ever see in the -- the word manufacture, it's never been used before for this. We're talking about the southern border and they're talking about in a manufactured crisis. They said it was not a crisis that it was manufactured.
When you had caravans, we stopped it and the wall is being built like you've never seen before. Been there. But remember, a few months ago, in a manufactured crisis, ABC, NBC. In a manufactured crisis, ABC again, manufactured CNN crooked as hell in a manufactured crisis. Manufactured. Then you go to CBS, ladies and gentlemen, and I manufactured gun.
There's a word that was never used and yet every single network used it because you know what? It's collusion, it's collusion. That's the real collusion. With us, there was no collusion, that's the real collusion right there. They colluded and they conspired to sabotage our incredible movement and they wanted to sieve the American voter.
And they want to hurt the American voter. And we had an election in the history of our country. There's never been a greater victory than the victory we had in 2016 and we're going to have a bigger one in 2020. They've been trying to stop us for more than three years with a lot of crap. You know, the first time I heard about Russia, they said, "Sir, do you know anything about Russia?" "No." "Have you colluded with Russia?" And I laughed, I thought they were kidding.
And weeks would go by and hear somebody else come up, "Sir, do you know any about Russia?" "No. Not -- no, I know where its is. I don't deal with it." I sold a house to a guy about 12 years ago. He was from Russia, that's a long time ago. No, I don't know. Then they come up again, "Sir, this Russia keeps coming up. Do you know anything about it?" This is the witch hunt.
This is the insurance policy for, you know, this -- this was the insurance policy. Remember from the two lovers? If she doesn't win, we've got an insurance policy. These people are corrupt. These people are disgusting, the two lovers. And they put it on the FBI server so their spouses wouldn't find out. Because they didn't want to put it on their private.
That didn't work out too well for Peter Strzok and Lisa Page did it. Lisa, I love you. I love you, Lisa. I love you, Lisa. I love you so much I can't even see straightly. Lisa, she's going to win 100 million to nothing. But just in case, Lisa, my darling, I love you, God. Don't. Just in case she doesn't win, we got an insurance policy.
Essentially saying, we're going to take him out. These are corrupt people, folks. And then she said, "Peter, I love you, I love you so much. You're so great, Peter." I -- I don't think she loves him too much anymore. Do you think? I don't think she loves him. I hear the word, it's not too good. The word is she's not in love anymore.
We've been living through this so-called insurance policy because they know, we're putting a stop to their pillaging and they're plundering and they're hoaxes. The radical Democrats policies are crazy, their politicians are corrupt, their candidates are terrible and they know they can't win an election day.
So they're pursuing an illegal, invalid and unconstitutional, bullshit impeachment. [Audience cheering] [Audience chants "USA"] They're scammers and con artists, perpetrating, hoaxes and witch hunts. A man like Greg Jarrett, great guy. He wrote a book and the book tells you the whole story. Best seller book.
Greg Jarrett, great guy, so many. Bongino, I tell you, so many. He's not a lawyer, but he -- he's better that the lawyers. He's called street smart. But these are great so many great people. John Solomon should get the Pulitzer Prize. How about these fraudulent writers at The New York Times? They get Pulitzer Prize and they got it all wrong.
They have to give back their Pulitzer Prize. But that's a fix also, isn't it? I've just won the Pulitzer Prize for talking about Trump and Russia, but they were all wrong now. Now, the people that were right, like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson, Judge Jeanine and Watters, my Watters.
And frankly, the best show by far in the morning is Fox and Friends. Also got the best rater. And Lou Dobbs, how about Lou Dobbs? And Varney, he's great. You know, Varney's great and Maria Bartiromo. And you know what? And -- and then many others, many others, many others. But they get it right. But why is it, John Solomon?
Why are these people getting the real Pulitzer Prize? Because they were right, they called it right. The Times, The Washington Post, they're dishonest, horrible. I think very, very bad for our country publications. It's a phony deal. So their writers get Pulitzer Prizes for getting it wrong and the great writers that really got it. And I don't know them, I never even met some of these people, but the ones that really got it right, they go home empty handed.
It doesn't work that way. And the people see it, you know, the people see it. So some of the names that I mentioned, all of the names that I mentioned and plenty that I didn't, I'll tell you, thank God we have them on our side. And in its own way thank God, that we have a thing called social media because we get the word out.
Like nobody has ever gotten the word out before, but it's called the witch hunt. The story of the greatest mass delusion in American political history, that's what it is. This is one of the great con jobs ever. We must never let it happen to another President. This should never be allowed to happen again.
When shift goes out and speaks before Congress, they never thought I was going to release the transcript of my call, oh. And this whistle blower, what's going on with the IG? How come the IG brings a whistle blower forward? And the whistle blower who works now for Biden, did you hear this one? Came out yesterday.
But the whistle blower comes out with a totally phony report on my phone call, but they never thought I'd release it. So they were gonna be okay. Eight times, quid pro quo except it was no time. And if you listen to what they said, it sounded horrible. That's why I had to release it. I called up Ukraine and said, "Do you mind?" I had one of my people, make a call.
Do you mind if we release it? They said, "What the hell is that all about?" And by the way, the President of Ukraine yesterday came out and he said, "He did nothing wrong. What are you talking about?" I think they look at our country, they think we're all crazy. They think we're crazy. But he said really nice, the new President, good guy and he got elected on an anti-corruption platform because Ukraine is. You know, Ukraine is known as a, unfortunately, very corrupt place, but they'll straighten it out.
But he came out yesterday and he said so strongly and the fake news hardly puts him on. Hardly puts him on. And he said it before, he said it at the United Nations and his foreign minister said it so strongly. He said, "There was nothing wrong with that call. There was nothing wrong." They don't even know what the hell we're talking about.
But nobody thought I'd release the call. Probably nobody thought we had a transcript. So when I heard the viciousness -- but here's the worst of all, worst than the whistleblower. Now the whistleblower, what's this is a whistle? Why are we protecting a person that tells you things that weren't true? But listen to this, so shifty shift.
Shifty. A little out a -- a little out a shift. Adam, I've had you up to here. I've had you up. A little out of shift. He comes out and he made up my conversation. And I was watching, fortunately, because a lot of people sort of think like, oh, I guess that's what he said. I said, "I never said that." And then when Pelosi, nervous, nervous Nancy.
[Audience shouts "Boo"] Nervous Nancy. Nervous Nancy. Nervous Nancy. I used to think she loved the country, she hates the country because she wouldn't be doing this to the country if she did. She hates the country, Nancy Pelosi hates the United States of America because she wouldn't be doing this. And I'm telling you, foreign nations, foreign people looking at us. They honestly think we're nuts.
And then you have Presidents and saying nothing was wrong. The President of the country. That's in question. But Nancy Pelosi said, "Well, that's what he said. Isn't it? But she was angry as hell when she got to read the transcript. Because she said, "Wait a minute, that's not what I was told." But she was stuck, she was stuck.
But think of a guy, who makes up a phone call, makes up my words, viciously says, eight quid pro quos. In other words, you got to do this and we're not going to do that. And there were none. There were none. They couldn't believe it when I released that call. I would have loved to have seen their faces. And then he goes before the United States Congress and before the American public and he makes up the story of what I said.
Made it horrible and vicious, not even close. It's not like, gee, he missed a couple of words. He missed every word, he missed every. He made it up, it was fiction. It's unbelievable. And honestly, I don't know Congressman, but are you immune from something like that? That should be a crime. That should be a crime.
Anyway, that's why tomorrow I need you to send the radical Democrat establishment a loud and clear message. You are going to fire your Democrat governor who has done a lousy job and sent a great Republican to the governor's mansion. When John Bel Edwards ran for office, he made your state a sacred promise that he would not raise your taxes.
Then he got elected and broke that promise by ramming through the largest tax hike in your state's history, John Bel Edwards. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And you know, because the state obviously likes me, I think I won like by. A lot. I don't even know why the hell you like a guy that lives on Fifth Avenue, but I like you too.
But I used to go to construction sites, my father would be putting up houses or building and I'd go and work with the workers. And that's when I realized these are the people I love. These are the people. These are the real people. I know them all. I know the good ones, I know the bad ones, I like those workers.
But John Bel Edwards, lie to the people of Louisiana while every other state is making massive job gains, you don't even notice. Edwards terrible policies are killing jobs across your State. Edwards is now trying to destroy Louisiana's energy sector, you know that. Right? With threats and lawsuits inspired by the radical left wing, Washington activists and Democrats.
What he's doing? Right? John Bel Edwards, not good. Goes around saying, "I like Trump very much. He's very good." But behind my back, he doesn't like me. Friend of mine knows him well, he said, "Behind your back, he's not so good." John Bel Edwards was a super delegate for crooked Hillary Clinton and he supported -- by the way, it looks like Bernie lost his chance.
Right? Bernie was hitting a baseball today to show how strong he was. They just wasn't a lot of bad head speed. Bernie get better for -- but Bernie I just suck -- I get better work, get better fast. It's only time I've ever said anything good about him. But -- but boy did they take advantage of him four years ago and he let him do it. You can't do that.
You can't let people take advantage. He figured out wait four years, it's a little bit tough. But it looks like, you know when Bernie gets out, which seems inevitable. When Bernie gets out, it looks like those will go to your radical leftist Elizabeth Warren. Right? And that unfortunately, will be the end of sleepy Joe because I would really, probably, most like to run again.
I don't know, it's sort of any and I don't care. Whoever it is, just put him out there. Let's get this thing going. But John Bel Edwards supported far left candidates like Stacey Abrams. Our friend, Brian Kemp, he did a number on Stacey Abrams. She's still saying, "What happened? What happened?" She had Oprah.
You know, Oprah used to be a very good friend of mine. She used to go to Mar-a-Lago, place I have in Palm Beach. She loved Mar-a-Lago, she loved the key lime pie. She did. No, so do I. She loved the key lime pie, but she used to go. She loved me until I decide to run for office. But she went to Georgia and she campaigned for Stacey.
And Obama went and Michelle Obama went and they campaigned. And all Brian Kemp had was Donald Trump. Now, we had a rally at the airport and there were 55,000 people at that rally. That was the day before, maybe two days before the election. I said Brian, "Congratulations. You're going to win, you're going to win." And he won by two and a half points, which was amazing.
Every star, everybody went down there for Stacey Abrams. Louisiana cannot take four more years of a liberal Democrat governor raising your taxes, killing your jobs, attacking your industries and taking money from open borders extremists. How about these people? They want open borders. Let everybody come in, let them all come.
Tomorrow, you've got a vote John Bel Edwards out. And the way you do that is before the game you got to get going. You got to just leave it an hour early, maybe even a half an hour. Ten minutes, I don't care. Be late for the game I couldn't care less. But you got to vote before the game. And what it is? Just so you understand, it's a runoff.
So if he does, he get 50% then one of our two great candidates will win, that. And it'll be John Bel Edwards against one of our two great guy and they're both great people. They're great. Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone. Ralph Abraham and Eddie are both pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-life and they're pro-Louisiana energy if that's okay.
You know, I was here a couple of months ago and they opened the biggest LNG plant I have ever seen in my life. Right? Were you there? And they've been trying to get this thing approved for years and years and years and they couldn't. And then President Trump came along and I got those permits so fast for them.
These big energy executives were sitting back and they couldn't get it approved. Nothing they could do, wouldn't get it approved. Your governor was lousy, they were all lousy. Nobody could help. That thing was so dead and I came along and I got it approved and then the consultants probably called up these big energy executive, "Sir, we were able to get it approved for you." I never even saw these people, but I know it was a good thing.
And they probably got millions in consulting fees. I'd rather give it to you people or rather give it to something charity, but they came along. I could just see, nobody knows consultants better than me. They make the environmental rules tough so you have to pay them a lot of money to skirt your way through, but it takes years and years and millions and millions.
So I got that plant approved and I came down two months ago, right? Two and a half months ago, cut a ribbon. I'd never seen anything so big and now they're going to double it up, I understand. And they're building an even bigger one in another location of Louisiana. Right? They will protect your Second Amendment, our two guys and John Bel won.
John Bel Edwards, when it gets close and they start calling from Washington and Juma and Pelosi call, "We want you to get rid of the Second Amendment." He's 100% going to drop the Second Amendment. You're not going to have the rights that you have or anywhere close. John Bel Edwards will not protect your Second Amendment.
Our guys support your police, they defend the great workers and families of this state. If you want a governor who will fight for your values, get out tomorrow and cast your ballot for Eddie or Ralph. It's very important. Eddie and Ralph where are you? Eddie and Ralph, where are you? Come up, come up here.
You know what? So here's the problem, we're on live television all over the place. They don't like this because they go up, they say, "Put trump back on, he gets better ratings." So I've been telling you, these guys, are the greatest. Here's the thing, I'm going to have let's say like a quick minute or two, but you're not allowed to hit your Republican opponent.
You're only allowed to hit John Bel Edwards because he deserves to be. Go ahead. Go ahead Ralph. Go ahead.
Is this incredible? Is this incredible? Yes. We need someone to do for Louisiana, what President Trump has done for the USA. We need a conservative, we need a businessman, we need someone who's not beholding the special interest. We need someone who will fight for Louisiana. That's why I'm in this race, folks.
Let's go get it. Let's fire our John Bel Edwards and let's thank our President for coming down here to help us.
I just want to thank the President for coming into Louisiana and making Louisiana we need him to make Louisiana great again and myself. Mr. President, we thank you. Thank you so much for taking care of our veterans, for rebuilding our military and for protecting our southern border. And Mr. President, I dropped a resolution to expel Nancy Pelosi from the House of Representatives.
Go America, go Louisiana.
Thank you, fellas very much. I appreciated it. OK. You got to do it tomorrow, let's go get a run off and both of these two guys are fantastic. Let's vote tomorrow for the entire Republican ticket, just vote. We're also delighted to be joined by two really good friends of mine. These are warriors, these are warriors.
Different types of people, but equally, I mean, they fight for you and they love this state and they love this country. One hears a strange name when I first heard. He called me up, "So they said there's a man named John Kennedy on the phone." I said, "Who?" "He's running for the Senate in a state that likes you a lot." I said, "Where?" "Louisiana." And I said, "Let me check it out." And it was true, there was a man named John Kennedy, a very successful guy, a brilliant guy.
You're not going to know what this means because I'm a big, like student. I like academics, believe it or not. People don't know. My uncle was a professor for 35 years or something at M.I.T.. I like that stuff. He went to Oxford. Oxford is like, as good as it gets. And he was a student at Oxford, you know he puts on that country's stuff all the time, about I want to tell you.
And we know the country smarter than the other guys anyway. But -- so John Kennedy goes it, I'd love to have your support. I really love it if I could. But I said, "John, to me, you're the real John Kennedy, you're the real deal and we came down." It was I'll never forget, it was a Friday night, and it was this massive airplane hangar someplace.
I don't know where the hell I, all I know is in your great state. And we had thousands and thousands of people show up. And I looked at him and I liked him and I looked at that crowd, I said, "You know what? I think you're going to win tomorrow." The election was on a Saturday and John Kennedy won by a lot.
It was a great thing and a great thing for our country. Where is John Kennedy? John come here, come here, come here John. And then, we have another guy. Any time I talk about healthcare. Anytime, I want to know anything about medical, anytime I want to know anything about taking care of people, I call a man named Bill Cassidy.
He's incredible. What a heart, what a heart. Come on up here, John. Come here John. Oxford.
Is this incredible or what? I mean, is this Louisiana? Got -- I told you, Donald J. Trump loves Louisiana like the devil loves sin.
Mr. President, thank you. Now Mr. President, earlier, I gave him a quiz. I imagined you were running against Joe Biden [Audience shouts "Boo"] and I asked him a set of questions who's more likely to secure the southern border, Joe Biden or Donald? [Audience shouts "Trump"] But there's one question I forgot to ask him, who promised to build a new Calcasieu River Bridge? [Audience cheering]
Two great men, two great men. Two great Americans. Another man who's very brave. He was really in bad condition. I was at the hospital that night that he was expected to die. He was looking too good that night. I have to tell you, I went there and the doctor said, "It's almost impossible to save him." And I must ask him today, I swear it. I think he's better looking now than he was two years ago.
The greatest thing, he was playing baseball. He was shot while they were practicing, he was shot at second base, Steve Scalise. Right Steve? But the greatest story. The greatest story. So he's recovering and I mean he really -- I don't want to go into it, but he -- he had a lot of damage. And he went out and he played in the baseball game like six months later, seven months later, he could hardly stand up. And they had a bit second base, he didn't have big range.
Like I'd say, range would be about six inches. And the first batter, rips a ground ball, right at him. I said, "Oh, this is going to be terrible." And he got down and he got that ball. And he caught it and he threw it the first, he could barely throw, he threw it the first and the batter was out of sight.
That's like a miracle. The first pitch of the game. I said, "How tough is that?" I don't think anybody else would have been able to stop that sucker, that was hard hit. But he's a great friend of mine and he's another one. He loves your state. He loves you so much and he's really a brave guy, Steve Scalise, Steve.
And then we have some other great warriors, great Congressman. Thanks, Steve. Great, great Congressman, Mike Johnson, Clay Higgins. Come on up, folks. Derrick Graves, Derrick Graves, what a group? They're warriors. Thank you, fellas. Thank you. They make our lives so much easier in Washington. We can always count on Louisiana.
Can we stay here? You have a man who is your Attorney General Jeff Landry, he's terrific. And Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, Kyle Ardoin. And you have an Agriculture Commissioner, Mike Strain, well known all over the country. And Insurance Commissioner, Jim Donnellan. Thank you, Jim. And solicitor general, Liz Murrill.
Thank you. Thank you. Nice hat. And we are going to do something that a lot of Presidents and a lot of people have said and you need it and all the work is done. It's getting ready for final approvals. That's the hard part. In many cases, not the money, it's the approvals. It's all done. We're going to rebuild the I-10 Calcasieu River Bridge.
Was set. Right? Right? We're going to build it, Calcasieu. Finally, I would like to welcome the winners of the 2019 Little League World Series championship. So I have it. They're Louisiana's own River Ridge, Little League baseball team, but I have to tell you the crazy story. So I mean, look at his handsome kids, it drives me crazy, how good looking they are.
Look at them. So kids stay there for second because I got to tell you. So I'm in the White House today and we had the little league girls championship team, and they were incredible and they come from North Carolina and they were undefeated. I think they were like 20, you know. And then of course, I got into a competition, who's better you or them?
And one of these guys gave them a 25% chance. I don't know if you're very a popular on your team. Anyway, that's a pretty good. But they were incredible and they had a tremendous team, North Carolina. And then I said, "So you're from North Carolina?" And then the guys came in and I said, "Where are you from?" They said, "Louisiana." And that one guy, he's like 6 foot too, he's 12 years old.
And he's the pitcher. And he throws the ball, they say -- one of the young guys was telling me, 75 miles per hour. I said, "No wonder, you won. The other team can't see the pitch. That's pretty good, 75. I think he's being recruited by the entire major leagues already. He's 12 year old. But I said to him, "So where are you from?" They said, "Louisiana." I said, "You won't believe this.
I'm going on a beautiful plane called Air Force One, world's most beautiful plane. I'm going to a place called Louisiana, you want to come?" Right? Right? And they looked at their parents, I'd say I don't want to take their parents to heck with their parents. I didn't want to take their coaches, but their coaches are great and their coaches are here and their coaches -- raise your hand, coaches.
Think you've come up with them. But they won, the whole deal all over the world. They're the No. 1 team. And there's like -- somebody told me, they sort of were like thousands of teams all over the world and they won. And I got so used to watching Japan win. You know, for years Japan won, I think they ended up beating Curaao. Right?
Curaao. But Japan would win and it was always a little controversial. You know, to be a guy in youth, 12. Of course, I -- I'm not saying this, I won't. He's 12, but he seemed to be 18. But I'm only kidding Prime Minister Robbie. Because Robbie's a friend of mine, so he'll understand by the way I kid. He threw the ball, this one kid about 109 miles an hour, faster than any major leaguer and he was 12. He had the greatest muscle tone anybody's ever seen for a 12 year old.
But Japan always did great. But this year you have the world champions Little League, from Louisiana. [Audience cheering] So congratulations to Will Andr, Gavin Berry. Come on up here, kids. Jeffrey Curtis, Ryan Darrah, Derek DeLatte, Marshall Louque, Conner Perrot, Ryder Planchard, Egan Prather, Reece Roussel, Alton Shorts, Peyton Spadoni and Stan Wiltz.
Boy, I'll tell you what? I just said, does anybody want to say something? They said, "No, no, no." But you and I know, they don't joke. We know, you don't joke. You don't know what the word joke means, right?
Thank you all for the support.
So where's this big pitcher like six, two and 75? Come here now, come on. Come here. I want to represent this guy. Somebody's going to make a lot of money representing him away. He's 350 pounds and can't get out of his seat. You're ready for the Major League someday?
Yes.
What do you throw, at 70 to 75? And did you do pretty well? He kept them pretty well shut up, they couldn't see the ball, right? And why did you win the last score? What was the score? eight to nothing, right? Eight to nothing. So you didn't pitch a bad game, right? Thanks fellas.
Thank you.
I don't think they want to leave us. You go ahead. Go ahead right there.
Thank you.
Thank you kids. Great job. [Audience cheering] Thank you, fellas. Champions. There's no joke. They don't joke and we don't joke. We don't like jokers. With the help of everyone here tonight, America is booming again and winning like never before. We're winning, we're putting America first. You haven't heard that in a long time.
Seven million Americans, have been lifted off of food stamps since our great election. Unemployment just reached his lowest rate in over 50 years. Unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans have hit all time lowest rates in the history of our country. Wages are rising fast and they are growing twice as fast for low income workers.
They have the biggest percentage increase, low income workers. One point three million fewer children live in poverty today than when I was elected, 1.3 million people. I've got a record number of job killing regulations. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. Nearly a trillion dollars has already been poured back home.
It's coming back in. Remember, people would have their money over there. They couldn't bring it back in. It was prohibitive. The legislation was impossible. We got rid of it, over a trillion dollars now has been brought back in and it's being spent building in the United States instead of building overseas.
Meanwhile, the Democrats running for President have pledged to abolish all American production of oil and natural gas. So that's wonderful. In other words, Democrats are promising to annihilate Louisiana's economy. But we're never going to let them do that. And I have to tell you, this isn't a campaign speech because we're going to win it by like 35 points.
One of your Senators said, one of your Senators just say. This is really, I came here to -- I get you to go out to vote tomorrow. I don't want to get too carried away with this, but one of your Senators just told me, said, "Sir, you don't ever have to come back to Louisiana. We have your back. Go to those states that are close, go to Michigan, go to Pennsylvania.
Go to North Carolina." I don't think they're very close. You know, the other night in North Carolina, two weeks ago, we won two Congressional races. They thought we'd lose one or the other was going to be maybe a one point, two point victory. We absolutely won them by so much nobody ever saw. I did something like this the night before the election.
We did this. It was the same kind of an arena. It was packed and that was North Carolina. I think we're going to do great there. I think we're going to do great in Pennsylvania. We won Pennsylvania last time, the first time in many years. We won Michigan, we won South Carolina and Florida and Wisconsin. We won Wisconsin, Wisconsin.
We need the USMCA, we got to get that approved. We got to get Nancy to approve the USMCA. If she doesn't that really, you know, we call him the do nothing Democrats and it's really the do nothings. But we'll do it after take over the house, if it doesn't get done then. The last administration betray our nation's energy workers, now we are proudly promoting American energy independence.
We're independent. I approve the Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access pipelines. Forty eight thousand jobs, my first week in office. I signed executive orders to speed up the construction of critical energy infrastructure which you people are so well aware of. And I opened up ANWR, the largest drilling site.
Perhaps, they think anywhere in the world is in Alaska. They couldn't get it done. Even Ronald Reagan could not get it done. We got it done. Bill and John and your Congressman, we got it done. We're also reversing decades of ruinous trade policies that ransacked the communities of this state. Louisiana, lost one in four manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA.
One the worst trade deals ever made in history which we're replacing. And China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, probably the worst trade deal ever made. Now, we are replacing NAFTA with the brand new U.S., Mexico, Canada agreement. And the USMC will be a massive victory for farmers and ranchers and growers and workers all across the state.
I don't know if the farmers are going to need it after China. They may say, "We can't do anymore. Please, please. We don't want anymore, Mr. President." They'll be calling me from Nebraska. They'll be calling me from Iowa. Remember, I used to say it, "We're winning so much. Please please, Mr. President, we don't want to win so much.
We're not used to it". They'll be calling me from Nebraska, they'll be calling me from Iowa. They'll be calling me a beautiful midsection, which was so beautiful, bright red, you know, they had a little blue in the edges. And if there was honest voting, I really think, I would've won that too. But there's not -- there's not.
Whatever they tell you, there's no. But they'll be calling please, we don't need anymore. We can't do it. We'll go crazy. We're working too hard. They want us too much. Is that a nice feeling? Isn't that great? Democrats in Congress should get back to work and pass the USMCA immediately. We've taken the toughest ever action to confront China's decades of abuse and now we're getting along with China.
This was a great day. This was the day, I don't know if anybody saw it. In fact, I was almost late for you because I was with China. I said, "I'm not going to be late for Louisiana even if it means standing up China a little bit." It was between Louisiana and China. I had to take Louisiana. But today, I was with the vice Premier of China, one of the most powerful men in the world, highly respected.
And we made that significant progress toward a new deal that's getting papered now. And who knows, you know, getting papered but it's going to happen. Because they want it, they want it badly. And it's going to end the mistreatment of American workers and companies. It's gonna be so great for this country.
It's going to be great for China too. We will not rest until we've achieved economic fairness and justice to the American worker and for American people. On issue after issue, Democrats have put the needs of foreign citizens ahead of our own citizens. It's true. You know, we protect borders of other countries.
We don't protect our own borders. But I want to thank Mexico, the President of Mexico, it's great. Twenty thousand Mexican soldiers are on our border. And you see the numbers? They plummeted 27,000. Think of it. All because the Democrats wouldn't approve, simple changes to what we call the loopholes, their loopholes.
It's a good name because they're just absolute mistakes made years ago. And the Democrats in 15 minutes, we could solve the problem. So Mexico, has helped us more at our border than the Democrats. Honestly, they're terrible and all they want to do is this foolishness. They don't want to pass anything. All they want to do is play these games because they're desperate to win in 2020. And instead -- you see what's happening with the polls?
It's turning the other way because people see their game. The voters are smart. In a recent Democratic debate, every single Democrat Presidential candidate raised their hand, in favor of giving free government healthcare, to illegal aliens. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And then, you wonder why they come to America?
Why wouldn't they come? Free healthcare, free education, free everything. And I jokingly said one time -- and everybody then gets a Rolls-Royce. And the fake news said, "President Trump, lied. He said that the illegal immigrants all get a Rolls-Royce." They don't have a lot of sense of humor. That's the problem with this press, what a bunch of dopes.
Free Rolls-Royce. The President told a lie. They don't get a Rolls-Royce. I'm only kidding about the Rolls-Royce. I just don't want to have a story. You know, I have a bad story. I did it again. I promised the Rolls. I -- I was just kidding. The Democrats vision for America is to rob American taxpayers to fund socialism for the entire world.
If you don't want Democrats to raid your health care, steal your money, over crowd your schools and overwhelm your communities, then you have only one choice. You have to go out tomorrow, vote Republican, get John Bel Edwards, the hell out of office. [Audience cheering] In everything I do, I never forget, that I am not President of the world, I am President of the United States of America.
We reject globalism and we embrace patriotism. We believe that every American citizen, no matter their background, deserves a government that is loyal to them. The Democrat Party and the extreme radical left are trying to abolish the distinction between citizens and non-citizens. In many cases, people that come into our country illegally used to be treated then -- I mean, they were treated better than our vets.
Hey, we have a great vet. We have a number of great vets. People that came in illegally were treated better than our vets. They're treated better than our own citizens, not anymore. Just recently, New York City -- I love New York City. We've got some real bad leadership over there now. New York City -- you know, the mayor ran for President.
He left, he got zero, how do you get zero? It's impossible. There's got to be one strange person out there, they votes he -- he got zero. And New York wanted him to do so well. They were backing him because they didn't want him back as mayor. They would have even said, "Let him be President. Just keep him the hell away from New York." But New York City, the same mayor, issued a rule that the use of the term illegal alien can now be punishable with a fine of up to $250,000. Can you imagine?
Can you imagine you're a hard worker, you're saving your money? You just built up that 250,000 after 15 years of construction work. You got 250, you're rich. You feel better than Trump ever did. And you just happened to -- when one of those bad moments, use the word, illegal alien. And they say, "Thank you very much.
I want your money." Give me that 250,000 you work your ass off for. The left's attack on free speech goes hand in hand with their attack on America's borders. The radical Democrats assault on American freedom and American citizenship will now end. Democrats also continue to encourage foreign interference in our elections by refusing to support a simple and beautiful thing called voter I. D. Maybe I can ask our Senators and Congressmen put a bill, it is so popular.
You know, if you want to go out and buy groceries, you need, identification. If you want to do almost anything you need identification. The only thing you don't need identification is to vote, the most important single thing you're doing, to vote. You don't need it. You know why? Because they cheat like hell, that's why.
Maybe John and Bill could put out a voter I.D. I never spoke to them about you guys believing that don't you? Is that OK? [Audience shouts "Yeah"] They can put it out. They'll do it. Oh, you have it in the state. Do you have a strong federal application? I love it. That's why I love this state. That's why I won by so much.
Oh, that's so great. Listen to this, now I know, why I won by so much. Because people couldn't cheat. That's great. Will you have it for tomorrow's election? Yes, I love this state it's so great. But don't change, put it out for every other state because most states don't have it. We believe only American citizens should vote in American elections, and that's not what's happening.
You go out to California, you see what's happening out there? It's a disgrace. The Voter Abuse, it's a disgrace what's happening in California. Democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which defy federal law enforcement and unleash violent criminal aliens onto your streets. Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans not for criminal aliens.
And we will always stand with the heroes of ICE Border Patrol and our great law enforcement that got that person out of here so far. Right? Last night, they had cops love Trump, but I said, "Cops love Trump and Trump loves cops." It's true. The Democrat Party, he has never been farther outside the mainstream.
Honestly, they've gone crazy. They've gone through. They're not doing anything, they're just evil. It's like they're think -- they're crazed lunatics. Every Democrat running for President is pushing a health care agenda that would end Medicare as we know it betraying our nation's seniors. My administration will always protect Medicare for our beloved seniors and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.
And will also protect your private insurance. We have 180 million people -- who has private insurance here? A lot of people. How would you like it, if they take it away? So that you can walk to a hospital emergency rooms someday. [Audience shouts "Boo"] You go to a hospital emergency room because you have a cold, it's not good.
We've taken swift action to lower the price of health care for working families with new options that cost up to 60% less than failed Obamacare. And we got rid of the individual mandate in Obamacare, the most -- the most unpopular unfair thing. That's why you pay a fortune, for the privilege of not having to pay a fortune, for your healthcare.
So you're paying not to have to pay, it's terrible. Anyway, I got rid of it. It's a big deal. That's a big deal. That was not easy. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 50 years. You see that. And we're bringing them down much lower and we're even going to give our states.
You know, the drug industry has it pretty well wired. Drugs are very expensive. Outside, in other countries, you can buy the exact same drug for 50%, 60, 70% less than you pay. Same drug, same factory, same company. Does not like a different. I just gave Rhonda Santos, governor of Florida, and I'm giving other governors the right to go to Canada and other states and other countries, other countries.
To buy the drugs, because they pay much less. We can cut our prices by 50, 60, 70% in some cases. So we're giving states the rights to go to other countries and make a deal on drugs. It's easier than going through this horrible system where the Democrats refuse to allow you to do anything to cut the price of drugs.
They don't want to let you do it. To help patients with life threatening conditions, we passed -- I love it right to try. So if you're terminally ill, if you're very sick, we have the best doctors and labs technicians in the world. They have so many different things, but it will be four, five, six years.
You couldn't get it. You know why? You're terminally ill, in the town we don't want to make you sick. You're terminally ill, you're going to be around for four weeks. And they say, "We can't give you this drug because it may hurt you." For 50 years, they have been trying to get it. Not that easy. You'll not going to get it pretty quickly.
I said, "You know, what we'll do? We'll do these like little disclosures." Let's say, you'll not going to sue the government. You'll not going to sue the drug company. You're not going to -- I have them come in. But people come in, now they sign. And I tell you, it's a miracle. So many people have been saved.
It's incredible, it's incredible. They don't have to wait six years, they'll be gone. Right to try, proud of it. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports, late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Right up to the moment of birth. That's why, I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party -- The American worker, the American family and the American dream, that's what they want. Republicans want the American dream. We have confirmed 100 -- people don't ever believe this, record stuff.
One Obama gave me 142, 142 federal judges. I said, "How many do I have?" I figured it was none. So you have 142, I said, "You have to be kidding." Within two months, we'll have about 182 federal judges including court of appeals to apply the law as written, including two great Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
Our historic investment in rebuilding the military has included $25 billion to a place called Barksdale Air Force Base. You ever hear that? Right here in Louisiana, and $40 million to Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base, New Orleans, right? And our warriors have now more ammunition, more Missiles, more rockets, more tanks, more fighter jets and more of everything our troops need to defend our nation than we have ever had before and it's all made in the USA.
At the same time, we're putting a stop to the endless wars. We have to bring our folks back home. Wars going on for 19 years and we're really police agents. We're not fighting wars there, we're just policing. And we can't do it, not fair, not fair. Other countries should help us, they don't treat us right, but they're starting to. You watch.
Going into the Middle East is one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country. It's like quicksand. We spent $8 trillion in the Middle East and then we want to fix up a highway or we want to build your bridge, and they say, "Sir, it's a lot of money." We just spent $8 trillion in the Middle East, we got nothing for it. We're slowly and carefully bringing our great soldiers and warriors back home.
After decades of rebuilding foreign countries, we are finally rebuilding our own country. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Remember that? Not so long ago, not so long ago. Remember bowing? We don't like the bow. Now, you have a President, who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Louisiana.
The path to victory begins with a giant win tomorrow right here in the great state of Louisiana. With your support, we will show the corrupt Democrats in Washington that the American people are not backing down. We will never ever forget. We will send a terrific new Republican governor to Baton Rouge. So tomorrow before the game, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote Republican.
These are two great people, vote for Ralph, vote for Eddie. Get out and vote Republican. With your help, we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect more Republicans to Congress to create an immigration system that protects American jobs, wages and families.
And we'll be able to tell Mexico and their great 27,000 soldiers that are doing this as a favor to your President. We're not paying for it. We will tell them, thank you very much your services are no longer needed. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with the four beautiful words, Made in the USA.
We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and matters, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. You didn't know that this could be done. It will be ended in 10 years and we have the medicines to do. Can you believe that? And it could have been started a long time ago and they didn't do it, but I'm doing it. We've already started.
Ten years, the AIDS epidemic will be ended. Think of that? Who would have thought we could do that? We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. [Audience cheering] And above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America.
We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. They are great. I just hope they know how much we cherish them and believe in them and I think they do. We saw it last night in Minnesota. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life.
We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history and to always respect our great American flag. And here in Louisiana and all across this land, we live by the words of our national model.
In God, We Trust. That will never be taken down. We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who cross the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and we're going to defeat socialism and put a man on the face of the moon.
Proud citizens like you, helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen of Louisiana, the best is yet to come. Get out and vote tomorrow. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you Louisiana, get out and vote tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you.
Hello, Las Vegas. How are you? How is everybody? We love Las Vegas. Thank you. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be back in Nevada. You always have to say that name just right. With thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots, the people of Nevada love our country, honor our values, and always respect our great American flag.
And except for a lot of the fake news that you see from these people back here... [Audience Boos] this is an incredible time for our country. America is winning again. America is being respected again. Because we are finally putting America first again. We have the best economy in our history. And I have to tell you this, if our opponent got into office, which would have been a very sad, sad period of time... [Audience Boos, chants Lock Her Up] instead of your... It is a pretty sad day, isn't it? Don't worry.
It's all going to get better. It's all going to get better. But if our opponent got into office, your 401(k)s, instead of being up 52 percent in a short period of time, would have been down 52 percent. That's what was going to happen. That's what was going to happen. That's where it was going. Wages, right now, are rising and poverty is -- you see it. Poverty is plummeting.
Jobless claims just hit a 50-year low. Fifty. Five-oh. And the stock market today just hit another all-time high. We're fighting every day for our factories, our ranchers, our great miners, our farmers, and we are now the largest producer of energy in the entire world. And it's not by luck. We're rebuilding our military.
We're crushing the tariffs. And we're taking care of our great veterans. We're taking care of our veterans. First time in a long time. We've also just identified the first remains of our fallen warriors from North Korea, these incredible heroes, to now lay at rest in American soil. A lot of progress being made on North Korea.
Lot of progress. Do you remember, before I came in, it looked like we were going with war with North Korea? Now we made a lot of progress. Relationships are getting better and better. And we have our hostages back. And there's no more nuclear testing. And there's no testing of missiles and rockets over Japan.
We're doing well. And we're getting our remains back. Very important. We believe no American should be left behind. So we have midterms coming up. And you remember when we had that great, great election, almost two years ago. Can you believe it? And do you remember the tears from the fake news media, when it was obvious that we were going to win? [Audience Boos]
And you know what? They're still crying. Look at them. They're still crying. [Laughter] They're still crying. And let 'em cry. They don't know what the hell happened, but it happened, and that's why we're setting all-time records. That's why we're doing so well. But we have to get out for the midterms.
Promise me, you got to get out for the -- don't be complacent. You got to get out for the midterms. You got to vote. You got to vote. We need more Republicans. You know, when they say we have a majority, it's like this. It's like this. If somebody has a cold, we don't have a majority that day. It's like we have to have more Republicans in office.
We'll get everything we want, so fast. We've got to have it. So tonight, we are joined by some really terrific friends of mine and Republican leaders from the great state of Nevada, including two great candidates for Congress, Cresent Hardy, Cresent? Where's Cresent? And somebody that's been supporting me a long time, and he has shown such incredible stamina and loyalty and friendship, and we got to get him to win this race.
Danny Tarkanian, Danny? Thanks, Danny. What a great guy! Thank you, Danny. And, Danny, thank you for everything. You really are -- you've done a great job. Thank you, man. They're going to get you in. Vote for Tarkanian. Also, your next governor, a very popular guy in these parts, with a great family, Adam Laxalt.
Adam? And another friend of mine who really was outstanding, because, you know, I have a little -- to use an interesting word -- bias for this area. I love this area. You know the word bias? They've been talking about bias. Is there bias? Yeah, there was a lot of bias. You know that. But I have bias for this area and, also, for our great GOP chairman Michael McDonald.
Finally, I want you to please welcome the person that we're all here for tonight. Now, I have to say this. We started out, we weren't friends. I didn't like him. He didn't like me. And as we fought and fought and fought, believe it or not, we started to respect each other. Then we started to like each other.
Then we started to love each other. And the fact is -- and the fact is, he has been a tremendous supporter ever since I won the election. He's always been there. We can count on his vote. I mean, Wacky Jacky will never vote for us, folks. Never. She's wacky. She's never going to vote for us. [Audience Boos] You can count on his vote for Second Amendment, for tax reductions, for regulation cuts, for judges.
Oh, look at our judges! Oh, what's going on? [Audience Chants Kavanaugh] You know, one of the reasons I was elected was because you believed that I was going to pick great Supreme Court justices. And Brett Kavanaugh... And I'm not saying anything about anybody else, but I want to tell you that Brett Kavanaugh is one of the finest human beings you will ever have the privilege of knowing or meeting.
A great intellect, a great gentleman, an impeccable reputation, went to Yale, top student, went to Yale Law School, top student. So we got to let it play out, but I want to tell you, he is a fine, fine person. So, he's got tremendous support. I can tell you that. Tremendous. Just like Neil Gorsuch, who's now on the Supreme Court, has tremendous support.
So we'll let it play out. And I think everything is going to be just fine. This is a high-quality person. And a man that agrees with that, and right now, his vote is more important than mine, because he's got to help Brett get in. And I'll tell you what? He respects him just like I respect him, but with Dean, we can count on him.
With Jacky, she's never going to vote for us. She may talk it. She even says, you know, a lot of the states like, where they like Trump, these candidates on the other side, they get up and they talk nicely about me, but they're never going to vote. They say, oh, Trump's wonderful, we like him a lot. You know, I won the state by like 34 points and they get up and they say, oh, we like him a lot.
He's great. He's wonderful. But they're never going to vote for us, so it doesn't matter. I'd rather have them say bad things about me and give us their vote. They're never going to vote for us. Because they're voting for Nancy Pelosi. They're voting for... [Audience Boos] They're for the new de facto leader of the Democratic Party, Maxine Waters. [Audience Boos]
And they're voting for cryin' Chuck Schumer. Cryin' Chuck. [Audience Boos] Whereas your incredible senator, Dean Heller, is going to be with us all the time. Come on up here, Dean! Come on up here, Dean. Dean Heller.
Thanks. Hey! Boy, does this president know how to pack the people in one room? This is incredible! Mr. President, I think he just turned Nevada red today. Mr. President, welcome to Las Vegas! Home of the Running Rebels. Home of the Golden Knights. And the future home of the Las Vegas Raiders!
Mr. President, we have 300,000 veterans in the state of Nevada. They're in front of us, and they're behind us. And we're thrilled to have them with us today. They want to thank you for delivering a better health care system at the V.A. Mr. President, our veterans want to thank you for giving them the benefits and the support that they deserve.
And, Mr. President, we have thousands -- thousands of military men and women that serve here in the state of Nevada. They want to thank you. They want to thank you for funding our Armed Forces, so that they can do their jobs and serve our country. Mr. President, our military men and women want to thank you for the largest pay raise in the last 10 years. But, most importantly, Mr. President, thank you for putting Nevada back to work.
Because of your administration, Nevada families have more money in their paychecks. Nevada families have more money in their pockets. And, Mr. President, because of this stock market that you just mentioned, they're doing better with their pensions and their 401(k)s. Mr. President, it's an honor to work with you and putting Nevada back to work. Thank you very -- very much, Mr. President.
OK. Thank you, Dean. Thank you, Dean. Thank you, Dean. And Dean really is a -- a champion, and I can tell you, I work with him. He's a champion for our workers, our families, and for our veterans. And we have to keep him. He led the charge in Congress to pass the most significant veterans reforms in half a century, including the V.A. Accountability Act.
You know what that is. That means people that work in the V.A. are accountable. If they don't treat our veterans well, if they don't do a good job, if they're sadists -- and you have that -- if they steal -- and you have that -- we say, sorry, but you are fired! Right? Before you couldn't do that. You couldn't do it. Now you can do it. That's been 45 years they've been trying to get it. It doesn't sound like much.
It's everything. So much. And, most importantly, 46 years, V.A. choice, this is where a veteran has to wait long periods to see a doctor. No longer. They now go and see a private doctor if there's a line. They don't have to wait for 12 days, for 20 days, for 40 days. They go see a doctor. We pay for the doctor.
And they get taken care of. They get taken care of. And Dean has led the effort in Congress to fully fund Veterans Affairs. It's a big deal. And he's been really great. He really has. So I just want to say, there's been no better friend. We started off slow, but we ended up strong. I've had no better friend in Congress than Dean Heller.
So, thank you. Thank you, friend. We've got to elect Republicans. That means our great congressmen, potential congressmen, and we have to get Dean to fight for Nevada, to fight for our heroes, and to help us make things honest around here. You know what's going on. So we're going to drain the swamp. Drain the swamp. [Audience chants Drain the Swamp]
Early voting, so important. Early voting starts in exactly one month, October 20th. So you can vote early, but you've got to get out and vote. And remember this. Dean's Democrat opponent Wacky Jacky, Jacky Rosen, she doesn't get it. Jacky Rosen is bought and paid for by her donors, 100 percent.
She doesn't even want to go to a debate. We think she doesn't want to debate. I said, hey, Dean, when's the debate? And he said, she won't debate me. That's not good. That's not good. Rosen doesn't represent Nevada's values. She represents the extreme liberal values of her out-of-state donors, funding almost 90 percent of her campaign.
But even that, just so you understand, she's going to do whatever Pelosi and Schumer tell her to do, OK? It doesn't matter. [Audience Boos] Every one of them, they come in and they say, oh, we want to be bipartisan. They never vote for us. Jacky Rosen voted no on tax cuts. You know that? She voted for the disaster, which is really being changed rapidly.
You know, we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing. The disaster known as Obamacare. Jacky Rosen voted against Kate's Law. [Audience Boos] And she voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities, which nobody wants. [Audience Boos] And Jacky Rosen voted against the V.A. Accountability Act.
How do you do that? How do you do that? [Audience Boos] So she, really, if you think about it, she voted for criminal aliens against veterans, for criminal aliens against citizens of our country. That's where she is. You don't want that. You don't want it. A vote for Wacky Jacky is a vote for the extreme agenda of those people, as Pelosi-Schumer-Waters is a vote for more taxes.
Seriously. It's a vote for more taxes, more crime, and more onerous regulation, which stops everything from happening. You know, we cut regulations more than any administration in the history of our country, and I did it in less than two years. And it's one of the reasons that you have all of those jobs.
It's one of the reasons that you can now go out and look for another job if you're not happy, because everybody wants to hire you and you're getting higher wages for the first time in 21 years. The new platform of the Democrat Party is radical socialism and open borders. [Audience Boos] And I won't allow the United States of America to become the next Venezuela.
That's what they want to do. [Audience Boos, Chants Built that Wall] So we started the wall a year ago. We've done a lot. We've rebuilt a lot of sections of wall in San Diego and a lot of areas. We're starting a big, brand-new section. We spent $1.6 billion, then another $1.6 billion. Unfortunately, sadly, because of the Democrats' obstruction, only $1.6 billion -- sounds like a lot, but it's not when you're talking about what we're talking about -- $1.6 billion was just approved.
I'm not thrilled, but after the election, they're all telling me were getting our wall the way we want it, so let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. Let's see if they produce. In this election, and by the way, we want that wall. We want that wall. You know where I am. I could knock it out, because I do that well.
That's what I do well. I build. We could knock that wall out in one year if they gave us the funds. I'll tell you what, though, if you look at Schumer and these people, even though they know you need the wall, they all voted for the wall in 2006. They vote for border security. And then they found out, oh gee, maybe from their standpoint, they can't do that, but they all voted for it. Hillary Clinton voted for it, right?
Remember her? [Audience Boos] But -- but I'll tell you this. I'll tell you this. Everybody knows... [Audience chants Lock Her Up] How is our Justice Department doing? [Audience Boos] So they all wanted the wall. We're going to get the wall. But it would be a lot easier if you get Republicans in there to vote, please.
OK? A lot easier. Because their whole agenda -- on bigger things we can get. You see what we've gotten. We've got things that -- we got $700 billion to rebuild our military. We then got $716 billion to rebuild it second year, $700 billion and $716 billion. But their whole agenda, they know we want the wall.
They want to oppose it. They want to obstruct it. They want to resist. You know the campaign? It's called resist. Honestly, they're lousy politicians. Their policy is terrible. But they're good at sticking together and resisting. That's all they can do. [Audience Boos] And you are witnessing it right now, but we're going to be victorious.
You watch. You watch. It's all they're good at. Resist. You know, they see the signs, "Resist, resist." Ugh. [Laughter] We're for building great economies. They're for resisting. That's what it's all about. But this election, you have to vote for candidates who really know what your heart says, what your values are.
You have some great, great Republican candidates, and a lot of people think that I'm always angry at Congress. I'm angry at Democrats because of what they're doing to our country. I'm angry at Democrats because of what they do to our country. Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by left-wing haters, angry mobs, socialist fanatics, deep-state bureaucrats, and their fake news allies.
This is the big -- that's their best partner. [Audience Boos] That's their best partner. The Democrat Party, their best ally is those people right there. [Audience Boos] I can't tell you how dishonest and corrupt so much of the media is. I can't even explain it. Impossible to explain. Nobody would believe it. Nobody would.
And I don't mean everything. You have some fine people. Some fine reporters. I know them. Fine reporters. Look, all the red lights are starting to go off. [Laughter] You have some fine people and some wonderful, wonderful, professional reporters. But I watch the coverage that we get. And it is so unfair.
We could have the greatest success, like, for instance, in North Korea, we're doing great. We're doing great, moving along. What do they say? There's nothing they can say. So they say he met with them. That's a defeat, because we met. They can't say anything else. We have the hostage -- they said he met! So many things they come up and then they say, oh, it's not moving fast enough.
They've been covering these Democrats for decades, they haven't -- they haven't done a thing. I left. What did I leave, three months ago? We're doing great. But these are people that will take a great story and make it as bad as possible. They'll take an OK story and make it horrible. [Audience Boos] So I cannot tell you strongly enough, that is the single greatest ally of the Democrats.
Without them, they wouldn't be getting 5 percent of the vote. I'll tell you. It's true. It's fake news. Fake news. And you know, I have to say this, when I won the election, we won. I didn't win. We won. The whole thing, we won. The New York Times, like, they apologized to their subscribers because they covered the election so badly, because their subscribers say, how could this happen?
He got nothing but bad stories, because people don't read the New York Times, because it's a dishonest newspaper. It's terrible. But I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. When we won, they suffered. But I said -- I said -- I got one thing that I was -- in interviews, I say, you know the good news? I'll start now getting fair press.
And it happened for about a week. And now they're worse than they ever were. But it doesn't seem to have much of an impact, does it? [Audience Boos] Not much of an impact. So the resistance, to an extent, because of them, is filled with anger, because their policies have been exposed as failure. Real anger.
The forces opposing us in Washington are the same people who squandered trillions of dollars overseas, who sacrificed our sovereignty, who shipped away our jobs, who oversaw the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. That's what happened to our country. And we're now recovering. We're bringing back our jobs.
We're bringing back our companies. In 2016, the American people voted to reject this corrupt globalism. Hey, I'm the president of the United States! I'm not the president of the globe. [Audience chants USA] You voted to make America great again. We are making America greater than ever before. And it's happening before your eyes.
Bitter Democrats and their establishment cronies have spent every single day since 2016 trying to undermine the results of this incredible, historic presidential election that we won together. So we want to keep it going. And we want to do it the easy way. So this election day, go out there and vote. You got to vote.
Everybody's got to go out and got to vote. I want to give a victory speech. I want to give a victory speech on the evening of Election Day, which is coming up very quickly. We're going to be talking about America. We're going to be talking about the greatness of our country. We're not going to let people undo the incredible job that we've done over the last almost-two-year period.
So, don't forget, early voting, folks, early voting, October 20th. Now, we need -- we need in this election to do something special. I'm not saying there's ever going to be a time like we just went through. And a lot of people say that you're complacent now. You win the presidency and you're complacent. I don't think we're complacent.
And I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what I did. I'll tell you what I did. Last week, I said update it. I said update it. I want to show you -- I don't believe there has been any administration in the history of this country that has done more in two years -- and we're not even up to two years yet -- than our administration.
Look at this. So I said just write down some of the things. Each one, each one, point, point, point, four-and-a-half pages, almost 4 million jobs created since the election, more Americans are now employed than ever recorded before. Think of that. Today, more Americans are working than ever before. We've created more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs.
Remember what President Obama said? You can't have manufacturing jobs anymore? [Audience Boos] By the way, he's campaigning again. That's good news. [Audience Boos] Because if that doesn't spur you onto work -- you know, when I was running, I swear, I think he campaigned harder than Hillary Clinton. And we won big, 306-223. Remember?
There is no way, right? There is no way that Donald Trump gets to 270. No, we got to 306. Look, manufacturing jobs, which he said you'll never have again, I'm saying why won't you have it? We're not going to make anything? These are the best jobs. You know, manufacturing, they're, like, the best jobs, the most important jobs.
Manufacturing jobs growing at the fastest rate in more than 30 years. Economic growth, so they say, when I took this over, I'm telling you, it was a sick puppy. We were headed down. So last quarter, we hit GDP 4.1, adjusted upward 4.2 percent, right? Look. Point, point, point. Look at this. New unemployment claims recently hit a 49-year low.
You know what that means? Simple. That means people are working. They're working. You know this, you've been hearing, and now it's even better, African-American unemployment has recently achieved the lowest rate ever recorded. What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? Remember? Ha. Remember, I said, what do you have to lose?
People said, oh, that's not nice. I said, hey, I go through a chart, it talked about the highest crime rates, the worst education, the worst homeownership. I'd go through -- and I just looked up one night and I said, you've always been with the Democrats. Vote for me. What the hell do you have to lose? Remember that, right?
Right? Hispanic, any Hispanic here? I think so. Hispanic-American unemployment is the lowest rate in history. Any Asians? Asian? Asian? Any Asian? Asian-American unemployment recently achieved the lowest rate ever recorded in our history. You've heard me say this. Women's unemployment, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, recently reached -- I'm sorry -- only the lowest rate in 65 years.
That's not as good. That's not as good as history. Soon -- this is important. Youth unemployment recently hit the lowest rate in nearly 50 years. So great. Under my administration, veterans' unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in numerous decades, whatever that may be. Almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.
I mean, how good is that? Think of it. They live better, and it doesn't cost us anything. Right? How good is that? We have companies now under the pledge to America's workers, they're training, under our vocational programs, workers, there's never been anything like this. We have -- retail sales surged last month, up over 6 percent over last year.
We signed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in the history of the United States. As a result of the tax bill, small businesses will have the lowest top marginal tax rate in more than 80 years. That's not bad. We got, through a little work and a little coordination, the United States bid for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
We got it. That was us. We just got the U.S.-Mexico-Canada -- we just got the World Cup in 2026. We needed a lot of... I told you about the record number in history of regulations, that's such a big deal. We enacted regulatory relief for community banks and credit unions so they can now go and loan you money again.
Last month, the FDA approved more affordable generic drugs than ever before in its history. And one of the things we did with the FDA is a thing called -- I love the name -- right to try. You know what that is? It was that, if you were sick, terminally ill, and we had a drug in the hopper that looked like it was really working out, this country for 50 years would not let you use that drug.
They'd say, no, it may harm you. Well, you're terminally ill, so they couldn't get -- and there was a reason. I'm -- not that easy. A lot of liability, a lot of everything, between the insurance companies and various different things, including government. I got it done. It's called right to try. So now, instead of if you have money -- if you don't have money, there's -- you just go to your room.
If you have money -- I know people, they traveled all over the world begging for a cure. We have the greatest medical people, the greatest medicines in the world. Now you have the right to try, and it's going to work plenty. It's a big thing. We just secured $6 billion for the new funding to fight the opioid epidemic, $6 billion.
You'll like this. We withdrew the United States from the job-killing, income-killing Paris climate accord. That was costing our country. And we have the cleanest air now in the world. We have the cleanest water. Remember this. I'm an environmentalist. I want crystal-clean water. I want crystal-clean air.
That's what we want. But I also want jobs to come to our country. So that was good. We secured a record 700 -- listen to this. We confirmed more court judges, think of this, than anybody. And we're going to get -- we just got Neil Gorsuch, I told you. We're going to get Brett. We've got great people. Look at this.
We moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. We're protecting -- remember they said you'll never get that. They said that about everything. You'll never get that, you'll never get elected, you'll never this. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner is Donald Trump. Well... Remember the tears? Crying, crying, oh. Crying, crying.
Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States -- this is on television -- and I say, oh, don't cry, please, I want to be happy. Don't cry. Now they're crying more than ever! Except you know they're torn. Number one, they're crying, but they're making more money than they ever made because of us, because their stocks are up. But you know what's going to happen with these -- I tell them, about six months after we start, six months before the election, they're going to endorse Donald Trump for president.
You know why? Because if they don't, those broadcasting companies, the New York Times, all of those, they are going bankrupt so fast. So they'll be endorsing me. They'll be endorsing me. So I could go on for page after page after page. Look at that. Page after page. And to me a big thing. We're renegotiating the worst trade deals ever made by any country at any time.
So, Democrats, I had to bring that out, you know, just boom, boom, boom, why not? Democrats want to give welfare and free health care to illegal aliens funded by the American taxpayers. [Audience Boos] How about this clown in California who's running for governor? Now, think -- just think. We get a lot of people from California that moved here, but how about this guy?
Wait. He announces he wants open borders, that means just pour in, and then he wants to give them health care, education, everything. You know what's going to happen? California is going to have a billion people within a very short period of time. Now, I think -- and somebody has to ask, who's going to pay for this?
And do you know how bad it's going to be? You talk about waiting on line for the vets, which we saw? You'll be waiting on line for 10 years. It's the craziest thing I've ever heard. Open borders, come on into California, all over the world they're going to be pouring into California. Republicans want to protect the safety net for the truly needy Americans, people that need help, not for illegal aliens that come in to our country illegally.
And when it comes to health insurance, Donald Trump and Republicans will protect patients with pre-existing conditions. We're going to do that. We want to do that. Democrats want to destroy Medicare with so-called Medicare for all. It's going to be bust before it even gets open. Robbing from our senior citizens -- you know that, it's going -- it's going to be one of the great catastrophes ever.
The benefits they paid for their entire lives are going to be taken away. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and they paid for it for their entire life. They paid for it. The Democrat health care plan would force every American onto government-run health care and virtually eliminate all private- and employer-based health care plans.
In other words, you're going to have really bad health care. It's going to cost a lot of money. Their plan would cost $32 trillion and require at least the doubling of your federal income taxes, and probably much higher than that. [Audience Boos] The Democrats would bankrupt the safety net through totally unlimited and uncontrolled immigration.
You will see crime like you've never, ever seen before. The policies of their party aren't just extreme. Frankly, they're dangerous, and they're crazy. So what I want you to do -- remember, Danny and Dean and these people, you're going to go out and vote, because we're going to take this country -- and we're almost there -- remember, it's make America great again, but very shortly we're going to be changing that logo to keep America great.
Keep America. And we're going to lower taxes. [Audience Chants USA] We're going to lower taxes. They want to raise your taxes. They want to double and triple your taxes. And we are going to save and we are going to cherish ICE, ICE. Democrats want to open borders, which equals massive crime coming into our country.
Republicans want strong borders, and we want no crime. So here it is. We're going to make our country stronger than ever before. We're going to make our country richer and wealthier, and in so -- you need that. Look at how well we're doing. We're not ever going to apologize to other countries for our great success or for our great country.
You now have a president who is standing up for America. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Nevada. And we're standing up for our great national anthem. So we're going to do things. And you know what I've been saying. We're going to start winning again. We're winning now much bigger than I ever thought at a much earlier level.
Who would have thought this was going to happen? We thought it was going to happen, but not this fast. Remember this. All during our campaign, I said we're going to start winning again. And you're going to have your representative, Dean Heller, and you're going to go to him, we love this, don't we? And you're going to say, Dean, please see the president.
Nevada is winning too much. We can't stand it. We just can't take it. And Dean is going to come to the Oval Office, he's going to say, Mr. President, please, sir, stop winning so much, the people of Nevada can't take it any longer. And what am I going to say? I'm going to say, sorry, Dean, we're going to keep it going.
Look, here's the story. We really have turned it around. We're respected again as a country. Every time a person comes in to the Oval Office, a president, a king, a queen, a prime minister, they say, Mr. President, congratulations on what you've done with this country. It's true. We've never seen anything like it. All the time, I mean, I mean all -- almost all -- I have to be a little bit -- otherwise, I'll get -- almost all the time, they say congratulations.
Some of them are saying that they're emulating us, but most importantly, again, we are respected. We are really respected for what we're doing. And it's been a long time since our country has been respected. But we're respected again. [Audience Chants USA] So, I love this state. I love the people of this state.
I was here a lot. I was here a lot. I was here a lot before I did this political thing. By the way, how did that work out? That worked out OK. But, please, remember, it can be very fragile if you have the wrong people in Washington, D.C. It can all end very quickly. Bad things can happen to the economy very quickly.
It doesn't take many bad decisions. And they will make all bad decisions. We can't let it happen. So I give you a pledge: We're going to work harder than ever before. We're going to work smarter than ever before. We are going to do things that nobody thought was possible. And that's already started. So, go out and vote.
You're not letting me down. I'm never, ever going to let you down. Thank you very much. We'll be back very soon. Vote for Danny. Vote for Dean. Vote for all of them. We need Republicans in Washington. We're going to keep it. Whether it's from Las Vegas to Reno, to Carson City, we need every Nevada patriot to go out and vote. Go out and vote. We will keep it going. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Good luck.
Oh, boy, we love Nevada. We love Nevada. Thank you. Thank you. This is a great place. [Crowd cheering "Trump"] Thank you. Thank you very much. Great evening. We will be celebrating for a long time tonight. Have a good time. Have a good time. You know, we weren't expecting, a couple of months ago, we weren't expected to win this one.
You know that, right? We were, of course, if you listen to the pundits we weren't expected to win too much. Now we're winning, winning, winning the country, and soon the country is going to start winning, winning, winning. So I want to thank the volunteers, they've been unable. These people they worked like endlessly, endlessly.
We're not going to forget it. And we've had some great numbers coming out of Texas. And amazing numbers coming out of Tennessee and Georgia, and Arkansas. And then in a couple of weeks later Florida. We love Florida so. We're going to do very well in Ohio where a beating the governor, it's good. It's always nice to be beating the governor.
And Michigan -- the whole thing. I mean, it's going to be an amazing two months. We might not even need the two months, folks, to be honest. All right. So tonight we had 45 46%. And tomorrow you'll be hearing -- You know if they could just take the other candidates and add them up and if you could add them up because you know the other candidates amount to 55%. So if they could just add.
They keep forgetting that when people drop out we're going to get a lot of votes. [Crowd cheering] Remember. They keep forgetting. They don't say it. So I want to begin by thanking my boys. Eric has been all over the place making speeches, he's getting better than me so I'm a little jealous. And Don went up to Elko and you were all over, right?
And he loves the rifle stuff. This is serious rifle. This is serious NRA. Both of them. So -- both of them. We Love the Second Amendment, folks. Nobody loves it more than us. So just remember that. And Corey and Hope, the staff, the whole group and Charles, and Dan, and what a group we have, it's just amazing.
I want to just thank a couple of friends of mine that are here. The owner of this incredible hotel, Mr. and Mrs. Phil Ruffin, stand up. Great guy. Phil said, Donald, like for the last three months he's driving me crazy. He said, "Donald, I want to put $10 million into your campaign." I said, "Phil, I don't want your money I don't want to do it. I'm self funding." Every time I see him it's hard for me to turn down money because that's not what I've done in my whole life.
I grab it, grab it, grab. You know, I get greedy. I want money, money. Now I'm getting -- What -- I'll tell you what we're going to do, right. We get greedy, right? Now we're gonna get greedy for the United States. We're going to grab and grab, and grab. We're going to bring in so much money and so much everything, we're going to make America great again, folks.
I'm telling you. We're going to make America great again. And another great friend of mine somebody respected by everybody a great friend of Phil too, Mr. and Mrs. Steve Wynn. Stand up, Steve. Stand up. Two great people. Steve is always calling. He's always got advice. Right, Steve? "Donald I think you're do this and that." his advice I like to listen to, I'll be honest with you.
So Phil and Steve, and families, we appreciate it. You've been great friends. Thank you. Thank you. So this was very exciting tonight. But I'll tell you, it looks like we won by a lot Evangelicals. I love the evangelicals. And I have to tell you, Pastor Jeffress has been so incredible on television and elsewhere, he has been great.
And as you know, Liberty University, do we love Liberty University? [Crowd cheering] Jerry Falwell Jr., an unbelievable guy. And he has been with us and with us from the beginning. And I want to thank Jerry and his family, it's been amazing, the relationship. So we won the evangelicals we won with young.
We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated. We're the smartest people with the most loyal people. And you know what I really am happy about because I've been saying it for a long time. Forty six percent with the Hispanics, 46%, NO. 1 with Hispanics.
I'm really happy about that. So [Crowd cheering "Trump]thank you. So I'm very proud of you. This is an amazing night. And you know I love the country. I love the country. [Man shouted [We love you Trump] We're going -- we're going in the wrong direction. We're going to keep, as you know, get by we're keeping that open.
And we're going to load it up with bad dudes. We're going to load it up with a lot of bad dudes out there. We're going to have our borders nice and strong. We're going to build the wall, you know that. We're going to build the wall. And I have a lot of respect for Mexico and you just heard, we won Hispanics.
But let me tell, you Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Right? [Crowd cheering] Going to happen, going to happen. They know it. I know it. We all know it. We have a tremendous deficit. We have a trade deficit with Mexico. They'll pay for the well, they'll be very happy about it. Believe me. I'll talk to them.
They'll be very very thrilled. They're going to be thrilled to be paying for the wall. We're going to be the smart people. We're not going to be the people that get pushed around all over the place. We're going to be the smart people. You are going to be proud of your president and you're going to be even prouder of your country.
OK. So tonight, folks, this was a great evening. I love this place. I love this state. I love Las Vegas. I have spent and invested so much money over here. Trump International Hotel. I keep telling Steve, we have the best hotel in Las Vegas. He's fighting me all the time but that's a -- But I just want to say it's -- it's a great state.
And they have great people. And I was so proud. You know I went to caucus. I was all over the place tonight. The people are amazing. The enthusiasm, it was unbelievable to see. The people of this country are absolutely amazing. I love you, folks very much. Remember, Make america great again. We're going to do it and it's going to happen fast.
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. We love you. We love you. Thank you. Thank you. [Crowd cheering "USA] Thank you, everybody. I love you. Thank you.
Whoa, whoa. [Audience Chants USA] I love Ohio. It's great to be back in Ohio. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. This is a truly great state with thousands of hard-working, wonderful, beautiful American patriots. Beautiful. Under Republican leadership, America is being respected again. And all of those thousands of people that aren't under the shell that is standing out there, look at you.
Look at you. They're getting very wet. Thank you. Thank you, all. Thank you. There are thousands of people that can't see a thing. In other words, you're better at real estate than they are, but that's OK. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. I'm really proud to report that earlier today we secured the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson from Turkey.
He is now free from jail and he is in the air, heading to Germany, where he'll get off for a brief check, and I think he's going to be in great shape. And then he's coming to Washington, D.C., tomorrow, and we'll say hello to him. Went through a lot, you know? All about Pastor Brunson. He went through a lot, but he's on his way back.
We've done that with a lot, right? We've had a lot of success. North Korea, Egypt, remember? We bring a lot of people back, and that's good. They want to come back to our country, and they're coming back to our country. Tonight, every American heart is with our fellow citizens affected by Hurricane Michael.
Sounds like a very nice name. That was a vicious hurricane. Whether it's in Florida or Georgia or Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, a lot of areas affected, but we just want to give everybody our love. That was a devastating power that hit -- among the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit our country.
It was devastating. But they'll rebuild. They're strong. They're great people. And just God bless you all. Thank you. My administration has been in constant communication with the state and local authorities all over the various states. When we're in trouble, we pull together, we pull together like nobody.
We're here tonight to discuss the extraordinary achievements that we've made together in -- can you believe it -- less than two years? It's been Republican leadership and we are here to make sure that our amazing progress continues full speed ahead. Because America is booming. America is thriving. And America is winning, really winning again.
And we are viewing now for the first time in many decades a phenomenon called so simply America first. And it's about time. It's about time. Right? About time. It's about time. The unemployment rate has just fallen to the lowest level in more than 50 years. Manufacturing confidence just announced has reached an all-time high.
Think what that matters. Think what that is, confidence, confidence. The people of Ohio have confidence. Can tell you that. No, but think of it. If you remember the previous administration said manufacturing jobs... Other than that, you like them very much, right? But remember, they said manufacturing jobs, they're gone, they're dead.
Remember the expression, you'd need a magic wand to bring them -- bring them back? We're bringing them back. I guess we have the magic wand. They're coming back. And they're coming back from Mexico, they're coming back from Canada, they're coming back from everywhere, because they all want to be where the action is. They all want to be in the USA.
That's where we want to be. That's where the jobs are. We are now the hottest country anywhere in the world. All across... [Audience Chants USA] By the way, I wish the cameras would get this crowd. This crowd is incredible. Look at the cameras back there. It's like the Academy Awards. Look at this. How would you like to have to do this every night?
No, no, how would you like to have to do this every night? And one little mistake, one little mistake and they try to destroy your entire career. Boy. No, I mean, look at this. Seriously, look at -- look at the magnitude of it. Look at the number of the media back there. Look at that. Fake news. Fake news.
Fake. You go back and they'll say, did he say -- did he say this? Or that? Or this? That's OK. You know what, we've learned how to live with them. We've learned how to live with them. We don't like it, but we've learned. All across Ohio, steel mills are reopening, and we are putting our coal miners back to work.
One of the things we're most proud of - look, steel was dead. Steel was dead. I came into office, steel was a dead business. Now they're opening up plans, U.S. Steel, Nucor. They're opening up plants all over the country, big ones, new ones. We're taxing the hell out of the dumpers. You know, you had the dumpers that were hurting your steel industry?
And you know what happens? After the industry dies -- would have died within two years. After it dies, they would come in and they would charge you three times more money. Nobody says it, but that's what happens. So we're going to have beautiful new American-made steel... It's not going to be mud or it's not going to be sand steel.
You know they put garbage in this stuff they were dumping. We don't even know what's in it. It's going to be U.S. steel. It's going to be American steel. We're going to get the iron ore from our mines, right, beautiful. They're opening up again. Our mines are opening up again. Metallurgic coal, but our miners are back to work.
We don't need outsiders telling us about our steel industry. It's incredible. Seriously, it's incredible what's happened. It's hot as a pistol. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation, which is what we want. And this has been... [Audience Chants USA] So this has been a really historic week for America.
Really historic. And by the way, our magnificent first lady, Melania... just returned from an incredibly successful trip to Africa. It was an incredible trip. And she came back, and she told me so beautiful, so beautiful, and yet such incredible in some cases poverty. They need help. They definitely need help.
It's both beautiful and sad. It's got every kind of emotion. But you probably saw her travels. They were really incredible. And it opens your eyes to what's going on around the world. You're all very lucky in Ohio. That I can tell you. That I can tell you. Thank you. And on Monday night in the East Room of the White House, we achieved a tremendous victory for our nation, our freedom, and our Constitution.
America watched as we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Did he get treated badly and unfairly or what? Horrible. And I'll tell you what. He's done us a tremendous service, what -- the way they treated him, I've never seen anybody treated like that.
But he's done us a great service, because we are more energized as Republicans that ever -- I think ever before. I think ever before. We just got poll numbers for some of the Senate races. And you look at some of these Senate races where we weren't even going to contest. It's a Democrat that's in. We were figuring in -- you know, we're winning with candidates that are -- we're winning.
We're beating people that we weren't going to contest. So it's been amazing. Because people realize how important the Supreme Court is. And we could have two, three, maybe even four more choices, and we have to be able to get the votes to put them through. Go out and vote November 6th. From the moment Brett Kavanaugh was announced, an angry Democrat mob was on a mission to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy him.
And before they even know -- I'll tell you, you saw it. Before they knew his name, they were saying horrible things. They didn't even know who was going to be the pick. He wasn't picked. I didn't know who was going to be the pick. And they were saying horrible, horrible things. These are bad people. We can't let this happen to our country.
Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob. That's what it is. It's a mob. The people of Ohio can save America from radical Democrats. They've become radicalized. I mean, Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, seriously... No, no, seriously, she's becoming mainstream. You believe that one? We have to elect a Republican House and a Republican Senate.
We need the votes. We need the votes. And, by the way, for the people of Ohio, early voting starts right now. You got to get out. Vote early. And then anybody that votes early, you can leave. The hell with you. That's -- you know, I worked in Cincinnati, Ohio, two summers. I loved Ohio. I loved Ohio. I shouldn't tell you this, but I used to travel a lot to Kentucky.
Does anybody travel to Kentucky? Right? No, I -- I like Kentucky. But I traveled to Kentucky when I spent a lot of time in the Queen City. I love the Queen City. We had a job, Swifton Village, Swifton. Does anyone ever hear of Swifton? And it was a great experience. It was a successful experience. I did it with my father, one of my earliest things that I've done, and I guess it's sort of like if you get your first up as a hit, you're a hitter, you hit, you sink the 10-foot putt on the first hole.
But we had a great success in Ohio, and I've never forgotten it. And then they said -- remember, for months before the election, you cannot win without getting the great state of Ohio. Right? And I got the great state of Ohio. And I love the great state of Ohio. We got it. We got it. Remember? They used to say that every time.
I used to hear it. I have fantastic people in Ohio that did a job for me. Bob Paduchik, where's Bob? I had just a great group of people. They did incredible work. But they constantly would say on these phony networks, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio. And then they started doing polls, and I was way up. And I think we won it by 9 or 10 points.
A lot. We won it by a lot. In fact, you know the way, if it's close, they have to take hours and hours and hours, right? So with Ohio, I'll never forget, they said the polls have closed in Ohio. Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. Crazy. We won Ohio by so much that it took one second before they called it, OK? We won by a lot.
It's a great place. And by the way, have I produced? Look at what's coming into Ohio now. Have we produced? I produced and you produced. If Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats... take control, they will try to raise your taxes, impose socialism on this country, take away your health care, and take away your jobs.
We have more people working now than ever before. They want to take away -- that's what will happen. The Democrats want to erase America's borders and let drugs, gangs and crime pour into our country. In fact, I've been going around lately saying the Democrats are the party of crime. And nobody even challenges me, not even the fake news media.
They don't even challenge me. Republicans are the party of safety and Republicans are the party of jobs, jobs, jobs. And that's what's happened. And we're honored to be joined tonight by many terrific Ohio Republicans, including Republican Party Chair -- I have to say, this woman is incredible, because, you know, I got dropped just before the election by the head of the Republican Party.
I've never been dropped in my life. And a woman came in who is a very successful person with a great family. And she took that thing over. What a job she's done. Her name is Jane Timken, and she is very special. Where's Jane? She's incredible. Thank you very much. And a man who said, oh, you're going to win, you're going to win, and I said, well, how do you know?
So I had five people to choose from to head up my campaign in Ohio. And one name, I don't know, I liked the name, I liked the sound of it, his name was Bob Paduchik. Why do I like that name? Why? It's not outstanding. But he came in and he did a job, and I had the support of the people, but not the support of a lot of others.
And he just said, you're going to win. And every time I called him up and say, you know, this happened, that happened, he said, that's OK, you're going to win by more. This guy's the most positive guy. So I want to thank Bob Paduchik. So good that we moved him over to the RNC, but, Bob, in about a year from now, get ready.
You're coming back here. Thank you, Bob. And we have a friend of mine who's an incredibly respected man in the United States Senate. When he speaks, we all listen, including the president. He really is. He's a great, great guy. He's loved in Ohio. Senator Rob Portman. Where is he? Thank you. He's a respected guy.
Thank you, Rob. Congressman Warren Davidson and Congressman Brad Wenstrup, thank you. Thank you, fellas. Great job. So many things we passed in Congress. Those two guys were there with us. Thank you very much. What a job they've done. We're also joined by your next lieutenant governor Jon Husted. Jon, thank you.
Thank you, Jon. And I hear you're up a little bit, Jon. We've got to get that over, because you're going against a very bad guy. I'll tell you, he's a bad guy. And everybody -- I'll tell you, Jon is with a friend of mine, and they decided to get together, which is very smart. Instead of going like this to each other, they got together, and Jon is running with your next governor, Mike DeWine... And Mike and Jon are running against Elizabeth Warren's far-left disciple, Richard Cordray.
Jon, am I allowed to say some bad things about Cordray? Because let me tell you, he did such a bad job at the agency that he ran. It was terrible. He was hurting people. And I think he enjoyed it. No, really. I really believe he enjoyed it. He was putting people out of business. They weren't loaning money to the people that they were supposed to. It was terrible.
Cordray spent $250 million federal dollars trying to renovate a headquarters, his agency, that they didn't even own, more than twice what the entire building was worth. They didn't own it. And then it became a big scandal. But because it was a Democrat, the fake news didn't want to write about it. Then after spending like $50 million on some elevators, it turned out that they didn't work.
If Cordray were ever -- and I'll tell you what, this is a Pocahontas dream to get this guy elected. [Audience Laughs] I can't believe -- you know, I know Ohio pretty well, right? I've done a lot for the steel industry. More than anybody's done in many, many -- I mean, you speak to U.S. Steel, they'll tell you.
A lot for the miners, a lot for everybody. This guy does not belong in the state, folks. OK? First of all, he's a super liberal. Why do you do that? Why do you do that -- is he -- OK, go with DeWine, please. And Jon. Cordray would be an absolute disaster for Ohio. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing.
I couldn't wait to get him out. We tried so hard. You know, you had one of these deals that you couldn't get him out. But we tried so hard. And they've done such a great job since we got him out. He was bad. You don't need him in Ohio. Now, I'm thrilled to introduce the next United States senator from Ohio, Jim Renacci, who's a great guy and a great friend of mine.
Jim, come up. Come up. Come. This is a good man. Nothing's easy about politics, but I'll tell you what, he's in there fighting, and just get out and vote for him. He is a good, good friend of mine and a good man.
Thank you, Mr. President. It's an honor to stand here with you tonight, like I stood with you 31 months ago when you were candidate Trump, and I told you I am with you. I told you I voted for you. I told you my wife voted for you, my family voted for you, my friends voted for you. Because we needed you to change Washington, and you haven't let me down.
Look, this crowd loves you. Ohio loves you. And we love what you're doing! You've got the Ohio economy growing. Unemployment is down. Wages are up. The tax cut and jobs bill is working in Ohio. You have two Supreme Court judges confirmed and more circuit judges confirmed than any other president. You've repealed the individual mandate that was hurting so many individuals here in Ohio, renegotiated NAFTA, helping Ohio business, passed right to try.
ISIS is on the run. And you have given our coal miners here in Ohio hope by reversing those devastating policies of the prior administration that had vowed to bankrupt that industry. Promises kept -- promises made, promises kept. Look, Mr. President, we are not tired of winning here in Ohio. And yet you've been able to do all that with no help from Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown.
He has fought you every turn, voting against the tax bill, voting against coal miners, voting against your judges' confirmations. You asked for help, and that's why I jumped in this race seven months ago. And I am here to help, just like Ohio, everyone here is here to help. Sherrod Brown votes 96 percent of the time with Chuck Schumer and 94 percent of the time with Elizabeth Warren.
Yet he voted 100 percent of the time with President Obama's judge appointments. He supported Hillary Clinton for president. [Audience Chants Lock Her Up] And -- and even though -- and even though you are ripping up those trade agreements that aren't working for Ohio, Senator Brown had the gall just a month ago to say the only thing President Trump has done for trade policy is run his mouth and line his pockets.
That's the type of guy who is not helping this president. Sherrod Brown is the fourth most liberal senator in the country. That's not Ohio. That's not even close to the average American. He votes like a Hollywood liberal, and he has received the most lobbyist money in the Senate, more than any other senator, he has received the most lobbyist dollars.
Look, it's time we send Sherrod Brown packing. And it's time we send me to Washington. Someone that's willing to help this president... [Audience Chants Drain the Swamp] In 25 days... In 25 days, in just 25 days, we need to retire Sherrod Brown. We need a red wave. We need a red -- not only a red wave -- and I said this earlier.
Mr. President, Ohio is going to deliver a red tsunami. Thank you for what you're doing, Mr. President. And thank you for what you've done for Ohio. Thank you.
Thank you. Thanks, Jim. It is true. Sherrod Brown's never voting for us. He didn't vote for anything that we want. Yet I hear he goes around -- he does the best commercials. In fact, I just want to think, is he a Republican? He's doing these commercials that he likes Donald Trump. He'll never vote for us. He didn't vote for Justice Kavanaugh.
He didn't vote for tax cuts. He doesn't vote for us, folks. I mean, it might be nice for him to say he agrees with my economic policy when he's never going to vote for it. So you're just kidding yourself. He voted yes on amnesty for illegal aliens. He voted yes on deadly sanctuary cities. We started building the wall, and we've made progress, but he voted against it. [Audience Chants Build the Wall] So illegal immigration takes American lives, American jobs, and American taxpayer dollars.
A border wall, which is moving faster than anybody would believe... is truly a life-saving barrier against deadly floods of drugs, crime, smugglers, traffickers, cartels. Our brave border agents want a wall. They need a wall. It's happening. It's moving. We have made so much progress. We will finish the wall.
If you want more jobs and less crime, if you want to stop Schumer from running the Senate... we need the vote of Jim Renacci. We do. Jim is a good person. He's a great guy. We need his vote! You know they say we have a majority. But if somebody has a cold, they can't come in, we don't have a majority anymore.
We got to get people. We've got to get some Republicans so we can vote. Finally, it's my privilege to introduce a tremendous Ohio Republican. We're here for him tonight. A great friend of mine, he's fought so hard for everything we've done. He's a true fighter for the state, Congressman Steve Chabot. Great guy.
Come up, Steve. Come up, Steve.
Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. President. And God bless Warren County! All right, yeah, all right. And God bless Hamilton County, too. I have Hamilton County. And Butler County, as well, and the Kentuckians. Oh, God bless you all. And God bless President Trump! Thank you. And I never knew I'd say this.
But God bless Kanye West! Hey, you know -- you know how many liberals it takes to screw in a light bulb? None, because they'd prefer to stay in the dark, so... [Audience Laughs] Let me just -- let me just say, I got like a -- I got about a six-page speech here. I decided the more Steve Chabot you get, the less President Trump you're going to get, so I'm not going to give this speech.
God bless you all, and God bless the President Trump!
Thank you, Steve. So just remember, a vote for Steve Chabot is a vote to protect your family, your jobs, and your country. Now, Steve's winning. Nice poll numbers. But don't take any chances. Get out and vote, please, OK? No chances. We don't want to hear about any upsets. He's a great, great guy. If you want to stop the radical Democrats, if you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker -- can you believe it -- and you have to get out and vote for Steve.
Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats have signed up for a socialist takeover of American health care that would utterly destroy Medicare and Rob our seniors of the benefits they paid into their entire lives. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and they've paid for it. And the Democrats want radical socialism, and they want open borders where everybody pours into our country.
It's what they want. I don't get it, but that's what they want. Does anybody want that? Open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. Think of that. I'll tell you what, the incredible men and women of ICE are not treated properly. They're not treated properly. They do an incredible job.
The Democrats want to turn America into a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens, MS-13 killers, and anybody else that wants to come in. We're not going to have it. We're not going to have it. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. This election is about safety and is about prosperity.
Since the election, which is incredible. If I would have said this, I've been to Ohio so many times, been to every part of Ohio. The people are great. But if I would have said this, the fake news would have said, how dare he say that. Since the election, we've created over 4.2 million new jobs... and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps.
Big deal. That's a big deal. We've added nearly 600,000 brand-new beautiful manufacturing jobs. Right? African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in the history of our country. And African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever, lowest rate ever. My -- that's a big number, right?
How do they beat that number? How does anybody beat that number? We're going to have these people come in. For over 100 years, they've claimed and they've wanted and they've said -- they've lied to African-Americans. Remember my statement, what do you have to lose? Guess what? They all believe it now. What do you have to lose?
They're doing -- we are doing great as a country. But I'm so proud -- I am so proud of the kind of numbers you're hearing. My administration is fighting every day to deliver safety, opportunity, and justice for everybody, for everybody. We're asking as an example all African-American voters to honor us with their support this November.
Get away from the Democrats. Get away from the Democrats. They've done nothing. They've done nothing. Think of it. We have the best numbers in history on employment and unemployment and median income and many other things. And I think we're going to get the African-American vote. And it's true. Kanye West, what he did was pretty amazing yesterday.
Pretty amazing. And you know who else was with him? A guy you know well, big Jim Brown. Big Jim. What do you think Big Jim would be making today in the NFL? He was unstoppable, right? Unstoppable Jim Brown. He was a great football player and is an even greater man. He's great. Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans likewise have the lowest unemployment in the history of our country.
And women unemployment just fell to 3.6 percent, which is soon to be changed to historic levels, but right now, I'm sorry, it's the lowest in 65 years, OK? Sorry! Sorry, women! I let the women down. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning, right? Tired of winning. Last week, I announced that we are replacing the horrendous NAFTA -- NAFTA was a disaster, folks -- NAFTA was a disaster -- with the incredible, brand-new, U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, the USMCA.
It's opening up Canada, opening up Mexico for our farmers, our -- everybody. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's unfair trade actions and trade abuses. And thanks to our tariff, and especially on steel that's been dumped all over this country, the Ohio steel industry and the U.S. steel industry is roaring back to life and soon will be hitting its most successful years ever.
Very serious. And you see it. You see it all over this state. Under Republican leadership, we passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. And by the way, Sherrod Brown voted against them. We reduced high-dose opioid prescriptions by 16 percent during my first year and now they're dropping much lower than that.
And I'll soon sign into the law the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis where just this year we got $6 billion from Congress -- thanks to Rob Portman and a lot of others -- thank you, Rob -- but Rob and so many others helped. Very little Democrat support. We also passed veterans' choice, the V.A. Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor and the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans, who we couldn't fire, we couldn't do anything about it, we now look at them and say, Jim, you're fired.
Out. Get out. True. True. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion for the second year to fully rebuild the American military, which had to happen. We needed it. And much less importantly, when it comes to the military, every bit of equipment is being built in the USA. That's the only place where jobs are secondary.
Number one, we needed the equipment. But it's all being built here. We make the greatest military equipment in the world. At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces called the Space Force. Very important. Very important. That's very important. Hate to say it, but very soon, that's where it's going to be at. It's going to be space, everything, defense, offense, everything.
And we have tremendous support from Rob and the Senate. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal, and look what happened to Iran. You know, when I took office, Iran was all over the place. They were taking over Syria. They were taking over Yemen. They were taking over everything.
I actually said, this is going to be a problem, and we've got to do something. And about four months ago, we withdrew from that horrible, ridiculous deal. And you take a look what's happening to Iran. There's riots all over the streets, all over the cities. It's a whole different ballgame. It's a whole different country.
And it's looking real good. Looking real good. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and reopened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Together, we've made unbelievable progress, and we're just getting started. We have so many other things. If you vote to elect Republican House, Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes very, very substantially.
We will protect Medicare and we will protect your Social Security. The Democrats cannot do it. We will continue to confirm judges who interpret the Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border. We will pass case law, crack down on sanctuary cities, end the visa lottery and chain migration, defend the ballot box for American citizens, and throw vicious MS-13 gangs the hell out of our country, like we're doing right now.
You know, I say it to people, MS-13 gang, vicious, horrible people. We're throwing them out of here by the thousands. But you know who's doing it? Do we love law enforcement or what? But you know who's... But ICE, in Long Island, where I sort of grew up -- I was right next to these areas. I know them so well.
You had towns that were practically taken over by MS-13. And ICE goes in like it's a day in the office. And they're tougher and smarter that these wise guys. And they start throwing them in the paddy wagon, throwing them in, get the hell out of here. And you know what? The towns are liberated. The people are clapping from windows.
The people are clapping all over the streets. These towns, like a country that was invaded and taken over and then was liberated. These towns are being liberated of the MS-13 garbage that came into our country. Under the previous administration, by the way. And they came in by the tens of thousands -- well, we have set every record on getting them out.
And I want to tell you, there's nothing that gives me more pleasure. And for all of the companies that are moving back in to the United States, we will finally have a merit-based system of immigration. Not just lump -- not a lottery, pick them out of a hat. Who the hell are they? Who is he? Pick them out of a hat.
We're letting people come in on merit, where they can help you, where they can help these companies grow. Right now, we have a system, lottery, a lottery. Think of it, lottery. Oh, pick 'em, I wonder? What people do you think these countries are putting in? Do you think they're putting in their finest? I don't think so. I don't think so. So we're going to end it. We're going to have a merit-based system.
Bring them in through merit. We're lifting millions of people from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. And you see that happening. But to achieve this, you have to get out November 6th or vote early and vote Republican. We need the votes. We have to have those votes. For years and years, you've watched as your leaders apologized for America.
They apologized for America. Now you finally have a president who is standing up for America. [Audience Chants USA] I have to tell you, I wish these fakers back there, the fake news, I wish they'd turn the cameras and show behind them, show outside these walls. Look at the people out there. It's amazing.
Look, they never turn the cameras. I go home, I say to my wife, how did the crowd look? They only show your face. They never move the camera. But you know what? She can tell by the sound, because... True. She can tell by the sound, because, you know, if you have, like, let's say, one of the normal presidents walk in. We've had a lot of normals.
And some great ones. You'd have, what, 300 people show up. But you can tell by the sound, because 300 people cannot make the sound of thousands and thousands and tens of thousands like that. They can't do it. So even though they refuse -- you know, normally I'd like it, but I don't. They don't want to move the camera.
The only ones that become famous are about six people right behind me. [Audience Laughs] They don't have the best seat in the house, but they're going to become the famous ones. No, but, honestly, you know, I know what stadiums sound like, and this sounds like on television we're in the middle of an Ohio State football game.
It's what it sounds like. It's what it sounds like. And speaking of Ohio State -- they're not doing too badly, are they, huh? Great coach. You have a great coach, great guy. Great guy. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Ohio. And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. But to continue our momentum, I need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and vote Republican, vote early or on November 6th, vote Republican.
Vote for Steve Chabot, Jim Renacci. Vote for DeWine. We need DeWine. We got to have DeWine. Where the hell is Jon? Are you over there, Jon? He's still here. He'll never leave. You got to vote. We need a governor here -- you cannot let this happen to Ohio. This Democrat is a disaster. A proven disaster. Vote DeWine.
He's a good man, and a good man, too. You've got two good men. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs, more wealth, more products made right now in the USA, which is what we're all about. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement.
Thank you, law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of hatred, anger, and division. You've seen that. You just saw it with a high-quality, highest quality, this incredible man. You saw it. Brett Kavanaugh, you saw it, what they did to him and his family. And his young, beautiful daughters.
Right? Da Nang Dick, Da Nang Dick, how about Da Nang? Da Nang Dick. Cory Booker, he ran Newark into the ground. Senator Dianne Feinstein, how about that? How about that? Seriously. [Audience Chants Lock her up] Who think that Dianne Feinstein leaked the papers? Who thinks... She was very unprepared for that question.
No, I didn't -- she was very unprepared, right? Very unprepared. Dianne Feinstein. You know, what they did to this man, he will go down along with Justice Gorsuch -- and, by the way, how good is Clarence Thomas? How good? How good? He's going to go down as one of your greats. It's up to the people in this incredible -- I don't know if you call it a room.
I don't know what the hell it is. All I know -- is this a room or a roof? I think it's a roof. Whatever it is, there are a lot of people. But it's up to you, folks. You have the power with your vote to defend your family, your country, your values, your faith, and to defend your dignity. So we had the greatest movement in the history of our country.
We really did. We really did. You know, they can say what they want, but nobody even challenges it. You know, I'll say that a lot. And usually, if there's, like, a 2 percent variation, the fake news will hit me the next day. Trump exaggerated or something. Actually, we've under-exaggerated, because we've produced more than I ever promised during the campaign.
More. But we had the greatest -- but look at the -- look at this. Look at this group. We had the greatest -- and we never -- by the way, I hate to disappoint you, but we went to Mississippi, we went to Missouri, we went to Nevada, we went to -- every place, and we have crowds, we have tens of thousands of people outside of every arena.
They have to start building larger arenas in this country, right? Something is happening. And I saw this in the election. We'd go -- I'll never forget -- we went to Michigan, final stop. I got there 1 o'clock in the morning. There was actually Election Day, 1 o'clock in the morning. There were 32,000 people.
I see some people there, they were there. It was unbelievable, 32,000 people. I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning. I got home at 4 o'clock in the morning. And I said, you know, we had 32,000. Crooked Hillary had, like, 500. And I said, why aren't we going to win the great state of Michigan? And guess what?
We did. We did. And it hadn't been won in decades by a Republican. And now they like me even more. You know why? Because car companies are moving plants back in. And just so you don't feel too lonely, they're moving the plants back into Ohio also. A lot of them. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country.
And together we are taking back our country. We're returning the power back to the incredible American people. Ohio is the state that gave us a great president who hasn't been properly recognized, OK? William McKinley has not been properly recognized. What he did in terms of trade, in terms of war, but in terms of trade -- and I hate to say, in terms of being smart in tariffs, William McKinley has not been properly recognized.
But maybe someday he will. It also gave you a general, who was incredible. He drank a little bit too much. You know who I'm talking about, right? So Robert E. Lee was a great general. And Abraham Lincoln developed a phobia. He couldn't beat Robert E. Lee. He was going crazy. I don't know if you know this story.
But Robert E. Lee was winning battle after battle after battle. And Abraham Lincoln came home, he said, I can't beat Robert E. Lee. And he had all of these generals. They look great. They were the top of their class at West Point. They were the greatest people. There was only one problem. They didn't how the hell to win.
They didn't know how to fight. They didn't know how. And one day, it was looking really bad. And Lincoln just said, you -- hardly knew his name -- and they said, don't take him. He's got a drinking problem. And Lincoln said, I don't care what problem he has, you guys aren't winning. And his name was Grant.
General Grant. And he went in and he knocked the hell out of everyone. And you know the story. They said to Lincoln, you can't use him anymore. He's an alcoholic. And Lincoln said, I don't care if he's an alcoholic. Frankly, give me six or seven more just like him. He started to win. Grant really did. He had a serious problem.
Serious drinking problem. But, man, was he a good general. And he's finally being recognized as a great general. But Lincoln had almost developed a phobia, because he was having a hard time with a true great fighter and a great general, Robert E. Lee. But Grant figured it out, and Grant is a great general, and Grant came from right here.
Ulysses S. Grant. Ohio is the state that gave us the Wright Brothers. It gave us Neil Armstrong. He's the man that planted the flag -- think of that -- on the face of the moon. Who's that? Who are they -- a relative of -- oh, that's nice. They weren't worried about not planting a flag, right? You know them.
He planted that flag, that American flag right on the face of the moon. There was no kneeling. There was no nothing. There was no games. There was no games. Boom. Wrong, right? Right, fellas? My military guys up here. Of course, my -- excuse me. Excuse me. My military folks all over this arena. And how do you like the fact that the V.A. now has choice, right?
I said it. But, you know, I skip over it. For 44 years, they've been trying to get choice, and we got it done. That means instead of waiting for 10 days or 5 days or 22 days or 33 days, or 2 months, our great veterans, some of them would be fine, just not feeling so good by the time they saw the doctor. It took so long, they would have a terminal illness.
That's how bad it was. And I got done what they'd been trying to do for 44 years, I think. Forty-four years. Now when they have to wait, they go out, they get the services of a good private doctor, we pay the bill, and they're all better, and that's nice. Forty-four years. It took 44 years to get that done.
I'm just saying that because I see these great military guys. That's pretty much appreciated, fellas, right? That's a big difference. It's a big difference. Made a lot of people very happy. Probably cost us less money. I don't care about that in this case. I care about taking care of our veterans. It's about time.
Generations of Ohio workers farm the fields, poured the incredible steel, fought the battles that made America into the most powerful and prosperous nation in the history of the world. We lost our way. But now we've gained our way back again, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. These courageous Ohio patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage.
We didn't do that. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. That's all we're going to do is win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down.
We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans. And our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
And together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Wow. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Ohio. I love Ohio. What a victory, what a victory. Remember these guys saying on television over and over again, "You cannot win unless you get with the great state of Ohio." We got this great state...
Remember they used to say that, "Trump can't get it because it all goes through Ohio." They didn't know that we're going to win by a lot. We won by a lot...
We won by a lot. But I'm thrilled to be back. This is an incredible place, and -- and we've done well. We've really produced. You know, last time I told you what we're going to do. Now you have the steel mills roaring again. You have people coming back into our country. You have all of these things happening...
It's much easier now. We have the greatest economy we've ever had. We have the best numbers. We're setting records in every respect, so it's much easier for me to do this than it was when I was campaigning when I said this will happen. This is a much easier situation.
It's an incredible time for our country. America is respected again and America is winning again... Because we are finally putting America first.
About time. Our economy is booming. Jobs are pouring back into our country. We're bringing them back. Those companies that left they want to come back. This is where the action is. We're protecting American workers, supporting American law enforcement...
Including ICE. ICE, we love ICE. [Crowd Chants Build the Wall] We're building that wall. We're building a wall, don't worry. We've already started. We've already started. We're building that wall. We've already started. We're doing a lot of things that people don't even know about.
We're defending our Constitution. We're taking care of our great vets. Our military will soon be stronger than it ever has been before. And the forgotten men and women of the United States are forgotten no more.
We are the great people. We are the great people. You work hard, you pay your taxes, you do all these things and you were forgotten. They forgot about you. And you're the smartest people, you're the smartest people.
You know what they talk about? They talk about the elite, the elite. Do you ever see the elite? [Booing] They're not elite. You're the elite. You are the elite. You're smarter than they are. You make bigger incomes. You've got everything going, you know. So let them keep calling us that. You ever hear it?
Hey, you go to the best schools. You do a tremendous job. Your own companies. You work for tremendous salaries. You do all the things that you do. You're talented with your hands, with your mind. And then you hear, "The elite has just said." The elite? [Laughter] They're more elite than me. I have better everything than they have, including this.
And I became president and they didn't, meaning you became president. And it's driving them crazy. We're honored to be joined this evening by many of your state's great leaders, including your next governor Mike DeWine who's terrific...
And your next United States Senator Jim Renacci. Great people, they're great people. And for the Senate we have to get Jim. We just have to get him in because ... Senator Brown is not going to vote for our judge. We have a great judge. We love Justice Gorsuch. Now we have soon-to-be Justice Kavanaugh. We need both.
We need Jim Renacci. [Crowd Chants We Want Jim] So vote for Jim. We got to get Jim in there. He's a very important guy. Also here with us tonight is Ohio Speaker of the House Ryan Smith. Ryan, thank you. Thank you, Ryan. Ohio Senate President Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you. RNC Co-chair Bob Paduchik, Bob, I love Bob, I love Bob. You know, Bob Paduchick ran my campaign in Ohio. You know that, right?
And he was recommended along with five or six people and they were all recommended. And I sort of said, "I don't know." But one person said something about him that I liked. They said he never quits, he never gives up.
And Bob Paduchik, I didn't have the governor's support. I didn't have senator support. I didn't have your head of the Republican Party support other than that he's doing very well. [Booing] But Bob said, "It doesn't matter because you have the people's support," he said though. And you remember that great night in November...
When they said, after hearing so much about Ohio, and it is true you have to win Ohio. And they said, "It's going to be close. He's going to be able to win maybe by two if he's lucky." That would mean it would take all night they wouldn't be able to say a thing, and they announced, "The polls are closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio." Come up here, Bob, come up.
I never -- he never stops, and now he's working with Troy and he's doing good. You just said, "He's going to be winning, Bob." When he says he's going to win -- I think we won by 11 points or something, Bob, right, 11? Oh, 8-1/2, well, that's ... [Laughter]
We'll take that, we'll take that. Did you have to be so accurate, Bob? [Laughter] Eight and a half points, we love Ohio. We love it. And I'll tell you what, we're going to have a tremendous victory for Troy, Troy Balderson.
And he's the one I wanted to win. They had this false report that I was supporting somebody else, and they were right. It was fake news, you're right, so. And I was supporting somebody else, Steve Stivers, but he's in a totally different district. [Laughter] Did they apologize? Did you apologize for them to say, no, I heard today - I heard today... [Crowd Boos and Chants]
So, no, I did. I heard that -- you know, that Troy was like my second choice. I said, He's my first choice. He's always been the one I wanted to win, and it's always dangerous when you do this. You know, you get involved in the primary. He thinks -- although I have done very well. They don't say -- they don't say our record in the primaries. They give us a lot of false records.
Katie Arrington, South Carolina, she was behind by a lot and she's fantastic, by the way, she's fantastic. And we endorsed her, and she beat a man that likes flamenco dancers from Argentina. You know about that. He was supposed to be vacationing on the Tallahassee Trail, but he was actually in Argentina. [Laughter]
I don't know. Jim, do they have a Tallahassee Trail in Argentina? I don't think, right? No? No, right? Jim Jordan, how great is he? How great is he? How great is he? Hey, come here, Jim. Come here, come here.
Thank you. The -- the -- the President is a little taller than me. [Crowd Chants Speaker of the House]
And -- thank you.
Think about this, in 18 months, regulations reduced, taxes lowered, Gorsuch on the court, economy growing at a record rate, unemployment at its lowest in 20 years, Kavanaugh is on deck on the court, we're out of that crazy Iran deal. The -- the embassy is going to Jerusalem and the hostages have been returned from North Korea. That's what's happened under the President's leadership. Thank you very much.
What a great defender he's been, what courage. I'll tell you what. There's a brave tough cookie along with some of his friends. They are -- they are -- you know, I just look -- I didn't know he was going to be here. I looked over and said, "I don't want to wrestle him. He's tough." [Laughter]
I think he's like 128 in one or something crazy like that. Did you ever win in this room, Jim? Did you ever wrestle in this room? You would've won. [Laughter] Statistically, you would've won. [Laughter] Anyway, thanks, Jim, for being -- I didn't know you're going to be here. That's great. Thank you, man.
So, a woman -- a woman, a fantastic woman who came to me because, you know, I didn't have the head of the Republican Party on my side. I won't mention Matt's name. [Laughter]
I was so nice to him, you're not go along and I talked, and I introduced him, his family, his wife, everybody was nice. And then one day, I heard he wasn't going to be with us. And I went, you know, to Paduchik. I said, "What do you think?" He said, "Your poll numbers are now going to go up."
But what happened is we decided, after I won the presidency, we decided, "Let's challenge this guy. Why should we allow that to happen?" And Jane Timken came along, and she was unyielding. She challenged him. And as you know, a lot of people were trying to push him over the line. That didn't work out too well because Jane Timken won that race, and she has been an incredible GOP State Chairman. Thank you, Jane. Come up. Thank you, Jane. She's been incredible actually.
Finally, it is my true honor to introduce the person that we're here for tonight. He's really tough, he's really smart. He never stops working. That's what Paduchik told me. I said, "How is he doing?" He said, "This man, he loves the people of Ohio. He loves the people in this district. He never ever stops."
It's Ohio's 12th district, and he's going to hopefully be here for a long time. He's never going to let you down. I'll tell you, I see it, I see it. And that's why we're so angry when they said that I was supporting Steve Stivers. And I was -- but again it's the wrong district, I support both of them. [Laughter]
So I expected a big apology. I thought it was going to be -- I won't mention the one because actually sometimes they treat me OK, but about four percent of the time. [Laughter]
But I said to a group, "Well, they'll be apologizing today." I said, "Did they apologize?" I didn't see the apology, but that's OK because let me tell you, right from the beginning, Troy Balderson, he is the guy, he is the guy that's going to do things. And you're going to be very surprised. You know, they're talking about this blue wave. [Booing]
I don't think so, I don't think so. Maxine Waters is leading the charge. [Booing] Maxine, she's a real beauty, Maxine. A seriously low I.Q. person, seriously.
Maxine Waters, she's leading the charge. You know, all throughout like hundreds of -- like 100 years, I guess, 125 years, whoever has the White House, that party tends to lose the midterms. I don't know why. Maybe it's complacency, maybe you all fight so hard for the presidency and, you know, you win and you're a little complacent, but I mean that was two years ago. So I just said why.
But we have the greatest economy in the history of our country. We have things that have never happened before. And look, if the Democrats get in, they're going to raise your taxes, you're going to have crime all over the place, you're going to have people pouring across the border. So why would that be a blue wave? I think it could be a red wave. I tell you what -- really, I think it should be a red wave.
But you got to get out and do it, you got to get out and vote. You got to get out because they want to take away what we've given. They want to take away -- did you ever see this? I mean, you see Pelosi who, by the way, again controls Danny O'Connor, whoever the hell that is, but, you know ... [Booing] Danny O'Connor.
And Danny O'Connor, on his resume, put stuff that wasn't true, OK? So he did that. You know, he would have thought he was Perry Mason or something. He was like a low-level person that did nothing. Danny O'Connor, that's a beauty. He's another beauty.
This is what we're fighting. They will take away your taxes. They will destroy so many things that we've given. And you know, by the way, we had Obamacare repealed and replaced except for one man who showed up at two o'clock and he voted no, he went no.
But what we've done on health care is incredible. We've kept your numbers way down, way below what they thought. We've taken away the individual mandate, which is the single worst part of Obamacare.
We've taken it away. And you know, I mean, look, hey this has been -- this has been some successful period for our country. Our country has never ever been like this. Levels of enthusiasm, the likes of which nobody's ever seen, they've never seen it in the polls not for me, in the polls.
So, so we have a man that's going to fight for you. He's going to fight for Ohio and he's going to be here for a long time. He will never ever disappoint you. I found that out from the people -- you know, he's just not going to disappoint you. He's really smart and he's a really hard worker. Troy Balderson, come on up.
Thank you, thank you everyone. It's a great honor to be here. But before we get started, how about we wish the United States Coast Guard a happy 228th birthday. And to all the men and women who serve and have served, let's give them a roaring sound of applause.
Thank you. For a guy from Muskingum County, an area I call the Shaker Heights of Appalachia, it is truly a humble experience to be on stage with President Trump.
Mr. President, welcome back to Ohio, and we're thankful to have you here. And thank you to everyone here today. I am humbled by your support. It's been overwhelming.
In 2016, Ohio was the battleground for the presidential election. Your countless volunteer hours, your enthusiasm and most importantly, your vote helped put Donald J. Trump in the White House.
On August 7th, we need to do that again. I'm counting on all of you again. I need your volunteer hours, your enthusiasm and most importantly, I need your vote August 7th so I can go to Congress [Applause] And represent you and fight alongside this good man, this great man, President Trump, to make America great again.
In just a short period of time since his election, President Trump has lowered taxes, brought unemployment to an all-time low, and the stock market is roaring. I'm going to fight alongside him to continue this economic success, I promise. To the seniors out there, including my mom and dad, and they're here today [Applause]
And the seniors across America, President Trump will protect your Social Security and Medicare, and I'll fight alongside him to make sure the benefits you were promised are there for you.
Mr. President, we don't want to go back. I'm not tired of winning. My opponent has a different idea though, dishonest Danny O'Connor wants to repeal those middle-class tax cuts. [Booing] Dishonest Danny O'Connor wants to take away your guns. [Booing] Dishonest Danny supports open borders and sanctuary cities. [Booing]
Dishonest Danny O'Connor will fight against the policies that are turning our country around. [Booing] And worst of all, dishonest Danny O'Connor will vote for Nancy Pelosi for Speaker. [Booing]
If you want someone who will fight for President Trump economic agenda that is putting America back to work, then I need your help, and I need your vote on Tuesday. I will win this election on August 7th and go to Congress to fight for Ohio and for the great people of the 12th District. Thank you all very much. Thank you. God bless America. Thank you, Donald Trump.
Thank you. He means it, he means it, he means it. Thank you, Troy. Thank you, Troy. A vote for Troy's opponent is a vote for open borders, which equals massive crime, like they don't care about it. They don't care about the crime. They don't care about your military and they don't care about your vets. [Booing]
The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE and let's not worry about crime. Oh, really? It doesn't work that way. [Booing] You know, when MS-13 sees the ICE people, when they come in MS-13 says, "We got problems, we got problem." ICE is fantastic for this country. They're brave. They got a tough job.
And we're getting these gangs like MS-13 and others, we get them the hell out of the country one by one getting them out. A vote for Danny Boy and the Democrats is a vote to let criminals and drugs pour into our country and to let MS-13 run wild in our communities. And you know what they do once they're there? We're going to protect our law enforcement, not just ICE, all of our law enforcement.
Republicans want a maximum, and we do. We want maximum border security and respect for ICE, respect for Border Patrol, respect for all of our great law -- right, right, law enforcement offices.
All of them, law enforcement offices. We've seen the horrors that happened when our laws are not enforced. For example, in the sanctuary state of California, Air Force veteran Marilyn Farris was viciously raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history who should have never been in our country, including an arrest just a week before he killed Marilyn.
This was somebody that should have never been allowed to be in our country. And we're talking about thousands of people. We're talking about thousands and thousands of people.
You can ask Jim Jordan. That's all we work on. That's what we focus on, and we're finally getting there. We're finally -- we'll get there, we'll get there. We want our country to be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. [Crowd Chants Build that Wall]
Every day, the heroes of ICE are tracking down the violent criminals, drug dealers, child predators, which is a tremendous problem, and the vicious gang members all over the place and we're throwing them in jail or throwing them the hell out of our country, one or the other. And we just announced yesterday a record of enforcement at the border.
Not easy, it's not easy because our laws are so bad, they're so pathetic, catch and release. Visa lottery, lottery, let's pick somebody out. Oh, darling, I wonder who that might be. Oh, here he is. [Laughter]
Oh, oh, he's convicted of five murders. Oh, I see. Well, let him run through our country. We are -- what we're doing is crazy. And how about chain migration? How about that? [Booing]
Somebody comes in, he brings his mother, and his father, and his aunt and uncle, 15 times removed. He brings them all. I said the other day, the young man, we call him that or the young animal, I guess is better -- who -- who mowed down eight people, killed many people horribly. Did you ever notice they never talk about the people that lose arms and legs? They never talked about that. They talk about eight people died, but they don't say eight people died and many people lost their arms and their legs and they'll never be the same. They worked so hard. They're so incredible.
But this guy had 22 people come in with him -- 22 people. And he's in our justice system now. He's been there for about a year. It'll take forever. We better get smart, we better get tough and smart. Take forever court after court after court, and then they end up making deals.
If you want to have a border, if you want to stop the radical Pelosi and Waters -- Maxine Waters agenda, there's only one choice in this election, that's vote for Troy Balderson. He's going to help Mark Meadows. He's going to help Vince, he's going to help Jim. He's going to help everybody. They're going to get the job done.
I mean, the fact is we need more Republicans. People say we have a majority. We don't really have the majority of the Senate. Fifty-one, we have one person not voting, you know, not around to vote. I don't know he's not -- he's not voting, so we have 50.
You know to get -- I'll give you an example how tough it is. To get our great future Justice Kavanaugh, I think he's going to get there, too. I feel strongly about it. But to get him approved think of this, because we have one vote that won't be able to vote, unfortunately, to get Justice Kavanaugh approved, we need 100 percent of the Republican votes. Think of that. How bad is that?
How do you get a 100 percent of anything? You know, you always have somebody. I don't like Trump, I don't like our president. He destroyed my career. I only destroyed a career because they said bad things about me and you fight back and they go down the tubes and that's OK. A couple of them, a couple of them. It's all right. I never mentioned names, I don't mention names. I've become much more diplomatic.
See, in the old days, a year ago, two years ago, I would have mentioned names. I don't do that anymore. I don't do it anymore. But think of it, we need a 100 percent, and then the Vice President -- Mike Pence is a great guy -- has to vote ... And has to go and raise his hand, and we -- we win.
But, you know, you're not going to have that vote most likely from your senator, but it's one of those things we're going to get them in. Top at Yale, top at Yale Law School. Same thing with Justice Gorsuch, top at Harvard, number one in his class, Harvard Law School. Went to Oxford, top student. I mean, this is what we want. We want great people. We want really top-of-the-line smart people. I want people with the highest test scores. I like high test scores. Does that make sense?
I want them. I want people, so do you. So we have somebody great in Brett Kavanaugh, and I think it's working out very well. But we need 100 percent of the vote.
Now we have a couple of places where I won by 30 and 40 points, and it could very well be that they come and vote for our senators, Democrats, could very well be. We'll see what happens. But on the assumption that they don't, because they do talk, a few of them say nicer things than -- about me than any Republican. A couple of them compare me to some of the greats. I talk about Abe Lincoln, Honest Abe. No.
No, they say great things. And I tell the people, I tell the people, I say it's wonderful that they say nice things, but they're never going to give us the vote, they'll never. We need the vote. Say bad things about me, but give the vote. [Laughter]
And I'm not just talking vote on justices, I'm talking votes on lots of other things, including highways, and infrastructure, and the wall and border security.
I need their vote, and we're never going to get their vote. The only way we'll get their vote, we need more Republicans, OK? We got to get more Republicans or it's going to see -- you will see this country go down so fast. You know, what we've done is they even say it really has been, as you say, amazing. It's been a miracle to a lot of people, it's been a miracle because I campaigned.
And I purposely didn't mention the kind of numbers that we're achieving because I didn't want to be accused of exaggeration, right, by the fake news media.
If I would have said 4.1 percent GDP, they would have -- it would have been major headlines like -- and by the way, it's going a lot higher. You can mark my words what's going on.
You know, if I get the trade deficits down they never tell you this, if I get the trade deficits down, bring them down. If I bring the trade deficits down, we could pick up three and four points in GDP. Nobody says that, nobody says that.
They think we can't go any higher. We can go much higher. We have to have good trade deals. We're doing this despite horrible trade deals, the worst deals ever made in the history of our country, ever made in the history of the world. Nobody ever made deals where we give away our country to other countries. It's sheer stupidity. And now these countries, because of tariffs, and I say that's OK.
You know, President Obama, it wasn't his thing. It wasn't his thing. [Booing] Frankly, it wasn't anybody's thing for the last 30 years, it wasn't anybody's thing. It's my thing. I love it, I love it.
But we had one set of countries. European Union, look, they're excellent. They want to make a deal. They're dying to make a deal. They want to make a deal. But for years, you know, they tell President Obama, "No, no, we have no interest in meeting. We have no interest in meeting." And I guess they said, oh, that's OK, but they said that to me, too.
Sir, we really don't want to meet. We're happy with the deal. They should be happy. They made $151 billion dollars last year, they should be very happy. I said, "I agree, you shouldn't meet. I agree you shouldn't change the deal, but you're going to have to." They said, "Well, we really don't want to meet." I said, "OK, that's OK, don't meet. But as your cars come into the United States -- Mercedes, BMW, many others -- we're going to tax them 20 percent and we're going to do a lot better."
And then they said, like about 12 minutes after it was announced, "You have a call." I'm not going to embarrass people's names because I like Jean-Claude, OK? [Laughter] So I won't mention his name. But he did call and he said, "We'd like to meet." [Laughter]
And we have the makings of a deal, but without that there was no chance. And then I have senators coming, and others and congressmen. I don't think I'll ever hear from Troy on this. I don't think I'll ever hear. But they go -- please don't tax the stuff coming into our country.
What they're doing to our country is incredible. We had an $817 billion dollar trade deficit among all countries over the last number of years. Think of it, per year, per year, $817 billion. That's a year. Do you think they're good trade deals? Oh, wonderful deal, whoever negotiated those deals. And it's going down.
You know, a number that they don't want to talk about, but the number 4.1 was great, but we're going to go a lot higher than that, 4.1 was great. Once the trade deals -- you know if I didn't do anything with the trade deals, if I said nothing, you know, let everybody continue to take our jobs, take our wealth, let them continue, you know, I'll bet our stock market is up almost 40 percent since I won.
But if I didn't do anything with trade just kept quiet, let them continue to take advantage of us, nobody says anything. I think you would have been up another 40, 50, 60 percent.
But eventually you would have had to pay the piper eventually, and we're not going to do that, we're going to do something, we're going to make our country so much richer than it's ever been.
And I don't like it when congressmen and senators come up to me -- because I'm a free trader and I'm a fair trader, fair being more important, and I'm a reciprocal trader. You know what reciprocal is? If they do it, we do it, right? What's wrong with that? But I don't like it.
When a senator, who I like, and there are a number of them or when a congressperson who I like comes into the White House Oval Office, they want to see me, "Sir, we'd really like you to stop treating these countries so bad." I said, "We have a tremendous massive deficit. We're losing a lot of money." "It doesn't matter, Sir. We believe in free trade." I said, "OK, let me ask you a question. They're charging us a 50 percent tariff. We're charging them a 20 percent tariff. Do you think that's OK?" "No, Sir, it's really not. We want free trade." I said, "What's free when they charge us so we can't charge them." What is going on here? What's going on here? It's unbelievable, you know, it's unbelievable.
When we make a car and we send it to China, they charge us a 25 percent tax. When they make a car and send it to us, we charge them essentially nothing. It's 2.5 percent, but basically they don't pay it. So they pay -- think of it, they pay 2.5 percent, meaning nothing. We pay 25 percent. And on top of it they don't want our cars, OK? That's even worse.
So what they do is they say, "No, no, we don't want your cars," but they tell General Motors, "Build the plants in China." I don't blame them. Look, I don't blame China, I don't blame any of these countries. I don't have to go through them. I've got some good relationships. Believe it or not, they all like me. They understand. They can't believe themselves they got away with it.
They can't believe they -- that they got away with, but they have and we're turning it around, we're turning it around fast, you know, sadly because I don't like this. But the Chinese market is down 27 percent in the last three or four months, 27. I don't like that because I really like President Xi and I respect China greatly. It's incredible what they've done.
But they've done it off our back. They've taken $500 billion a year for many years -- $500 billion. We have really rebuilt China and we rebuilt, and it's time that we rebuild our own country now, OK?
And Troy Balderson is going to help me do that, right, Troy? Troy, yes. OK, he said yes. If he said no, I'm out of here, OK? [Laughter] He's going to help us. He's going to -- believe me he'll be there. He'll be in the forefront.
We've now created 3.9 million jobs -- think of that -- since the election. I would have never said it because of the fakers back there. I would have never said it.
I would have never -- can you imagine if I said that with the fake news? Let's say we're campaigning. Nobody ever heard me say we're going to -- almost four million jobs -- four million. And by the way, you have car plants moving into Michigan, moving in [Applause] Moving into Ohio, moving into Pennsylvania, massive, massive companies. Moving into South Carolina, moving into North Carolina, they're all coming back and that means jobs.
And you know what? When I charge them, when I say, look, 20 percent, I'll keep it down to a minimum 20 percent because I'm a nice person. It totally wipes out the deficit. We go positive, we make a lot of money. And you know what they're going to do, they're not going to pay the 20 percent, they won't pay it too much. In fact, the higher I make it the better it is. You know why? They're going to come to Ohio and build a plant because that way they pay nothing, right? They pay nothing.
They're going to build their plants in this country. I went to the Wharton School of Finance, I was a very fine student. And I will tell you, one of the great schools in the world, the Wharton School of Finance, one of the hardest schools in the world to get into. I got in -- let me tell you, I went there.
This is basic, so basic. We charge them a lot, we put in a 20 or 25 percent tax. We take the 151 and now we make 100, so we flipped it like $250 billion with one signature. But what's going to happen? They're coming into the United States to build their plants. Don't even think about it, OK [Applause] Because they're not going to pay that tax. Too much.
More Americans are now employed. Here's one of the greatest -- here is one of the best statistics ever. More Americans are now employed than ever recorded before in our nation's history.
Think of that. So we have more people employed working today than the United States has ever had employed or working, think of that. Is that incredible? That's like this little statement that they put out. Nobody -- they don't want you to hear this stuff. This is the great thing, so these rallies are very successful. They hate when I do them although they do like the ratings, I must say. [Laughter]
You know they're torn, they're torn. Do we put them on and get great ratings and let him say that like CNN is a fake or ... Or do we not put him on? They're very torn.
It's oftentimes I'm getting ready to do my -- you know, the fake news with CNN and MSN -- MSNBC is so corrupt. It's so disgusting... [Booing] So disgusting. I would say almost they're worse, they're almost worse, they're really a fake news group of people.
And here's the good news, the guys that we love, right, they're blowing them away in their ratings. Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson, Steve Doocy, Ainsley, Brian, so many others, they're blowing up away in their ratings. Oh, excuse me, I almost forgot, I would have been in big trouble, the great Lou Dobbs, right? I ordered it. But you see -- oh, Maria Bartiromo.
Great. I'm in trouble because I -- I know I left out probably 10, but I didn't -- I didn't really think I'd be doing this, but they're blowing up away. CNN is down at the bottom of the totem pole. MSNBC isn't even close to being next to these shows. So we're blowing them away and that's good because those are the people that love us. That's why we're going to win. I mean, we're going to win here. It's why -- it's why I won my election, remember?
Now, three or four polls got it right, but for the most part, you know, it's suppression. They want to convince you that Trump has no chance so you don't bother voting. You go to a movie then you come home. But the problem is you never went to the movie, you went out and voted.
Beautiful, right? Right, right? You went out and voted. Darling, let's go to a movie because CNN, fake news, said Trump will not win because there is no path to 270. There is a path to 306 but not the 270.
No, I was saying the other night, remember? Pennsylvania, I was ahead by a lot. We only had two points left. It was like 9:30, it was early. And they refused to say that I won Pennsylvania. If I lost every single remaining vote, it was impossible to catch me.
I kept saying, "Well, wait a minute, there's only so many votes left and we would have to do three times that number. Why aren't they saying?" So then what happened is Wisconsin came in, and we won the state of Wisconsin, and we won the state of Michigan. And then they finally announced Pennsylvania. You know why? They couldn't stand it because they're so dishonest. These are -- these are among the most dishonest human beings you will ever meet. [Booing]
In the month of July alone, we added nearly 40,000 new manufacturing jobs. We've created nearly a half a million manufacturing jobs since I took office. And you remember what they used to say? Oh, there are no manufacturing jobs, they don't exist anymore. They're no good. Really? How do you make things without manufacturing jobs? I guess, they figure you'll buy it from the competitors, right? You'll buy it. We'll go out and buy it.
No, we're doing manufacturing jobs at numbers that people haven't seen before. Half a million almost, in fact, probably, by the time I leave this room, it'll be over half a million.
Our economy is soaring, and we're creating opportunity for everyone. The unemployment rate for Americans without a high school diploma -- this just came out two days ago, and I figure I might as well tell you because they won't say it. Without a diploma, high school is at the lowest level ever recorded, right. How good is that?
Economic growth last quarter hit 4.1, you all know that. You all know this, too. Remember, I used to say because they always voted Democrat, it was like automatic. The African-American unemployment rate has achieved the lowest level ever recorded in history.
I've never heard them say that. Have you ever heard them say that? I say it. That's the advantage of having something where a lot of people are listening. Oh, do they listen to those [Inaudible].
And then what they do, do you ever notice on Monday morning or Sunday morning they'll take a beautiful long flowing statement and they'll cut it out just a few words in the middle. And I say, "Man, they really changed the meaning of what I was saying." These are really bad people. The Hispanic unemployment rate is at the lowest level in history.
The Asian unemployment rate has also achieved the lowest level ever recorded. The women's unemployment rate -- I am so sorry, Women, I've let you down. I've let the women down even though I won the women, I won the women, oh.
You know, when those numbers came how is it possible because I never heard I was going to win the women. I said, "I think the women like me." My wife, the First Lady, Melania said, "The women really like you."
They do like me, and I like them. But I said, "How did we win the women?" We won the women. I was a little -- that was a little surprise to a lot of people, but now that you've been to the rally, look at all those pink posters.
Well, thank you. So, the women's unemployment rate is not the lowest ever recorded, it's only the lowest level in 65 years. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry 65 years. But we think by the next report we should have the lowest in history. The veterans, do I love the veterans, unemployment rate [Applause] Reached lowest level in nearly 20 years, almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps and that's since the election.
That means they're getting out, they're working, they're loving their life, they're getting jobs that pay them much more than what they can make any other way. That's some number. That's a big number -- all for food stamps. And our new workforce initiative will deliver job training to more than four million Americans, and it's growing. And even though it's 110 degrees in this crazy room ... If you can take it, I can take it.
In all fairness to the HVAC engineers and contractors, this room was not designed quite for this crowd. And you people are hot. So, if anybody wants to leave, leave, there's a lot of people out that want to get in, but don't leave. Now it is -- it is rather hot. Here's the good news. You walk out, you lose about ten pounds and you say, "That was really very good. That was...
That beats going to a gym, right? And it's hot. So much for my brand-new beautiful suit. Now that we have the best economy in the history of our country, this is the time to straighten out the worst trade deals ever made by any country on earth at any time. Ohio alone lost over 200,000 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO. The WTO World Trade Organization a total disaster.
For decades our politicians allowed other countries to steal our jobs, plunder our wealth and loot our economy. That's what they did. I don't think for the most part they did it consciously, they just didn't know what the hell they were doing. They had no idea. And then you have the globalists who think that is wonderful when they close up a plant in Ohio, move the plant to Mexico or some other place, lose all of your jobs. They make the product in Mexico or some other country, send it back into our country tax-free -- those days are ending -- tax-free. Right? No good, no. We don't like that. We want our people.
Did you see a certain gentleman the other day said, "Donald Trump doesn't take care of foreign workers." I said, "He's right." [Booing] That was Charles Koch, Charles Koch who's actually a nice guy. They're members of my clubs, David and Charles Koch. But he said, "Donald Trump doesn't take care of foreign workers." I said, "Hey, he's right." I mean, [Inaudible]. I don't want to get into an argument, he's right. I want to take care of the American workers. I want to be America first, OK?
But America's economic surrender ended the day that I took office, folks. Now after years of rebuilding foreign countries, we are finally rebuilding our country.
The great patriot from Ohio -- and he was indeed and he was actually a great president, certainly from an economic standpoint. He was a great president. He was assassinated. People don't realize William McKinley from Ohio was a great president.
He understood the crucial importance of tariffs in maintaining a very strong country. And people that followed him went down as great presidents because one, in particular, as you know, because he was given an economic behemoth that was created by McKinley. McKinley said, "We ought to take care of our own nation and her industries first. We have to take care of our nation first."
And we can help other people, we want to help other people. But we don't want to help other people that are rich and not have them reimburse us. It's so foolish. We're taking care of their military. We're taking care of their -- we're taking care of everything.
You know, a lot of these deals were made many years ago when they were weak and struggling, and then we never changed them. We never changed them. They're still the same old deal. But we're changing them now ... Changing them now. And Troy Balderson is going to be helping so much.
Thanks to our pro-American economic policies, Americans Steel -- one of the things I'm most proud of -- American Steel is making one of the biggest comebacks that anybody has ever seen for any industry.
Nucor, big great steel company, you know, the steel mills were all closing, they're all closing up. Nucor has announced an $85 million dollar upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced a new $150 million dollar steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights.
JSW Steel is restarting the furnace and investing $500 million dollars in Mingo Junction, and Cleveland-Cliffs announced a new $700 million plant in Toledo.
United States Steel is building or renovating or improving over seven new plants. They never thought they'd see a day when this happened. And this all happened within a very short period of time because we've stopped the dumping. If they want to dump, you know what, that's fine, but they have to pay a 25 percent tax. It's amazing what impact that has on people that want to rip off and destroy our industries.
Thank you very much, I appreciate that. We've also taken historic action to protect our amazing farmers. I reached a historic agreement with the European Union. We talked about them before to reduce barriers to American-grown products and vastly increase the purchases of Ohio's number one crop, American soybeans. And by the way, do you see the prices? They're starting to go up.
Soybeans prices are starting to go up. And we're standing up to China -- we'll get along with China, but we're standing up because it's just been unfair. We've authorized up to $12 billion to help American farmers during this period of time where China is targeting the American farmer because China is smart and they know the American farmers love Donald Trump. And they say, "What can we do to stop Donald Trump because finally, he's the guy. He got it right. He's bringing the wealth back to the United States." And China doesn't like it, so they're spending a fortune on public relations and ads.
Do you ever see these ads? Look at who's paying from, and other countries and by the way, other countries. And speaking of John, it's just come out that the Democratic leader and the leader of the Russian investigation ... [Booing] Dianne Feinstein had a Chinese spy as her driver for 20 years, and she's leading the Russian investigation if that's what you call it. How about leading -- no, no, she's leading the Russian witch-hunt, a Democrat-inspired witch-hunt. That's something. Isn't that something?
Dianne Feinstein had a Chinese spy. How come China never spies on us? Can I tell you what? There are those that say, "Boy, they're brutal. You should ask the people. Ask what's going on." And not only China, it's a lot of people and we got to stop it. We got to stop meddling. We got to stop everybody from attacking us, but there are a lot.
Russia is there. China is there. Hey, we're doing well with North Korea, but they're probably there. We got to stop everybody. We got to stop. But think of that, and I like Dianne Feinstein. I have to tell you, but I don't like the fact that she had a Chinese spy driving her, and she didn't know it. And then she says to me, "Well, what did you know about this?" And I mean, give me a break. Come on, folks. [Laughter]
Every day -- and by the way, with China not doing so well, it's only gotten worse. I guarantee you. If there's any meddling or if there's any problems, I guarantee it's going to happen really big now because we are taking our wealth back, we're taking our jobs back, we're opening up markets.
Every day we're setting new records and we're keeping our promise. We have eliminated a record number of job-killing regulation. We have -- and that is so true. And Ohio is going to like this. We have ended the war on clean coal. Our miners are back to work, clean coal.
Republicans passed the biggest tax cuts in reform in American history. We've saved our family farms from the estate tax, also known as the death tax. And also we've saved small businesses, small farms. Small businesses won't be paying the death tax anymore.
As I said, we've repealed the core of Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone. That's where you pay a tremendous amount of money for the privilege of not having to pay to buy terrible, horrible health care that's way overpriced. We have given you a lot of health care plans that you can choose from through associating health plans. We're giving businesses the greatest ability that they've ever had to join forces to buy much better health insurance for much less money including across state lines.
And we've just added and introduced a brand new rule to offer renewable plans that could save patients 50 percent or more compared to Obamacare -- Obamacare. That was a beauty, Obamacare. It was repealed and replaced, remember, other than one vote.
And you know what else we did, which is I think really great, it's really something. When you're really sick, it's called right to try. How many times you know somebody [Applause] And you're reading about this potential cure but it'll be 10 more years of experiments in food and drug, and we have right to try now. People sign a disclaimer, they sign an agreement for no liability.
And instead of traveling, if they have the money, most people don't have the money, but I know people they've traveled all over the world to try and solve a health problem. Right to try, it's passed. It was really tough. You wouldn't think it will be tough.
But the health care companies had a problem, the pharmaceutical companies had a problem. Our country, because everybody is worried everybody would be sued, I said, "You'll sign an agreement where nobody, you know, you do it. You don't sue people. You -- they want to get better, they want to have a right to try." We approve that, and that's a big thing. It was a very hard thing. They've been trying to get it for 40 years.
I signed it into law three months ago -- right to try. So if they have something that you read about that looks really promising, you don't have to wait 12 years. You know one of the reasons you couldn't use it because they said, "Well, we don't want to use it because maybe it's going to hurt somebody." Well, the people are going to die. They want to try it. It might not work and it might work.
It's also a great test medically, it's a great test. So right to try, we have it. I'm so proud of that one. To restore our security we increased defense spending to $700 billion this year and $716 billion next year. We're doing things that we've never done before. And we also had approved $6 billion for opioid. We're fighting opioid. It's down 20 percent. It's a tough fight.
$6 billion we got approved. Thanks to our 2$ billion investment in new armored vehicle, workers at the legendary tank plant in Lima, Ohio, are now back on the job, churning out M1 Abrams tanks. Do you like that, Abrams tanks?
They're churning them out. You know the great thing about what we're doing with $700 billion and $716 billion, we also -- it's far less important in this case because there's nothing we have to protect. There's nothing so important as our military. But we're also providing massive numbers of jobs because we build all of that equipment in the United States.
That's the one case where the jobs just aren't as important, right? But we're doing good all here. And I'm very proud to report that we have given our servicemembers their largest pay raise in over a decade.
And I've also directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces called the Space Force -- Space, very important.
That's going to be great. Look, so much is happening now in space. I mean, you have great defense. I'm not just talking about Mars and the Moon, I'm talking about tremendous defense capability, offensive capability. It's in space, so we're going to do the Space Force.
We passed the landmark V.A. accountability law that everybody said you couldn't get passed. Forty years they've been trying to do it. Now if a bad government worker abuses a great veteran, we turn to them and we say, "You're fired. Get the hell out of here."
You're fired. We also passed Veterans Choice, so if our veterans can't get care from the V.A. in a timely manner they have the right to go and see immediately a private doctor get taken care of.
They've been working on that one for 45 years, we got it passed. I'm good at getting things passed. My whole life -- oh, and we're going to get the wall passed. Don't worry about that, don't worry about that.
The obstructionist -- the Democrats are obstructionist. The only thing they do well, they're lousy politicians, they have horrible stupid policies. You know, let's get rid of law enforcement, let's get rid of our military, let's not take care of our vets -- all of these things, let's not build a wall. They are haters. They have tremendous hatred, they have tremendous hatred, but they'll do anything they can to -- really to obstruct or resist.
You know, their word is resist -- resist. I used to see that word. I said, "Why are they doing that?" If it's good for the country, why are they resisting? But they want to resist.
I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, and so many things have happened since then. I also recognized the capital of Israel, and five months later we opened the American Embassy into it.
Instead of apologizing for America, we are standing up for America. We are standing up for the heroes who protect our country. And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. Thank you. [Crowd Chants USA] But to continue our incredible success, we must elect more Republicans and we must elect Troy Balderson. We have to elect Troy.
So get your friends, get your neighbors, get your family and get out and vote for Troy on Tuesday. Loyal citizens, great people like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back this country. We are returning power to where it belongs -- to the American people.
From Columbus to the Queen City, Cincinnati, where I worked for long time, I love Swifton Village -- Swifton Village, a good place, the Queen City. From Dublin to Cleveland, and from Toledo to Mansfield, Ohio has always been the home of red-blooded American patriots, strong people, smart people, real workers, people that I love.
This state is the home of the proud and we are -- we're the home of the proud. We're the home of families and farmers, and miners, and manufacturers, and aviators, and astronauts. Ohio is the home of everything -- everything good.
Ohio is where the Wright Brothers invented the airplane and where Annie Oakley got her gun. And Ohio is the state that gives us American legends and American heroes like Thomas Edison, Neil Armstrong and John Glenn.
We stand on the shoulders of generations of American patriots who knew how to work, knew how to fight and knew how to win. You know how to win. Just like them we're going to keep on working, we're going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning. We're going to win so much you're going to get so tired of winning, just so tired.
You see what's happening. No, we'll keep it going for a long time. We will never give up, we will never give in, and we will never back down. We will never ever stop fighting for our families, our freedom or our great American flag, right?
Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together as a nation, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio, thank you.
Thank you very much, and thank you to the original Lee Greenwood. Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Great guy. Well, I just want to say a very big, hello, Kentucky. Great place. It's great to be here in the home of a group called the Wildcats. Did you ever hear about the Kentucky Wildcats? And by the way, they play in a very big arena.
This place -- look at this. Wow. Hello, up there. This is incredible, with thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots, which is what you are. What you are. Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls, and you will vote to re-elect your terrific Republican Governor, Matt Bevin.
He's done a fantastic job. He's done a fantastic job. And we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world. That the Republican Party, you know what we stand for, but you see what's happening with the Democrats. They have gone crazy. [Audience shouts "Boo"] The do-nothing Democrats and they're not getting it done under.
Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring, Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before. True. [Audience chants "USA"] Kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country. That's not bad.
And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives and the job that Matt Bevin has done as Governor. He's had to do some things that you had to do and he's done unbelievably well, and it sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future, you had to do it. So, I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do, but you have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state.
And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the Constitution as written. And we're supporting our police, we're rebuilding our military, we're defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before. The monstrous animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead and the man that took his place is dead also.
[Audience chants "USA"] American Special Forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one-way ticket to hell. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before. We've rebuilt it and it was all made in America, all made in America, and our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again.
But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical Democrats are going totally insane. [Audience shouts "Boo"] They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out fade from the public square, silen -- and you know this -- silence you online, confiscate your guns, you better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious.
They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobody's touching our Second Amendment, and that includes a gentleman that's running against Matt. They're after your Second Amendment. We can't let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this. Destroy anyone who holds traditional American values.
All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic high school, some of whom are here tonight. The far-left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe, and how you should live. [Audience shouts "Boo"] They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes.
They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken. Kentucky can't be broken. You're too strong and you're too smart. In their crazed thirst for power, the Democrats are trying to tear our country apart. First, Democrats engineered the Russia Hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian Hoax.
Then, they did the Mueller scam, you remember that, the Mueller scam. Two years and they said nothing, and then, Mr. Mueller testified. That was a wonderful day, for me. And do you remember last week? I don't know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. I don't know Jill Stein, she's a greenie and that's fine.
She's a greenie, Jill Stein. But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now, corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff. They are corrupt. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great. Nancy oughta stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system.
What's happened to San Francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, it's unbelievable, Los Angeles. You take a look at Los Angeles, it looks like a third-world city, but go back to Nancy's area. Look at what's happened. There's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents, and she's wasting all of her time, and you know what, it's backfiring.
You see it. But the media and the Democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation with a deranged hyper-partisan impeachment with [Inaudible]. Impeach, think of it. [Audience shouts "Boo"] So today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market. Now, that's hundreds of dollars.
[Audience chants "USA"] So last week, think of this, in the history of our country, it's never done better. And by the way, that's not rich, that's not poor, that's for everybody. Your 401(k)s, how are you doing? Pretty good, right? Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they've been running 401(k)s for years, and they totally lost respect for -- let's say the husband, totally lost respect.
Now, they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant, financial mind. And you know what? If the Democrats get in, that's not going down by 50%, that's going down to nothing. It's going to be worthless, it's going to be worthless.
You'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen, mark my words, but hopefully, we don't have to even think about it. And that was going to happen here, when we took over that was going down in the wrong direction, and don't forget, that was zero interest, we're paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money, but that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest.
Last week, the Democrats voted to try and nullify the ballots of tens of millions of Americans to be exact, 63 million people disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won and actually before we won they were plotting to overthrow this election before we won.
19 minutes after I took the oath of office, the disgusting Washington Post -- look at all these people back there, look. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Fake news media, it's the fake news, look at all of them. What they don't know is that when we hang it up in five years or nine years or 13 years or maybe 17 years or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years.
See now, they're going crazy. Now, they're saying see, I told you, he was a dictator. He wants to take charge, in control of our country. These people are crazy. You have -- you have one nut job on television, he's sitting down, doing an interview recently, and he looks at the person he's interviewing, and he goes like he's in total depression, total depression.
And he goes, he -- good friends up there. Thank you. He goes, you know he's going to win, don't you? You know he's going to win. Like he's -- like devastated, the guy goes, well, we're going to fight and we're going to -- no, no, he's going to win. You know he's never leaving office, don't you? He's never going to leave office?
These people are crazy, they're crazy. But that disgusting newspaper that's right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. [Audience shouts "Boo"] All right, you can get them out. Be gentle, be gentle, be very gentle. You know, every time I say get them out of here.
I end up getting sued. He says oh, gee, they hurt my arm. All right, so be very gentle, please. I don't want to get sued. Be very gentle, very, very gentle. He's going home to mom. Thank you. By the way, do we love our law enforcement? And in the whole world, even on a Monday night, you know, I like Monday nights, because I think we're 58 and zero.
That's a good record. Even for the Wildcats, that's a good -- we're 58 and zero, but even on a Monday night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally? Nothing cooler. With last week's vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that I've ever seen and I've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time, and the Democrats have never witnessed anything like it. And they know, they're not going to win in 2020. So, let's see, what can we do to win?
But that's not working too well, you'll see. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. The Democrats' outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the Do-nothing Democrats the hell out of office soon. [Inaudible] Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message.
You will vote to reject the Democrats extremism, socialism, and corruption, and you will vote to re-elect Kentucky Governor, Matt Bevin, who's done a great job. Matt's a veteran, he's a patriot, he's done it all, he's been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible.
Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also, we worked together. Now, he is difficult. I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election. But it's OK. Here, look, he's such a pain when he needs something for Kentucky, like, money, like aid, like he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky.
Could you call the head of some company in Japan, please, I say, Matt, do I have to do it? Please, please, but isn't that really what you want in a Governor? That's what you want. He's such a pain in the ass, but that's what you want. And the job he's done, one of the best in the country, not the best, he's been incredible.
Matt is so strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration. Thank you. He's pro-worker, pro-life, and 100% pro-Second Amendment. And by the way, you're going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in a Democrat. You think I'm kidding, I see what they're saying, I watch what they're doing, they're calling me all the time, you will lose your Second Amendment as soon -- I'm telling you.
As sure as you're standing here. So, anybody sitting -- nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want -- nah, just stand. You know what they say? The fact is, look, you've been standing, nobody sat, I don't know, is it that exciting? Nobody said you know what they say? No, you know what they say? They say, Trump only got one standing ovation because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they don't say the second part.
It's great, great, great spirit. You know why? You love our country, and you see what's happening. We have turned this big monstrous ship, we have turned it around, and we need so badly. You know, it's like you plant a tree. It takes a lot -- we have to get those roots to hold. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country.
So many things, so many things, the best employment numbers. We have the best of everything and I think, I'm going to count, but I think it's like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today. I think about 100 -- I'm going to have to check it, because, you know, with the fake news, if I'm off by a half a point, if it's 117 and not 118, even if I go under they report it. They say, he didn't tell the truth.
It was really 119, but I like a lot over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. Think of that, that's incredible, but Matt Bevin has made-record investments and education spending for Kentucky students. Education is so important to them. Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values. He loves his state.
From an all-out assault being waged on you from the extreme left, not good. I can't even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left? You know this guy, Beshear is a major lefty. You know that, right? Why are we even -- let's just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt?
I don't know. How does Kentucky vote for a person -- I'm telling you. He will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer and shifty Schiff. How about this guy? How about Schiff? He makes up a conversation, he gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new President, a good guy, repeats it. I said I never said that.
He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie, and then, I actually went and released the actual conversation, and you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that. Have you? Because the whistleblower said lots of things that weren't so good, folks. You're going to find out. But these are very dishonest people, shifty Schiff, but Matt's running against these people, and we have to send them aside because they're dangerous.
The radical left's named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything, Kentucky stands for. That's who they want to win. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Beshear, has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump. What are the policies? Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. They're not leaving anymore.
You see, companies aren't leaving anymore. Have you noticed? Remember years ago, before I ever thought of doing this, I mean, when I said let's do this. I said to great, now First Lady, I said, Melania. Let's give it a shot, and then, one by one, we were doing good. And what we've done, if you remember, before we ran, companies were leaving Kentucky, they were leaving, they were going to Mexico.
They were going to China, Japan. They were going all over, any place but Kentucky. You don't read about that at all. Now, they're all coming back. They're all coming back. But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky.
The greatest economy you've ever had, he's going to destroy it, and it won't be long. It'll go very quickly, you know, you're all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs, you don't like it. You go find another job. It's like the choice I got for military. I got you your choice too. If you don't like your job, you find another.
When you tell the boss, hey, I'm getting out of here, I don't like this. You go get a better job for more money. Beshear doesn't represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics.
Open borders, let everyone pour right in. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Let them all pour right in. Beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky. Think of that one, releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families. He wants sanctuary cities, he hasn't learned what's happened.
You know, we had a great election, a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina, we won two House seats. We were supposed to lose, probably both of them, and we won them by a lot. We won them by a lot, and I think, we won them because of the Second Amendment, because it's under assault from democrats, but I think, we won also because of sanctuary cities, because some bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad.
And I think, that was a reason we won both House seats by a lot. Beshear is too liberal, too extreme, and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky. Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican. We got to go Republican all the way. And I want to bring up a man and I'm serious about this. This guy worked so hard.
He's a great natural talent in business, which you needed, and he straightened it out and I'll tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history, and maybe, the greatest in the history of this state, Matt Bevin, Come on up, Matt.
How do you like having President Trump in Rupp Arena? This is better. This is better than the final four, I'll tell you what, in terms of energy, this is extraordinary. Thank you, Kentucky. It is critical that we go top to bottom, run the slate, vote straight Republican, but do your civic duty. Let's get out and vote.
Let's send a message to Washington, to the other states, to the United States of America that Kentucky is leading the way, and that we support the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
So, we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington. Your great Senator, Mitch McConnell. Nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch. I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. It's up here. I know a lot of people that work hard, he works smart.
When the Democrat arsonist in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now, just as Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left-wing mob and that's what it was. It was a mob. There has never been a man treated so badly in Washington, as Judge Kavanaugh. Previously judge, now, Justice.
We got him in and he's been great, and he will be great. Mitch confirmed to tremendous Supreme Court Justices. Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and past VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans. Now, I know Mitch's opponent because I came here -- do you remember last year?
Slightly different location, no, that's OK. It was still the great state of Kentucky because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath, an extreme Liberal against him. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And Andy Barr is here with us tonight and we're going to introduce him, but he'd beat her. So, she said to herself. You know I failed in Congress.
Now, let's go for the Senate, she wanted to go to the House. Now, she wants to go -- it's not going to work that way, extreme Liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things. Amy McGrath compared my election, think of this one, it's so insulting. I shouldn't say, should I say it? Yeah. Why not? No, it's so insulting.
You know, you work so hard. You love your country so much and they get up and say things. She compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation. She wants open borders. She supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody. Yeah, she wants to get rid of me. She wasn't too happy with me last year. We came in Andy and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy, and she was caught telling donors, Democrats that she is further left than anyone in the history of the state of Kentucky.
[Audience shouts "Boo"] It's not what you want. No, so next November, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed Kentucky Conservative, Mitch McConnell, but we're going to get back to that later. We'll be back many times, we'll be back here many times, Mitch.
Well, thank you, Mr. President, for making America great again, and Matt Bevin is making Kentucky great again. Thanks for your help tonight. In working together, we're changing the federal courts forever. Nobody's done more to change the court system in the history of our country than Donald Trump. And Mr. President, we're going to keep on doing it, my motto is: leave no vacancy behind.
So, President Obama left Mitch and me and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings to the judges. You're not supposed to allow any. You don't do that, you know, they say the most important thing a President can do is federal judges, right? Including the Supreme Court, obviously. And I came in and I said, how many do we have?
And they said, how many what, sir? I said judge openings, and I thought they'd say none or one or two. He said, sir, we have 142. I said what? I said tell me again. He said we have 142. So, Mitch and I, and Rand would like to thank very much, President Obama, because nobody has ever been so generous than him.
Also, with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and he's really become a good friend of mine. And I'll tell you, he's a little bit different, it's OK. But whenever I've needed him, whenever I needed him, he was always there. It's true. I mean sometimes, like I'd say, I don't need your vote Rand.
Good. Then, he'll vote his own way. He's got that little Libertarian touch, that's OK, that's OK. But whenever we need -- and I'm not talking about me -- I'm talking about we -- we need a vote. He's so incredible and he's become a really good friend, and I want to have him come up for a second. Rand Paul, your senator, a great warrior.
President Trump has great courage. He faces down the fake media every day, but Congress needs to step up and have equal courage to defend the President. Hunter Biden made $50,000 a month. That's the definition of corruption. We know he got it only because of his family connections. We also now know the name of the whistleblower.
The whistleblower needs to come before Congress, as a material witness, because he worked for Joe Biden. At the same time, Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs. I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name. And I say this to my fellow colleagues in Congress to every Republican in Washington, step up and subpoena Hunter Biden, and subpoena the whistleblower.
And I say to my colleagues if shifty Schiff will not let Hunter Biden come and if you will not bring the whistleblower forward, every Republican in Congress should take a walk and say this is a farce.
Wow, that was excellent. Wow, thank you. Very Thank you very much Rand. Great job. He's a warrior. He's a warrior. I have always said it. Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are a fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but we'll welcome them also, right? But these are also great fighters, great warriors, Hal Rogers, Brett Guthrie.
Thank you, Brett. Thomas Massie. Man, we just spoke about what a great race Andy Barr, James Colber, and from an incredible state that we won 2016, that crooked Hillary said, she's going to win that state, didn't come too close at winning that state. It's a great state and we love the people of North Carolina, Congressman Mark Meadows, along with some of your local, great politicians, and a person that's done a really spectacular job -- you know in Michigan, a woman she just kept going.
She just kept going, reminded me by the way, of your Governor from the standpoint, she never quit. Now, Republicans hadn't won Michigan in many, many years. She'd call, could you come again? Could you do it again? Could you come make another speech, please? I said all right, this will be the last one. No, no, no, how about a couple of more.
And then, Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton, you better get going. Something is going on in Michigan. You're going to lose Michigan, you better stop going. No, no, no, the polls say everything's good, and we won the great state of Michigan for the first time in many years. And I said when it came time to pick in the Republican Party Chair, Head of the RNC, I said I got to get the woman from Michigan, Ronna McDaniel to head it all.
And when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clinton's campaign was, you know, we're not sophisticated, right? I don't think still. Remember we were all doing to get -- well, she's got the finest computer technology in the world. Yeah, she paid for it, but she didn't get it. She has really fantastic geniuses, but I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had, and his name was Brad Parscale, and he's here with us. Campaign -- what a great job and our numbers are looking very good.
But think of it. We're one day short of a year now, can you believe it? Less than a year it begins, November 3rd, this time. We had that great, great date, oh, boy November 8th, remember? Was there ever a day like that in television history? And they have no idea because when we do hang it up, they're all out of business, they know that.
That's why I think that we will get -- I expect to get a full hearty unbelievable endorsement very soon from the fairly New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post. You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this. I said I'm going to become a politician.
I can't believe it. I'm going to become a politician, but I looked at the New York Times and it was like a little leaflet that you handed out at a grocery store, right? The wind would blow it away. It was dead. I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail, but we built it up. They do stories -- in my entire life I had a few stories on the front page of The New York Times, and now, of -- I have three or four a day, it's like, why are they not covering me anymore?
And they're all bad. They only -- they can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world and they make it look as bad as possible. In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit. They didn't give me any credit nut that's OK. The dog got the credit and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House.
But they'll be endorsing us, and you know, all of these crazy, like CNN, with its bad ratings. There goes, its red light just went off, the red light just went off, CNN. Well, it's hard, look, put yourself in their position. They have it on, their covering, and now, they know they're ready to get hit. So then, they turn it off.
I mean, I can't blame -- no, the red light just went off. No, but put yourself in CNN's position, without us, you know, cable was not supposed to be a good business. Then we came along. It's not me, it's we. They came from the valleys. They came from everywhere. The cities, they came from places, they're still trying to figure out where the hell that all those people come from?
It's true. A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great Congressman friends from Pennsylvania, and he said you know, in Tennessee, we have very early voting, and I just left and I've been doing this for 24 years -- and I've got to be honest with you.
I've never seen so many people vote and these are people. They love our country, they're incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for. So, they really wouldn't vote. It sounds terrible, but they didn't like anything that they saw. They say, sir, I'm seeing people -- and he said this, come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that they've never come out.
We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting, booth, and parlor, and he said, I can't speak for the rest of the country, but if the rest of the country's like Tennessee, you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation, and that's what happened. That was a great statement.
That was a great statement from people from a great state also. Tomorrow, you must elect the entire Republican ticket from Governor on down, including your next Lieutenant Governor, Ralph Alvarado, Ralph Alvarado, he's a good man. And your next Attorney General, Daniel Cameron. Should I bring Daniel up? Get up here, Daniel.
He is a star. He is a star.
Mr. President, I hope you can tell that Kentucky is Trump country. We are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues in here in the Commonwealth. We are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves, and Mr. President, we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians, and Mr. President, I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General.
We are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state. Thank you.
Good. Thank you, Daniel. A star, a star is born. A star is born. Do you ever see that movie? A star is born. Thank you, Daniel. Your next Secretary of State, Michael Adams. Auditor, Mike Harmon. Thank you, Mike. Treasurer, Allison Ball, she's doing great, and Agriculture Commissioner, Ryan Quarles. With the help of everyone here, America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world by far.
Foreign leaders come in to see me, congratulations on your economy, China's doing poorly, as you know, but they're paying us billions and billions and billions of dollars and they've never given us 10 cents before, billions of dollars. They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer.
They're back buying from our farmers. But we've created 6.7 million new jobs since the election, and if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it. Think of that 6.7 million, and today, just today, a record 158 million Americans are now employed.
The highest level of employment in our country's history. African-American unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment rates have also reached the all-time historic lows, in the history of our country. Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9% since the election.
Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said how the hell can you lose 60,000? It turned out to be right, and you know how I know? Because I've been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me, two years.
I get a call sometimes from the people on the campaign, sir, sir, we have an emergency. What's the emergency, somebody is calling from the media, fake news. Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir? Because they consider it to be a front-page story. OK. Under my administration, we've added nearly 10,000 new factories, and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our country.
We'll reverse it. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts, massive. To lift up distressed communities, our tax laws created opportunity zones. Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great Governor, by the way, the other Governor, I don't think, well, I don't know.
They're not going to do so well. He'll be calling for a meeting, and I won't be able to see him because I don't like him very much, but I like this one very much and we're going to help. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. We ended the war on American energy, we're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world by far.
And we ended the war on beautiful, clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris climate accord. Ask them how they're doing in Paris with it? Not too good. I canceled the so-called Clean Power Plan and repealed Obama's federal coal moratorium. We're putting our great miners back to work.
On trade, we're starting to set records every week, we're reversing decades of Washington, disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing, as China looted our factories and stole up to $500 billion of American dollars -- By the way, people can't even believe it, not five hundred million.
That's a lot if you lost five hundred million, that's a lot. I thought that was another typo, $500 billion, they would take a year from us. We rebuilt China, and I give them a lot of credit by the way, I give China. What I don't give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama. I don't give them credit because they let it happen.
They should have never let it happen, but now, we're taking in tens of billions and billions and billions of dollars. Just recently, very slow, sleepy Joe Biden that is, said if China's piracy and plunder -- they're not that bad, folks. He always use the word, folks. I watched him today, he used the word, folks.
Hi, folks. Hi, my time is up. I've got to leave. Now, they have him more freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So, I could just see these handlers because the handlers, like they use on horses, the handlers, right? All right. Get him off there, he's been up there long enough. So, they're screaming to get off, get off, sleepy Joe get off the stage.
Please, please, Joe, you're doing fine, Joe you're doing fine, you're doing fine. And then, he goes hello [Inaudible] in Ohio, but he was in Iowa yesterday, and they say damn it he should have left sooner. We told them get off the stage sleepy Joe, sleepy Joe get off the damn stage, but he said about, sleepy Joe, about China, they're not that bad folks.
They're not really competition for us, no they're not. Five hundred billion a year, right? He did nothing in eight years him and Obama, in fact, I'm here because of them when you think about it right? I'm here because of them, Kellyanne Conway, stand up Kellyanne, another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne -- no, but think of it, as somebody was saying, well, look, the $1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience who doesn't know anything, they got a lot of money from Ukraine, but got $1.5 billion from China.
I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China, they're very tough. That is not the same group of Chinese people that I've been negotiating with. They gave him $1.5 billion. He'll make millions and millions with that and how about saying, by the way, Mr. President, would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling, guess what?
You would be sold down the tubes so fast and we're so close. China wants to make a deal so badly. I think they'd love to see another President. I think -- would they like, they would like to see another President more than crooked Hillary would, OK? Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which got to be one of the greatest deals ever made?
It has to be because we started down here and they were up there. It has to be. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations? This is what China would love more than anything else. It's not going to happen, folks, because we can't let our country go back to hell. We can't do it. We can't let it happen.
Because the Bidens got rich while America was robbed, and let me tell you, the fake news will not put it in. I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper, saying, well, it's totally unsubstantiated. Mr. Biden, it's totally -- what's unsubstantiated? He is on tape, doing a real quid pro quo.
Sir, it's totally unsubstantiated, sir. I've never seen anything like it. Could you imagine if I did what he did? Could you imagine if Don Junior or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was, let's say, Vice President or President? Let's say they walked out of China with $1.5 billion. Do you think the press would be saying?
Well, it's unsubstantiated. No, it's something. Let me just tell you something. These people, not all of them, but these people are very dishonest people, OK? [Audience shouts "Boo"] Very, very dishonest people. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America is not for sale, and we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and that's what we're doing with these crazy people.
A lot of bad things happened and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have -- with a normal person wouldn't have away with, let's face it. These are bad people. Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over $100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us, and I'll tell you they started buying our farm product.
You see that. They started buying a lot of our products even before the deals are done. Last year, I got our farmers $16 billion because they were targeted, and the year before, I got them $12 billion. I just took them out of the tariff, so we had a lot leftover, and I said, congratulations, farmers. I love you.
I love our farmers, they love me, that's why they did -- they targeted our farms. I said, congratulations, that's compliments of China, and they do. They want to make a deal so badly. Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal. That's the way it is because we're doing very well right now with China.
We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement, a huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky autoworkers, for Kentucky manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do-nothing Democrats, don't want to give the people of our country a victory. It's really -- let it be a bipartisan deal.
I don't care. It's such an incredible deal for this country, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. Democrats need to pass the USMCA, we need their votes, otherwise, you can't pass it, and it's up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but she's too busy wasting their time. So, either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess.
The Obama-Biden's administration's Trans-Pacific Partnership would have dealt a death blow to the American auto industry. That would have been one of the great catastrophes. My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty, you know all about it. Under our policies just days ago, Ford and the UAW announced a $1 billion investment in Louisville.
$1 billion. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects. They were globalists. I was elected to be President of the United States, not President of the globe. They decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries.
Tell me, how is that good? They try and convince you it's good. I was a very good student and very like -- we're all smart. We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are -- something wrong with them. They -- [Inaudible] only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise. You're right, you are right about it. They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare estates with your money, the money we spend on other country's militaries, but it's coming down, and I'm telling other countries, I'm sorry you're going to have to pay now.
I'm sorry, pay, pay, you've got to pay. And they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair. We go in for the Internet, we want rural, we'll bring it in, and we're bringing 5G into places like Kentucky that haven't been properly served.
We're bringing it in all over the Middle West, all over the country, and we're really ahead of schedule. We're doing really well. People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but we're doing very well, but you were very much underserved for years, and yet, we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of. It doesn't make sense, does it? But after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation.
We are finally putting America first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No, thank you. No, thank you. That's why we ended the Paris accord.
That's why we've -- we've ended a lot. I don't even want to tell you, but the sell-out of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office, and you understand that. Past leaders transform faraway nations into chaotic war zones. Then, they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted regions.
Take the people, take the people, we defeated ISIS. We, when I took over three years ago, when we took over when I took over, ISIS was all over. I defeated ISIS. You know, I didn't even know to what extent. I was watching the other night, the great Lou Dobbs, and he said when Trump took over, President Trump.
He used to say, Trump is a great President. Then he said, Trump is the greatest President since Ronald Reagan, then he said. Then he said, no, no, Trump is an even better President than Ronald Reagan. And now, he's got me down as the greatest President in the history of our country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
[Inaudible] Thank you. We love you too, but we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here. We didn't do that. We're not doing that. You see what we're going and you see what we're doing, and you see it's never easy because I get hit by this swamp 15 different ways, but it doesn't matter. We're doing the right thing to protect our communities.
My administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries. A lot of people were against it. They said, isn't that terrible. Countries that have crime rates that are so high, you wouldn't even believe it's possible, and we have a travel ban now. We don't take people from those countries, I'm sorry.
And we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court, ruled it totally constitutional. Or no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration. Democrats want open borders. They want to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have, and more benefits than our own military gets.
[Audience shouts "Boo"] In the Republican Party, we believe in taking care of our own citizens first is paramount. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May, the wall is being built, it's going up rapidly. It's got a big impact and I want to thank Mexico.
We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border, policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end loopholes. That would take us 15 minutes so we could end the loopholes. Think of the word loopholes. They don't want to end the loophole. If you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities, you have only one choice tomorrow, and that's to vote for Matt Bevin.
Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day. The Democrats plan government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare. What are they doing? I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors. It's going to be protected. What they're doing is crazy and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, and we will also protect you with preexisting physicians.
How about that? Preexisting physicians, first time I've ever said that just thought of that. It's true. Because under their plan, you don't get your own doctor, you know what you get? Whatever the hell you get. That's what you get. Oh, great, doc. Fix me up, doc. You mean you want to work on my heart? Who are you, Doc?
I don't think so. Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic, with your Governor's help, we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky, which is a record. Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith. Anybody in here a person of faith? [Audience shouts "Yeah"] Great people, the last administration, threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs.
Last week, my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault. It was an assault. And Governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there's no better leader than him, what he has done. And together, we're fighting for American orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers, and he's done a fantastic job.
Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and it's the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. We forgot that, right? Abraham Lincoln.
The incredible rebuilding of our military includes over $100 billion investments all across the state of Kentucky. I withdrew our nation from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal, it's not the same country. When I came in, that country, there were in 18 different sites of [Inaudible] they called it, and now, they're a little different, a little different.
We'll see what happens with Iran. And I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. Remember? He'd go around, oh thank you so much. He wouldn't apologize to you, but he apologized to others. Now, you have a President who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky.
The next step to victory begins tomorrow, and it begins with all of you. You have to do this. Look, maybe you'll be late for work. Maybe you'll be late for whatever. I don't want to know everything. There are some things I don't want to know, but you have to just put it off. You have to go vote. It's so important.
Tomorrow is so -- because you know, beyond even the Governorship, and it's so important because you say, again, your state is setting records. In the history of your state, you've never done this well, economically, job-wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants.
You've never done this well, but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country. It's so important. You got to get your friends. You've got to vote because if you lose, it sends a really bad message, just sends a bad -- and they will build it up. Here's the story, if you win they're, going to make it like ho-hum, and if you lose, they're going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world.
This was the greatest. You can't let that happen to me, and you know what, you can't let that happen to your incredible state, Kentucky. You can't let that happen. That would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible Governor, but you're going to have a great victory tomorrow. With your support, you have to go out.
We will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down. So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get out and vote for Governor Matt Bevin, and all of these great Republicans. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity.
Together, we will elect a Republican Congress. In 2020 we're going re-elect because of their stupidity. These people are on the run and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raised their hand. And don't forget that out of 194 we got 194, not one Republican left us last week, and two Republicans, think of that, and the other three couldn't get there because of -- but they were votes.
They said they would totally go vote and said had airport problems. I said you can't do that, airport problems, but then, we had the Democrats. We picked up two Democrats. So we had bipartisan support. That's unusual. I always say because they're lousy politicians, they've got lousy policy, but they do stick together.
That's about it. We will elect a Republican Congress in 2020. And we'll have a great speaker of the House and Kevin. We're going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words, made in the USA.
We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years, we've already started. Who would have thought we could have done that? We've started. And the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done.
They didn't do anything, they didn't do anything, but we did. We have it all funded and we started -- think of that. Aids, within ten years, will be out of this country. Nobody would have thought that was possible. We will end it. Great. Great. They came into my office. They were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made.
It's incredible what they're doing, and don't forget, right to try, by the way, where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past. So, instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world or going home, hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try.
We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world. They can now go and try, and we are having unbelievable success, unbelievable, right to try. We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday soon, we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars.
You know, I said we've done the moon, no, they say, sir, we landed on the moon to go to Mars, and that's what we're doing with the moon, and we are really, really advanced. It's moving along rapidly. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms, and above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one America.
We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement, we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag.
Loyal citizens, like you, helped build this country, and together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. The great state of Kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth. These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home.
They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common: they love their families, they love their country, and they love their god. These proud Kentucky Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage.
Our allegiance is to our nation. Our loyalty is to our citizens, and our devotion is to our creator. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, we are one people, we are one family, and one glorious nation under God.
America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will Make America Great Again. Thank you, Kentucky. Thank you. Go out and vote.
Thank you. Thank you, everybody. [Applause] I am thrilled to be here in the great state of Kentucky and the beautiful city of Louisville! [Applause] And this place is packed! [Applause] There are a lot of people outside aren't getting in, but that's all right. We love them, too, right? We love them, too. [Applause]
We're in the heartland of America and there is no place I would rather be than here with you tonight. [Applause] Our first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, was born right here in Kentucky. [Applause] That's not bad. The legendary pioneer Daniel Boone helped settle the Kentucky frontier. [Applause]
And the great 19th century American statesman Henry Clay represented Kentucky in the United States Congress. [Applause] Henry Clay believed in what he called the American system and proposed tariffs to protect American industry and finance American infrastructure. [Applause]
I'm honored to be here today with many of your tremendous, modern-day leaders. [Applause] We're joined tonight -- and I want you to give him a nice hand because he's on our side, got to take good care of our people, right... [Applause] ...and he's got a lot of power for the people of Kentucky -- by our Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Where is he? Come here, Mitch. [Applause] Thank you, Mitch. How are you doing, Mitch? Hey, Mitch, are we going to be OK? Everything good? That health care is looking good? Good, thanks, Mitch. [Applause]
And we're also very lucky to have in my Cabinet our secretary of transportation, the wonderful Elaine Chao. [Applause] Working with Secretary Chao, we're going to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure of the United States. [Applause] It's time, right? It's time. [Applause]
It is time. After spending trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, it is indeed time. We are going to start taking care of our country. [Applause] Also with us this evening is your great governor, Matt Bevin. Where's Matt? [Applause] Matt! Thanks, Matt.
Congressman Andy Barr and Congressman Jamie Comer. [Applause] The state motto of Kentucky is "united we stand, divided we fall." We are united. [Applause] Somebody from the fake media the other day asked me a question. [Booing]
They said, how are the Republicans going to finally get together? I said, wait a minute, we won the presidency, we won the House, we won the Senate. I mean, right? [Applause] Actually, he was a nice guy that asked the question, but I was sort of thinking that was an interesting question because we've just about never been on a streak like this. I think 1928, that's a long time ago, and we're going to get a lot of things done.
And then we're going to get to truly one of my favorite things. It's called reducing taxes. [Applause] Standing together as Americans we are going to deliver amazing things for the citizens of Kentucky and the United States. Most importantly, we are going to take power back from the political class in Washington and return that power to you the American people. It's happening. It's happening. It's happening. [Applause]
It started on November 8th. Remember that beautiful, beautiful day? That beautiful day, we're going to give it back. [Applause] That was a beautiful day. They weren't giving us a lot of chance, were they? Remember? There is no path to 270, right? [Applause]
Remember the line? And, you know, for the Republicans, the Electoral College was very, very hard, very hard to win. Do you remember the famous line, there is no path to 270? Well, there was a path to 306, but maybe not to 270. [Applause]
But we have a lot of work to do. The fact is we inherited a mess. It's a mess. I met with the prime minister today of Iraq. I met with others, the Middle East, North Korea. [Booing] North Korea, I'll tell you what, what's happening there is disgraceful and not smart, not smart at all. So many different problems.
And I'll tell you, you see what's happening with the economy. We've picked up $3 trillion in value and our companies are bringing people back to work. [Applause]We have to take on every special interest that has profited from this. And, I mean, I don't mean, like, a little bit, I mean really terrible trade deals, horrible trade deals. Last year, our country lost almost $800 billion in trade. Not going to happen anymore, folks. It's not going to happen anymore. [Applause]
Uncontrolled immigration, you see what's going on there. That's happening quickly. Got a little problem with the courts not wanting to give us the decisions that should be given. But we're going to win it.
And the financial system stacked against the American people. These entrenched interests will do anything they can to keep the broken system in place. But they will fail and we will win because we are fighting on this side of our great American heritage. [Applause]
This place is packed! [Applause]I mean, I don't want to say this, we could have been watching a good basketball game tonight. But what happened? What happened? That's all right. You've done a good job, right? You've done a good job. Great team, great coach. It's all right.
We are going to drain the swamp of government corruption in Washington, D.C. and we are going to keep our promises, all of the promises that we made. [Applause] We are going to massively reduce your taxes. [Applause]We are going to reduce very substantially rising crime and support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause]
We're going to bring accountability to the V.A. and take great care finally, finally, finally of our great veterans. [Applause] And our secretary, you wouldn't believe it, because I still don't have my Cabinet, they won't approve my Cabinet. [Booing]
There is a lot of division and a lot of bad stuff going on in this country. But I'll tell you -- David, we love David, David got approved 100-to-nothing, can you believe it? Head of the V.A., secretary of the V.A. [Applause]
And you watch what happens with the veterans. It's time. It's time we take care of our veterans. [Applause] We are going to rebuild the United States military finally. [Applause] I have proposed a budget that calls for one of the largest increases in defense spending history. And we need it. We need it. Got a lot of bad actors out there, folks, right? [Applause]
That's time also. And it's also jobs because we're going to make this equipment right here in the USA. [Applause] And we believe in three crucial words: Peace through strength. [Applause]
There's our great lieutenant governor, by the way, please. [Applause] Thank you, darling. Thank you. But we will spend our money wisely. With just one negotiation on one set of airplanes, I saved the taxpayers of our country over $700 million. [Applause]
And that's just one of many. One of many. We've also kept our promise to appoint a Supreme Court justice who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [Applause]
Judge Neil Gorsuch's hearing is now under way in the Senate. And I urge members of both parties to swiftly approve his nomination. He is an outstanding man from an outstanding family with an unbelievably wonderful wife. They should approve.
There's another promise that is deeply important to me and I know it is deeply important to you. We are going to put our coal miners back to work. [Applause] They have not been treated well, but they're going to be treated well now. Clean coal, right? Clean coal. I have already eliminated a devastating anti-coal regulation and that is just the beginning. You saw that.
We got a lot of thank yous from a lot of great people that worked very hard and want to keep working. A lot of people are going to be put back to work, a lot of coal miners are going back to work.
As we speak, we are preparing new executive actions to save our coal industry and to save our wonderful coal miners from continuing to be put out of work. The miners are coming back. [Applause]
Our new EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, a Kentucky native, will turn the EPA -- environmental -- will turn the EPA from a job killer into a job creator. You watch. [Applause] Since my Inauguration, we've already added nearly a half-a- million new jobs. And that's, believe me, just the beginning, just the beginning. [Applause]
And I don't know, did you see those consumer confidence levels? Matt, they're through the roof. I don't even know. I think you're doing as well in Kentucky, but I know you don't like Obamacare. I know. [Booing]
Great guy. We're working to remove regulations on our auto industry so we can make more cars right here in America, including more cars in Kentucky. [Applause] We've wiped out many, many unnecessary regulations and that's just the beginning. It's continuing on a weekly basis.
We're getting rid of unnecessary regulations. We're going to be good for business and we're going to be good for the workers of America. [Applause] We've also cleared the way for the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipelines. [Applause]
And as I was signing it, I said, where are they getting the steel? Where? And I said, you know what, if people want to build pipelines in the United States, they should use American steel and they should build it and create it right here. That pipe is going to be manufactured right here. [Applause]
That was, like, the last minute. I'm saying, where are they buying this stuff? Like Henry Clay, we want to put our own people to work. We believe in two simple rules: buy American and hire American. [Applause]
So as you folks all know, Henry Clay was a legendary Kentucky politician who became the eighth speaker of the House in 1811. You know, they compared my campaign to Jackson, President Jackson, right, of 1828. I said, can you imagine having to go back that far? And they said this was even more severe.
But we did a good job. Did we do a great job together? [Applause]1828, that's a long time ago. Oh, boy. And he was a good president, right? He was a good president. Clay was a fierce advocate for American manufacturing. He wanted it badly. He said very strongly free trade, which would throw wide open our ports to foreign production, without duties while theirs remain closed to us. That was his quote.
He knew all the way back, early 1800s. Clay said that trade must be fair, equal and reciprocal. Boom, he said fair, equal and reciprocal. I'm talking about reciprocal trade -- reciprocal. [Applause]
I mentioned that the other day to a group in my office. We're going to be doing some trade deals as soon as we get the health care finished. Oh, I'm looking forward to these trade deals. They're the ones. Oh, there's going to be no ambiguity. But I use the word "reciprocal."
You know, Harley-Davidson makes great motorcycles. They were in my office. They were in my office. And they came in. I said, how are you doing? Great. How's business? Great. How do you do overseas? Well, it's tough. We have some countries that charge us a $100 import tax. I said a hundred -- a 100 percent. Think of it. They want a hundred dollars on that -- 100 percent. So I said, how do you do? Not so well, it's tough. They have other countries that charge a lot.
We want reciprocal. So if they're going to charge us a hundred percent, we're going to charge them a hundred percent. And you know what's going to happen? They're going to bring their hundred percent down to nothing like we charge. We can't allow that to happen. We can't allow that to happen. [Applause]
In explaining his American system, Clay argued that the sole object of the tariff is to tax the produce. And remember, to tax the produce of foreign industry with the view of promoting American industry. For too long, our government has abandoned the American system. Since NAFTA was approved in 1994, the worst trade deal ever made by any country, I think, in the world, America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs. Do not worry, we are starting on NAFTA very soon.
You know, I've only been there for, what, 52 days, right? [Applause] Somebody said to me, when are you starting on NAFTA? I said, wait a minute, I did this, this, this, I've knocked out unbelievable numbers of regulations, we're negotiating much better deals, these terrible deals that were made. I've been here, like, 51 days. Give me a chance. [Laughter]
Oh, I look forward. We're going to do something with NAFTA that you are going to be very, very impressed with. That's going to be an easy one, folks. That's going to be an easy one.
Since China joined, that's another beauty, the World Trade Organization in 2001, the United States has lost many more than 60,000 factories. We sacrificed our own middle class to finance the growth of foreign countries. But those days, ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, are over. Is that OK? [Applause]
Those days are over. It's crazy. You know what that is? Much more than 60,000 factories. You know what that is? It's, like, I said, if you have a map, how do you put that many dots on the map, right? More than 60,000 factories, but they're all coming back. You see them coming back. You see car companies that were going to build elsewhere and now they're saying that because of Trump we're going to build in Michigan, we're going to build in Ohio, we're going to build in Kentucky. [Applause]
They're saying it loud and clear. Because from now on it's going to be America first, America first. [Applause] We will be, I promise you, a rich nation once again. [Applause] And we will do what we have to do. And we will not allow other countries to take advantage of us like they've been doing to a level that's hard to believe. Hard to believe. Not going to happen.
Not going to happen anymore, Kentucky. Remember that, OK? [Applause] You just worry about your basketball team, I'll take care of the rest. [Applause] But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. That is why I am following through on my promise to secure, protect and defend the borders of the United States. [Applause]
We will build, that's right, a great, great border wall. [Applause] And, you know, it's already out to bid. You've probably been reading, tremendous numbers of bidders. What does that mean when you have a lot of bidders? It means we're going to get it for the right price, OK? Believe me. [Applause]
And we will stop the drugs that are pouring into our country and poisoning our youth and plenty of others. We're going to stop the drugs. [Applause] A lot of them are coming in from the Southern border. Since the day of my election, we've already cut illegal immigration at the Southern border by 61 percent. Think of that. [Applause]
Sixty-one percent and we haven't started. And the courts are not making it easy, folks. They're not making it easy. [Booing] Terrible. Sixty-one percent. During the campaign as I've traveled all across this great country, I met with many American families whose loved ones, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, were viciously killed by illegal immigrants. Incredible. Incredible. These amazing American lives were stolen because our government refused to enforce our already-existing laws. [Booing]
These American victims and their families were ignored by the media. The media doesn't want to talk about it. [Booing]They don't want to talk about it. They were ignored by the consultants. They were ignored by Washington. But these Americans were not ignored by me. They were not ignored by you. You showed that on November 8th. They were not ignored by you and they will never be ignored by any of us. [Applause]
As we speak tonight, we are finding the drug dealers, robbers, thieves, gang members, predators, killers and criminals of all types preying on our citizens. You've been saying it, you've been reading about it and you've been seeing it. One by one they are being tracked down and thrown the hell out of our country and we will not let them back in. [Applause, Chanting] We are also working to protect our citizens from terrorism. [Applause]
We have seen the devastation at home from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino and many, many other places. We've seen attacks overseas in France, in Germany, in Belgium. It's time for intelligence and common sense to be used. [Applause]
The single-best way to protect, and you have to do this, you have to do this, and to keep foreign terrorists from attacking our country is to keep these foreign terrorists from entering our country in the first place. [Applause]
And we will stop radical Islamic terrorism. We will stop it. Not going to let it happen, not here. Not going to let it happen. [Applause]Finally, we want a very big tax cut, but cannot do that until we keep our promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. And we're going to be working very closely with our leader, Mitch McConnell, to get that job done. Paul Ryan, everybody, they're going to be working very hard. And Congressman Andy Barr and Jamie Comer, I have to thank them for their help and their support as we move toward the crucial House vote on Thursday, the seventh anniversary of Obamacare's very painful passage.
This is our long- awaited chance to finally get rid of Obamacare. [Applause] It's a long-awaited chance. We're going to do it. We're going to do it. What's the alternative? The alternative is what you have. What you have is nothing, the worst, it's the big lie. And remember this, so true, I happen to like a lot Senator Rand Paul, I do. [Applause]
I do, I like him. He's good. He's a good guy. And I look forward to working with him so we can get this bill passed in some form so that we can pass massive tax reform which we can't do until this happens. So we've got to get this done before we can do the other. In other words, we have to know what this is before we can do the big tax cuts. We've got to get it done for a lot of reasons, but that's one of them. [Applause]
And it's important to realize how we got to Obamacare in the first place. Back in 2009 and 2010, House and Senate Democrats forced through a 2,700-page health care bill that no one read and no one understood. By the way, today it's thousands of pages more, it's not even understandable. They ignored the public, they ignored the voters and they jammed a massive, failed health care takeover right through Congress. [Booing]
And this is what we have. It's time for Democrat leaders in Washington to take responsibility for the disaster they and they alone created. [Applause] Remember when President Obama said if you like your plan you can keep your plan, if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor? [Booing]
Nobody brings that stuff up, do they? Do they ever bring it up? Matt, I don't think so, right? They don't bring it up. Notice how they forget all those things?
Or when the architect of Obamacare said the law was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. Or Bill Clinton on the campaign trail -- oh, he must have had a tough night when he went home that night... [Laughter]
... called Obamacare the craziest thing in the world where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. Bill Clinton said that, the craziest thing in the world. Or the Democratic governor of Minnesota who said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.
It's been one broken promise after another. People have been kicked off their plans and their premiums have increased by double and triple digits. Arizona up 116 percent. By the way, insurance companies in a great state known as Kentucky -- have you ever heard of it -- are in tremendous trouble, will be fleeing and we're going to save it all. We're going to save it all. Tremendous trouble, it's a disaster. [Applause]
In fact, to counter my speech two weeks in Congress -- I don't know, did anybody see that speech -- they used the former governor of Kentucky. [Booing] And the plan doesn't work in Kentucky. But Matt will save us.
Many of our best and brightest are leaving the medical profession entirely because of Obamacare. Obamacare has been a complete and total catastrophe and it's getting worse and worse by the day. And yet, you watch the fake media, the fake news and they try and build it up. It's a disaster, fellas. It's a disaster. [Booing]
What would be great if they told the truth about Obamacare. It would be so wonderful for the people of this country because it would just sail right through. Our plan would sail right through.
One-third of the counties in the United States now have only one Obamacare insurer left, some have none. And in your state it's worse. In a recent interview, your governor, Matt Bevin, who's right here so I better be careful, said that Obamacare was a disaster in Kentucky.
Is that right? I'm quoting that so accurately. And it is. It's been an absolute disaster. Half of our counties only have a single provider right now. It's a financial disaster waiting to happen right here in your own state. Thursday is our chance to end Obamacare and the Obamacare catastrophe and begin delivering the reforms our people deserve. [Applause]
Big thing. Then we get to tax cuts. Big thing. And remember, we're going to negotiate and it's going to go to the Senate and back and forth. The end result is going to be wonderful and it's going to work great.
Once this is done, we are also going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process. [Applause]
Some people think that's just as important as health care. The cost of medicine in this country is outrageous, many times higher than in some countries in Europe and elsewhere. Why? Same pill, same manufacturer, identical, and it's many times higher in the United States. You know why? Campaign contributions, who knows?
But somebody is getting very rich. We're going to bring it down and we're going to have a great, competitive bidding process. Medicine prices will be coming way down, way, way, way down. And that's going to happen fast. [Applause]
And we're just adding that to the bill. I said we've got to add that to the bill. We were going to do a bill later, we're trying to add it to this bill. And if we can't, we're going to have it right after.
We have some crazy arcane laws, folks, just in case you haven't heard. I am confident that if we empower the American people we will accomplish incredible things for our country, not just on health care, but all across our government.
And by the way, that Second Amendment is very, very safe right now. [Applause] I promised. I said we're going to save the Second Amendment. I promise you we are going to save the Second Amendment. It's very, very safe. It would not be in good shape if a certain other person won this election, I can tell you. You'd not be happy. [Booing]
And if they came to make a speech, 250 people would have shown up. A new spirit of optimism is sweeping across our land and a new national pride is swelling our hearts and stirring our souls. So true. [Applause]
Just imagine what we could accomplish if we stand together as a united American people. [Applause] Our economy will be unleashed and millions will be lifted from welfare to work. Got to work on work. They're going to love it. They're going to love it. From welfare to work.
Our children will grow up in safe communities and they will be educated in schools that teach them to love our country and its values. [Applause] Our inner cities will find a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity. [Applause]
And, you know, your San Francisco quarterback, I'm sure nobody ever heard of him. [Booing] I'm just reporting the news. There was an article today -- I love to report the news and then they said I made a mistake, right? I said, no, the people reporting the news made a mistake if it's wrong. But there was an article today, it was reported that NFL owners don't want to pick him up because they don't want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump.
Do you believe that? [Applause] I just saw that. I just saw that. I said, if I remember that one, I'm going to report it to the people of Kentucky because they like it when people actually stand for the American flag. Right? [Applause]
Our struggling industries are going to be revitalized and our dying factories will come roaring back to life. It's already happening. [Applause] And in our dealing with other nations, we will find a new era of security, cooperation and peace. And we won't be played for the fool and we won't be played for the suckers any longer. [Applause]
This is the future that awaits us if we embrace our destiny as Americans, which we did. This was one of the greatest things, one of the biggest events ever to happen in our country. And we're going to make it even better than anybody ever thought possible. That's happening already. [Applause]
We are one people and we share one faith. Whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood. [Applause] We all salute the same great American flag. [Applause] And we are all made by the same almighty God. [Applause]
As long as we remember these truths, we will not fail. Nobody, nobody can beat us, nobody! [Applause] We are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to you. This is your moment, this is your time and this, the United States of America, is your country again. [Applause]
So with hope in our souls and patriotism in our hearts, let us now recite these words. Are you ready? Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again! Thank you. Thank you, Kentucky. God bless you. Thank you. [Applause]
Wow. Wow. Wow. [Audience chanting Trump, USA] Thank you very much, Georgia. This is like being at a Georgia football game. This is incredible. Wow. Man. I only wish the media was back about 200 yards so that all those people behind them could see. And we have 15,000 people in a different location. I think Brian's going to do very well.
Going to do very well. I'm thrilled to be back in this great state that, by the way, we won very easily in 2016. With thousands of hard-working and wonderful American patriots. And that's what you are. In just two days, the people of Georgia are going to elect Brian Kemp... as your next governor to protect your jobs, defend your borders, fight for your values and continue to make America great again.
This is one of the most important elections of our lifetime. This is a very important election. I wouldn't say it's as important as 2016, but it's right up there. It's right up there. It really is. It's become so incredible and there is electricity in the air like I haven't seen since the 2016 big victory that we all had together.
Incredible electricity. And in fact, speaking of that, could I ask -- look at this. It's like the Academy Awards. Look at how many cameras. Could I ask you to turn around and shoot? They don't have to do this with other celebrities when they come here that don't have very big crowds. Look at the people back there.
Shoot it. You've got to shoot it. Turn around. Turn around. Turn the cameras around. They never turn them around, folks. They never turn them around. They never turn them around. This crowd goes way, way, way back into the field. This is incredible. This is incredible and I really wish the fake news media would show the crowds because they don't do it. They always go, Donald Trump gave a speech today in front of a nice crowd.
There have never been crowds like this, just so you understand, in the history of politics. You've never had crowds like this for midterm elections. There's never been crowds like this. But you know, all the people, a lot of them watching on television, they get great ratings, at least this speech does. I can't say about the other ones because they don't get great ratings, but you know what?
They get it because they hear the noise. You can't duplicate when you have 20,000, 25,000, 30,000 people, you can't duplicate that sound with 500 people like that are showing up to other rallies. You know, for two years, we had -- we've had big crowds from the beginning, right? And by the way, you remember, we never left and it's we not me. It's we. We're apart.
We're all the same. We. We never left center stage. You know what that means, right? We were always in first place and then we went against crooked Hillary and we did very well there also But we never left center stage. [Audience chants Lock her up] What a group. What a group. You're great people. You're great people.
I want to tell you, you built this country, folks. You built this country. You're great people. But we never did. We never left center stage. Every debate, I was right in the middle. That meant you always had the highest number. You always had the highest number. You were always at -- and I always insisted on having an odd number in the debate.
Do you know why? Because I wanted to be center. I didn't want there to be two people center, right? Does that make ... Does that make sense? It makes sense. And during our rallies, we always had these massive, the biggest -- the biggest they've ever seen. And I always used to say, "Turn the camera around and show." They never did because they're fake news.
They don't want to show. And I'd always say, "Turn the camera around." And I'll never forget. I went through four or five and they just wouldn't show these massive crowds from the very beginning, right? Right from the beginning. And then what happened is there were some protesters in one rally, like two people that live in a basement of their parents' house.
And I thought the camera was very new and you couldn't change them. You know, they're very rigid. There's steel stuff and you couldn't change them. You couldn't turn the. And then we had a little protest in the back corner which was impossible for a camera to see. And those cameras, they looked like pretzels the way they turned.
When they saw trouble, they were able to turn, but that's the way the press treats us and I hope you show the real crowd that's here today. And I hope you show ... And I hope you show the thousands of people that are in other part of the airport watching this on television. Thousands and thousands of additional people.
They'll say, "President Trump and former president Obama had wonderful crowds." Let's sort of -- let's sort of come in. But this election will decide whether we build on this extraordinary prosperity that we've created. Did you see the numbers on Friday? Did you see those numbers? Or whether we let the radical Democrats take a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to our future.
America now has the best economy in the history of our country. And it can be destroyed very quickly. That's why you have to get to the polls. In the last month alone, we added 250,000 jobs and that is despite the hurricane, which also hit a chunk of Georgia. Those Georgia farmers, I met with them. I was with Sonny Perdue... our great Agricultural Secretary and I met with a lot of the farmers and these are great people.
I'll never forget it, actually. These are great, great people and one of them said, "Sir, I've been growing cotton for 25 years. This is the best crop I've ever grown. I had some problems over the last two or three years, but this is going to take care of all of my problems." And then the hurricane came and in four hours there was nothing left and it was true.
There was nothing. It was gone. All the best cotton that I've ever grown. Now, I assume that's a man that knows cotton and I'm saying what does the best cotton mean? If I ever said that, they'd say, "What is he talking about?" The best cotton I've ever seen. Sounded like Trump actually. But -- but he meant this was the best crop he's ever grown and it was good and then boom, it was gone.
And I told Sonny Perdue who loves you, who was your governor, as you know... and a popular governor. And a popular governor. I guess he'd still be governor if they didn't have term limits. Sonny was a great, popular governor and he's now the Secretary of Agriculture and I told him, "We're helping those farmers in Georgia." And by the way, Alabama got hit.
Florida, did Florida get hit or what? And we're helping them all. We're helping our farmers a lot. In addition to the deal we made with Canada, Mexico, it's a -- we're helping our farmers. We're going to get them over this because they got really hit hard. They got wiped out and we're going to help them.
Great people. Great people. Since election day, we have created 4.5 million new jobs... and we have lifted 4.3 million people off of food stamps. Think of that. Jobless claims in Georgia just fell to their lowest level in 45 years. More Georgia workers are employed today then at any time or any point in American history.
Think of that. You want to see that end quickly? You want to see Georgia prosperity end quickly? Vote for the Democrat. She'll end it quickly. She will end it quickly and she'll double up your taxes and a lot of bad things will happen. We passed a massive tax cut for Georgia families and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle-class.
We're working on that now. Here in Georgia, the great news just keeps rolling in. Jobs are going up. Crime is going down. Wages are rising, first time in many years. You saw that in the report on Friday. Poverty is plummeting and confidence is at an all-time high. Other than that, we're not doing very well.
Under Republican leadership, Georgia is safer, Georgia is stronger and Georgia is winning like never before. And I'll tell you what, I know Brian. He will take it to new heights, heights that you wouldn't even believe. I know him. This guy doesn't stop, which is what you want. He's an incredible manager.
He's been successful all the way up and down the line. This man will bring it to heights that you wouldn't believe, even today with those great numbers. And to protect your rights and freedoms, we overcame the Democrat smear campaign and confirmed the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
[Audience chants Trump] Boy, did he get treated badly. The Democrats treated him so badly, so unfair. And did you see what happened on Friday? You know what I'm talking about,right? They knew -- you knew that before. You knew that these three women, they knew that before. They knew that a long time ago. So, a woman, who accused then Judge Kavanaugh of horrible, horrible crimes... admitted that actually she never met Judge Kavanaugh or Brett Kavanaugh or Kavanaugh period.
Never met him, never saw him and the act never happened and it was a lie. It was a total lie. She made up the story and she was forced to admit it. [Audience chants Lock her up] It was a false accusation, it was a false statement and she was forced to admit it. Can you imagine? This man, for 10 years, I wasn't -- who knew I was going to do this?
I was happily building buildings in Manhattan, having a good time, having a nice, simple life. A nice, simple life ... And then I said to my beautiful first lady ... And I said, "What the hell. Let's give it a shot," and look what happened. Look what happened. And look what happened. Now, and we're doing -- we're doing things for our country that haven't been done in 100 years.
What we're doing, we're turning it around. By the way, when I came in -- actually this happens all the time, but when I came in backstage, a very powerful, strong guy was saying ... [Audience member calls out] Thank you very much. A very, very powerful guy, a big strong guy, with tears coming down on his face said, "Thank you, Mr. President for saving our country." This happens all the time.
This happens all the time. Thank you. Tears, tears. I said, "When was the last time you cried?" He said, "I don't know that I ever cried." Even as a baby, this guy didn't cry, but he was crying backstage. I mean, tears are coming down, thanking me. And it's true. We turned the country around. The country was going down.
But think in terms of Justice Kavanaugh. Think if he didn't get the appointment based on this woman's false accusations. Think of it. Think of it. Just think of it, how horrible that was. I think this was number four. And by the way, what about the other ones? How about the other ones, folks? This was number four.
You'll see others now, but how about the other ones? But, listen to this. So supposing this was the final straw and the Democrats who were -- who were so bad, who were so disrespectful, who were so horrible, right? How about the leak? How about Dianne Feinstein with the leak? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know about the leak Remember?
Remember when she went, "No, I don't know. Did we leak? did we leak?" John Cornyn asked the question. He asked her, boom, "Did you leak?" "No. No, let me check. No. No, we didn't leak. We didn't." I always say that may be the worst body language I've ever seen in my life, right? She leaked. In other words, she leaked.
But it was terrible the way he got treated and now this woman comes forward, says, "I never met him and it was a false story, false statements. I lied." She said, "I lied," and he could have lost a judgeship on a story that was made up and the way the Democrats treated him and us, you've got to get to the polls on Tuesday and you've got to vote.
The contrast in this election could not be more clear. Republicans produce jobs. Democrats produce mobs. You've heard that. You've seen it. You've seen it. You've seen it. Antifa. They the helmet off and they take the arm bands and you see these little arms, you see these little arms. And then you see the clubs in their hands.
You know, they're tough guys, right? Where are the bikers for Trump? Where are the police? Where are the military? Where are the ICE? Where are the border patrol? No. No. We've taken a lot. We've taken a lot, folks. But, you see these guys, you take off their helmet, their black helmet, their black outfit with the pads.
They're all tough guys and they're swinging clubs viciously. They couldn't care less who they hit. These are bad people. These are people causing problems and the press doesn't want to talk about them. If the radical resistance, and that's what they are, radical resistance, takes power, they will move immediately to reverse America's progress and to eradicate all of the gains that we've made.
The Democrat party wants to raise your taxes, restore immediately job killing regulations. They want to take away and destroy your health care because that's what's going to happen, impose socialism and totally erase America's borders. How about that caravan? Do you want to let that caravan just pour in? I don't think so. So we started the wall.
$1.6 billion. Another $1.6 billion just approved. We're building it in pieces and chunks, but I want to build it all at one time. In the meantime, you saw last week I called up the United States military. We're not playing games, folks. There's no games. Because you look at what's marching up, that's an invasion.
That's not -- that's an invasion. And a lot of things happening. You know, ask yourself, how do you think that formed? And did you see the second caravan?And we pay these countries, by the way, Honduras, El Salvador, we pay these countries hundreds of millions of dollars which, by the way, we'll be stopping very soon, OK? They don't do a damn thing.
They don't do a damn thing for us. We called up -- I asked Vice President Mike Pence to call up the head of Honduras, to call up the heads of all -- he called them. He said, "Listen, we don't want you to allow the formation of caravans in your country. We pay you hundreds of millions of dollars a year, which is probably just stolen, and we don't want it. And you know what?
Absolutely, we will fight -- in the meantime, nothing. They do nothing for us. Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of a legal aliens to pour into our country. These are the same caravans that have violently overrun Mexican soldiers and police. You saw this. We're not dealing with babies here, folks.
You know, every time I say, "You have some rough people in there," the media says, "How dare you. We want to see proof." Well, they gave you 300 names yesterday. These are rough, rough people in many cases and if they're allowed to breakthrough our borders, only larger and bigger, we have emboldened these people.
It's not going to happen. And by the way, you saw how good our military -- they got off those planes. I had so many calls and I had so many people ... And we look at those soldiers and you saw that barbed wire going up, that barbed wire. Yes, sir. We have barbed wire going up because you know what? We're not letting these people invade our country.
We want them to come in. We want them to come in, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in legally. And that's why I'm sending a message today to the caravans, to the criminals, to the human traffickers -- do you believe, human trafficking, because of the internet. is more prevalent today than it ever was in the history of our world.
This is a worldwide, unbelievable problem. Who would think we're talking about this? You think of that from 500 years ago. Because of the internet, worse today than it's ever been. And we're not letting in the smugglers. So turn back now because you're not coming into the United States unless you go through the process.
Turn back. So if you want more caravans and you want more crime, vote Democrat. It's very simple. If you want strong borders and safe communities, vote Republican. And by the way, I saw him backstage. I said I'm going to bring him out just for a second. He's a really good guy. I met him years ago and I know you really like him.
He's a Georgia legend who truly knows about winning. He led the Georgia team to a national championship. Coach Vince Dooley. Vince, come up here, coach.
Thank you. President Trump, thanks for coming to Georgia and supporting Brian Kemp for our governor. Brian grew up with our family. We have known him since he was 10-15 years old. My wife's best friend is Brian's mother. A football player, my son, played side-by-side as the offensive guard and tackle with a total weight of about 180 pounds a piece.
They weren't going kill them today. But President Trump, thanks for keeping your promises.
Thank you, coach. Thank you.
Thanks for all you've done and God bless America. And one other thing. I talked to Herschel ... And Herschel Brian -- Herschel supports Brian and you'll be hearing from him in the next day or two. He's going to be here. God bless America.
Thank you, coach. Thank you, coach. And the coach is right about the great Herschel Walker. He has given me his support from day one and I understand he just endorsed Brian. And Herschel, you couldn't stop Herschel. Remember that? I remember in his day at Georgia, they wrote a ballad, right? The ballad to Herschel Walker.
It was pretty easy to coach that team, though, coach. What you did is you took the snap and handed it to Herschel. Ten yards, 10 yards, 20 yards, 30 yards. And then everyone on that team went into the NFL. They said, well -- but I'll tell you, Herschel Walker's been great and he's been a tremendous friend of all of us. And that was some football player.
And you have a great team this year, but... but -- but having Herschel, wouldn't be bad, right? Having Herschel. Thank you very much. And we're grateful to be joined also by a man who's really done a terrific job as your governor, Nathan Deal. Nathan? Thank you, Nathan. Thank you, Nathan. Nathan Deal. Thank you, Nathan.
And here with us today is a man we all know. He has been such a tremendous help to me and the United States Senate. Whenever there's something tough, everybody tends tends to go to David Perdue because he gets it done. Thank you, David. Thank you very much. Thanks, David. What a great guy. And also Sonny Perdue.
Where is Sonny? Where is Sonny? Where the hell -- Sonny, you've done a great job. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Sonny. Great job, sonny. We're going to get the money for those farmers in Georgia, Sonny? We may have to come up with some new rules, but we'll get you there, right, Sonny? We'll get you there because what's not -- you know, it's amazing.
You know what's amazing? We give billions and billions of dollars to these foreign countries that don't give a damn about us and we can't get a couple of bucks to farmers that got wiped out by a hurricane and we're going to take care of our farmers ... In Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, OK? I just put a lot of pressure on Sonny, but he can handle it, right?
He can handle it, David, right? And we are joined by many fantastic Republican members of Congress. I hear they're all doing very well. They don't even have to be introduced. They're doing really well, but you know what? Let's not take a chance. Go out and vote. I've heard before how well people are doing and then, you know, people say, "We don't have to. They're doing so well," and then bad things happen.
Go out and vote. Congressman Buddy Carter ... Buddy, thank you, Buddy. Thank you, Buddy. A terrific guy. All of them. These people helped us so much with tax cuts and regulation cuts. Congressman Drew Ferguson. Drew ... Thanks, Drew. Great job, Drew. Austin Scott. Thanks, Austin. He's got the make farmers great again hat.
He's got the green hat. That's called make farmers great again. That's what we've done with our new deals with Canada, with South Korea, with Mexico. Remember, they said we wouldn't get them done? We got them done and they understood, if we didn't get them done, we were just going to have to tariff all their product coming in, so we got them done.
And they were great Jody Hice. Jody. Great job. Thank you for all of the help. Thanks, Jody. Great job. Barry Loudermilk. Barry. These are all guys -- they're winning by so much. Usually, I have to tell long stories about each one. In other words, get -- with these guys -- but you still want people to get out and vote, right?
right, Barry? Rick Allen. Rick. Rick. Thanks, Rick. Thanks, Rick. And Tom Graves. Great people. Thank you, Tom. Thank you. You have great people. If you don't want to be saying "Speaker Pelosi" for the next two years... get out and vote. And I will tell you, you don't hear this thing too much about the blue wave anymore, do you notice?
You know, about a month ago, two months ago, I was hearing about this horrendous blue wave. It's going to sweep us all out. It's going to be terrible. I haven't heard the term "blue wave," but you better get out and vote, otherwise I'm going to look very bad with this statement, right? This Tuesday, the people of Georgia are going to head to the polls to choose your next governor and I think most of you know how important that decision will be. Brian Kemp is an incredible fighter and a tireless champion for the people and for the values of Georgia and he was with me right from the beginning.
I read an article. They said, "He was with Trump from the moment he was Donald Trump and Melania come down the escalator in Trump Tower. That's when he was with him." I like those people. He will keep your jobs and wages rising, which is what's happening. He will provide great schools and health care for your loved ones and he will keep your family safe.
So important. Brian will always stand behind our military and he has. He will stand behind our vets. More importantly, he loves our vets. He's talked to -- he talks to me about the vets. He talks to me about the vets a lot. Sometimes I say, "Brian, we've got to talk about another subject. Please, Brian." And we got Veterans' Choice passed, by the way.
He's always behind our police and our law enforcement and he will never let anything bad happen to our second amendment, which, believe me, is under siege. Our second amendment. Our second amendment. If Stacey Abrams gets in, your second amendment is... is gone, gone. Stacey and her friends will get rid of it. You wouldn't mind if somebody comes knocking on your door, "Please, I'd like to have your guns turned over to government." Take your guns away.
Please give us all guns right now. Brian's opponent, Stacey Abrams, is one of the most extreme, far left politicians in the entire country. You know that. She wants to raise your income tax very substantially. She wants to raise your property tax very substantially, right through the roof. She supports a socialist takeover of health care which means you will never be able to see your doctor, just like the vets never got to see their doctor and just like President Obama -- I'm going to be very nice -- did not tell the truth when he says you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.
He said it 28 times ... And it wasn't true. You put Stacey in there and you're going to have Georgia turn into Venezuela. I don't think the people of Georgia like that. And Stacey Abrams, and I spoke to law enforcement, I spoke to everybody, is really weak on crime, really weak on crime. That's not what you need.
She wants to end the death penalty... for even the most vicious and ruthless killers. Stacey Abrams voted against tougher penalties for violent criminals who assault our police officers. Stacey Abrams wants to turn your wonderful state into a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens... putting innocent Georgia families at the mercy of hardened criminals and predators.
Abrams voted in favor of allowing illegal aliens to receive public benefits. That's wonderful. She even -- listen to this -- voted to let illegal aliens hold public office. Isn't that wonderful? And Stacey Abrams wants illegal aliens to vote. You know, that's one of the big deals here. They like them coming in because we're winning and they figure if enough of them come in, eventually they'll be able to vote and they're going to vote for the Democrats, right?
We can't let this happen. For other reasons, too, but we can't let that happen. She opposed requiring proof of American citizenship at the ballot box... and she recently said she wants illegal aliens to be part of her blue wave. I think her blue wave's not going to happen. And she brought Oprah here to help her.
And you know, Oprah was a friend of mine until I ran for office. Once I ran for office, we diverged slightly. In fact. you know what? I think the media will check this. Look at all those cameras. That's terrible. A lot of people said, it should be frightening every day having to speak in front -- and they're looking.
One little mistake, one little stutter, one little accidentally saying a wrong word, it's a major headline. It's a major headline. One little ... One little, tiny -- a little bit of a mispronunciation of a word, it's front-page news all over the world. You know what? You know what? The bottom line, just don't make any mistakes.
[Audience chants CNN Sucks] But anyway, so Oprah -- and Oprah's been down to Mar-a-Lago and honestly, we did. Until I ran for office, we were actually -- we did very well. We had a good relationship and I like Oprah. But you know what you don't know? Oprah, when she ended her show, had her five most important people, I assume, her last week.
You remember the last week? Well, I was on her full show in the last week. I think they're trying to burn the tape. Are they trying to burn the tape? But Oprah was here to endorse Stacey and I'm here to endorse Brian. And you know what? I hope you're going to listen to my endorsement. Stacey Abrams will make your schools and neighborhoods unsafe and she will make your jobs disappear like magic.
You know the magic wands that President Obama said, "You'll never get your manufacturing jobs back. You'd need a magic wand." Well, we did. We did. But all of these reasons and maybe the best reason of all, he's a great leader, he's a strong man, he's a strong personality, which you need, and he is somebody that will be a great governor of Georgia.
Brian Kemp, please come up. [Audience chants Kemp]
Wow. Thank you so much. Well, thank you, Mr. President. We're so glad that you have Georgia on your mind. I was -- I was just thinking backstage about my opponents had -- you know, Obama and Hillary and Elizabeth Warren ... But we've got -- we've got Trump, Pence ... So we got -- we got Trump, Pence, Vince Dooley and Herschel Walker, the goal line stalker.
Mr. President, I do, on behalf of hard-working Georgians, want to thank you for your response to Hurricane Michael. I was on the ground down there, as you were and the Vice President was and Secretary Perdue, and I've never been more prouder to be a Georgian, to see the federal, state and local response to our brothers and sisters in need.
Thank you very much. As you know, my opponent doesn't think a whole lot about farmers and people that work in hospitality, but you sure do. We also want to thank you for the tax cuts. That's right. Because of that, with the leadership of Governor Deal, taxes were cut in Georgia last year and with your help, I'm going to do it again next year.
We also appreciate you taking a chainsaw to government regulations at the federal level. Because of that, we are having record unemployment, record job growth, and I want to thank you for your huge endorsement in the primary. It made a big difference, as you remember. But I want to... but I want to thank you all for supporting -- I want to thank you all for supporting our President and I want to thank our President for standing up and fighting for our country and fighting for hard-working Georgians.
But as you ... [Audience chants USA] But as you -- as you all know, many times the states are the laboratories of democracy and the President needs some help at the state level from time to time. So I want to encourage you all to get out and vote on Tuesday, to talk to your friends, talk to your neighbors, get the vote out.
We will go to work as Georgia Republicans like we've done over the last 16 years under Governor Sonny Perdue's leadership and Governor Nathan Deal's leadership and we'll work hard with this president to continue to make America great again. Thank you.
Beautiful. Wow. [Audience chants Kemp] But it is true. I generally have been working for getting great senators elected, been working with David and everybody else, but we're going for the senators. We do whatever we can for the congressmen and women and we've done that. But I haven't done too much for governors.
This is an important race for Georgia. I'm here -- I am here for Brian because the governor of Georgia means so much to our country, our country. So you've got to get out there. You've got to get out there. And this is a very worthwhile stop. In addition, I happen to like the people of Georgia very much, so it's not so bad.
It gives me a good excuse to say hello. If Democrats gain power on Tuesday, one of their very first projects will be the socialist takeover of American health care. You know what that means? It means long waits... and bad service and a lot of problems. And we'll go over that because they possibly will come up with that hopefully in their campaign.
The remaining left-leaning person, they'll come up with that and you'll see what happens. You will not be happy. The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare, it'll eliminate Medicaid Advantage for more than 635,000 Georgia seniors who depend on it. Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it. And by the way, people don't realize this, who have paid for it. Thank you.
And very importantly, Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. We're doing it. But Democrats like to spread false rumors. They're the ones that won't be able to because there will be nothing left when your system is obliterated. The Democrats plan to destroy health care. Also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for all of the illegal immigrants that they want to pour into our country.
As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders and destroy our nation, essentially, because, you know what? Without borders, we don't have a nation. We don't have a nation. The incredible thing, is over the years, we've been fighting so hard for other countries' borders, but we don't protect our own border, but we're protecting it now.
Even with the worst laws -- they are the worst laws. They have given us so little and the Democrats don't want to change the laws because they want this chaos at the borders. They think it's good politically. I personally think it's backfiring on them and I think maybe they made a big mistake. Illegal immigration costs our country far more then $100 billion every single year.
That's more than double the entire state budget of Georgia. And illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers, including African-American and Hispanic-American. You know that. African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American workers -- not fair. Not only do the Democrats' open border policies drain our treasury, but they endanger every American community and you see that.
You see what's going on. Nearly 100 percent of the heroin in the United States enters through the southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, the majority of meth and a substantial portion of the ultra lethal fentanyl killing our youth. These drugs have destroyed hundreds of thousands of lives last year and killed, last year alone, 70,000 Americans.
And they don't want to toughen up the immigration laws. I think they're going to do very poorly at the ballot box, but I may be wrong. And they want to get rid of ICE. Elizabeth Warren wants to get rid of -- I don't -- I can't call her Pocahontas anymore because she has no Indian blood. It's a problem. She has no Indian blood.
I have more than she has and I have none. And I said that a long time ago, before I got -- before she brilliantly sent out the test results. That was not a good test, Elizabeth. That will be great leadership when dealing with North Korea, China, Russia, all of these countries that you have to deal with. That was not good.
Is she still running for president, Brian? Is she still ... I'll tell you, she is pushing a guy up -- a guy up in Ohio who will be a disaster for the state. We want Mike DeWine -- do you know, she's pushing somebody named Cordray in Ohio. He is a disaster. He's worse than she is. Last year alone -- and Ohio was just too smart.
DeWine -- Ohio, if you're listening, DeWine -- they must be listening with all those cameras. DeWine, he'll make a great -- he'll make a great governor. So important. The governorships -- people really don't realize how important governorships are. I mean, they can destroy your state or make your state -- its state really great again.
They can destroy it, and quickly, or make it even better. Last year alone, our brave ICE officers arrested 127,000 aliens with criminal records. Think of that. Including those charged or convicted of approximately 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes and 1,800 murders. Now, do you believe those numbers? And by the way, ICE, these are really tough people, but they're great.
They love our country and they are going in to towns and cities and places and they are throwing MS-13 gang members the hell out of our country by the thousands, by the thousands. And nobody here wants that job. That's a tough job, but they like it and they do it great. And we're going to protect them. The Democrats want to abolish ICE.
They want to release drug dealers and MS-13 gang members. Remember when Nancy Pelosi got angry at me because she thought I didn't speak well of MS-13 gang members? They cut them up. They go straight into your neighborhoods. We believe that any politician that puts criminal aliens before American citizens needs to be voted out of office very quickly or certainly not voted into office.
Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE, the border patrol and law enforcement. And you have great law enforcement in the state of Georgia. That I can tell you. This election is about safety and this election is about jobs. For years, you watched as we let foreign countries plunder our wealth, shut our factories and decimate our industries.
You were victims of it. Many of you were victims of it, but those days are over. We've added nearly a half a million manufacturing jobs and that's going up to almost 600,000 very shortly. Remember, they were the jobs that won't happen anymore. They were the jobs that we would have needed the magic wand. They'll never be brought back.
I'll tell you what, they are. They're among the best jobs any state or country could have and they're pouring in. Last month alone, we added 32,000 manufacturing jobs. That's 1,000 manufacturing jobs every single day. Nobody thought that was possible. I recently announced that we are replacing the horrible NAFTA deal with an incredible brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.
The USMCA is a giant victory for Georgia farmers, manufacturers and dairy producers. A tremendous -- and they said it wouldn't happen. It happened. We're opening them up. We've taken the toughest ever action to crackdown on China's abusive trade practices and we're doing very well. That's something that could also happen and if it doesn't happen, we're going to do very well too.
After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. Thank you. Because we are now putting America first. We have also taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs, Secretary Azar. You'll see them come down. You saw a month ago when the drug companies rose their prices very substantially and I said, "Get me the name of the head of Pfizer and Novartis," and I made some calls.
And they immediately dropped their price. "Yes, Mr. President. No, we were only kidding when we gave you that price, sir. We were only kidding, Mr.," -- and that's when I realized how powerful the presidency is. True. No, I thank Pfizer for doing that and Novartis and the others. They did it and it was great.
But you're going to see prices coming down. We're cutting out the middleman, the middleman and woman, I guess, right? We're cutting the middleman and the middlewoman and you know what? I'm going to have a lot of people that hate me really badly, almost as bad as the left, almost as bad as the Democrats, if that's possible.
Almost as bad as the Democrats, but you know what we'll do? We'll blame Russia, OK? We're going to blame Russia. OK? Let's blame Russia. After years of soaring Obamacare premiums, average premiums in Georgia this year are coming down. We're bringing them down. And what did we do? We got rid of the individual mandate which was a disaster for people.
And we very much defanged it and we're running it properly and it's being every week, more and more. We're doing a good job and you notice your premiums are not doing as badly as you ever thought. It's a lot better than you would have thought. We have defanged it and really -- it's being decimated. We actually had it repealed and replaced, but we had one disappointing vote and we didn't get one vote from a Democrat.
We didn't get one vote from a Democrat. Slightly -- that was a slightly disappointing vote, folks, but it doesn't matter because we're now doing it a little bit differently. We're doing it piecemeal and it's working out just fine. We've just introduced new, affordable health care plans for Georgia, individual markets that only cost about half the price of Obamacare and it's, frankly, better insurance.
We passed Veterans' Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor rather than waiting on line for 10 days, for 20 days, for three months. They see a doctor, they take care of their -- I mean, literally, I say this all the time, people that were modestly ill, it takes them weeks and weeks to see a doctor and by the time they get there, they're terminal.
Think of it. I mean, think of how horrible. Now, they go out, they see a doctor, they take care of themselves, we pay the bill and that's good. Our veterans. That's for our veterans. And not that it matters in this case because the only thing that matters is the vet, but it also happens to save us a lot of money, if you can believe it. They get rid of this big problem and it saves us a lot of money.
You know, they're waiting on line. Sometimes they wait three, four weeks. Can you imagine you can't see your doctor for three or four weeks? And longer. And we also passed the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure everyone and anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable and the minimum we do is say, you're fired.
That's the minimum. We secured $716 billion, and last year $700 billion, to fully rebuild our great United States military. And we gave our incredible warriors their largest pay raise in more than a decade. And at my direction, the pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the american armed forces, the Space Force, which we need.
Which we need badly. We need badly. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. And Iran's been a much different country. Has Iran been a different country for the last six months? Isn't that incredible? When I came in, it was just a question of how long would it take them to take over the whole Middle East.
They were going to look for the Mediterranean. That was a long ways -- they were for the Mediterranean. They're not looking anymore for the Mediterranean. We have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We have made extraordinary progress in so many ways, and yet we're just getting started.
But the Democrats want to throw America in reverse and drag us backward to the failures and betrayals of the past, and that's what they were. You look at what's happened to our country over the last long period of time, we are going and were going in the wrong direction. But you know, now, when I have meetings with foreign leaders, with kings and queens and princes, and we meet on occasion with a president and prime minister, every one of them comes into the oval office, practically, and they say, before anything else, "I want to congratulate you on the incredible job you've done with the economy of the United States." Pretty amazing.
And we're ahead of schedule, but I need you to vote for a Republican governor and a Republican congress and we have to get all of those votes. You know, this is the greatest political movement in the history of our country. I don't know if you know it. It is. And we're all a part of it. It's not me. It's all of us. We're together.
But this is the greatest political movement in the history of our country, maybe ever. There's never been anything like this, but we have to keep going because the changes we've made are incredible. [Audience chants six more years] Thank you very much. Now, what we've done in a short period of time -- we're way ahead of schedule, as you know, but we've got it turned and we're starting to really -- it's really getting better and better and we're learning our way around Washington like you wouldn't believe.
It can be a nasty place, but the things we've done -- things we've done -- and everybody says it, including the Democrats when they're are not on television or not talking to a mic. They cannot believe what we've done and they want to stop it as fast as possible, and we're not going to let that happen. With your support, we will keep on cutting your taxes, reducing your regulations and raising up your incomes, which have already gone up a lot over the last two years.
We will protect Medicare and we will protect your social security, just like I've been saying during the debates, right? I talked about your social security and everybody said, we're going to change. Well, I was the one that said we're not, and guess what? There haven't been any changes. We will defend your right to free speech, religious liberty and we will continue to confirm judges who will interpret the constitution of the United States as written.
Two judges. How about Justice Neil Gorsuch? Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh, two great people, two great intellects, two great scholars. These are the people we need on our Supreme Court. We will fully secure the borders ... [Audience member calls out I love you] Thank you. I love you, too, darling.
Accept this. That was a guy, wasn't it? Yes. I love -- I love you anyway. Thank you. Thank you. We will pass case Kate's Law, stop sanctuary cities, stop catch and release and the ridiculous visa lottery and chain migration and we will keep the criminals, traffickers, drug dealers and terrorists the hell out of our country.
We're going to keep them out. We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependents to independence and poverty to prosperity. For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America. They apologized. I saw it, you saw it. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America. We're standing up for your values, we're standing up for Georgia and we are proudly standing up for our national anthem.
I'm asking every citizen from every party, every background -- go ahead. All right. [Audience chants USA] It sounded too good. I had to let them go forward. I don't think we could have stopped them anyway, do you? Good job. Good job. Thank you, fellas. I'm asking every citizen from every party, every background and every race, color, and creed to reject the Democrat politics and the policies of anger and division and to reclaim our proud and righteous destiny as Americans.
I need you to get your family, to get your friends, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and to go out and vote Republican. We're going to do it. We're going to do it. This Tuesday, I need the people of Georgia to send a message to crying Chuck Schumer... Nancy Pelosi... and the legendary Maxine Waters... and all of the radical Democrats by electing Brian Kemp as your next governor.
Loyal citizens like you helped build this country and together, we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people. We stand on the shoulders of brave Americans who crossed the oceans, tamed the wilderness, secured our independence, won two world wars and planted our great flag on the face of the moon.
American patriots defeated fascism, vanquished communism, delivered millions into freedom and built the greatest country and most powerful military in the history of our world. These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, tear down our industry and destroy our proud American heritage.
We didn't do it. From the farm fields of Georgia to the big sky of Montana... from the deserts of Nevada to the everglades of Florida, from the coal mines of West Virginia to the steel mills of Indiana and in every city and town across our land, we are going to work, we are going to fight and we are going to win, win, win.
We will not bend, we will not break, we will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, we will never surrender and we will always fight on to victory, victory, victory. Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God.
And Georgia, together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Georgia. Thank you.
Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Wow. I will never ever let you down, that I can tell you. Amazing. And I want to thank Manchester and New Hampshire are very special. You remember those primaries, that primary came around and remember what happened during the primary? Trump should come in third or fourth, and we came in easily No. 1, and that was the beginning.
That was an easy one. I want to thank you all. This is incredible, and it's great to be back in a state that I love with thousands of hardworking patriots, who are the heart and soul of America and that's what you are. And we're actually here today to officially launch our campaign to win the great state of New Hampshire in 2020. And I saw some fake polls put out by the fake news media and had said that I'm tied, I'm tied with three of the other candidates, the Democrats.
I'm tied in New Hampshire. I don't think so. One of them has a rally, he's got a hundred people. So this holds 12,000. We're full and we could fill it up four times, at least. We could fill it up four times, but I just want to thank you all. I just think it's going to be a tremendous four years. We're going to have a tremendous four years.
Can you believe it? We only have a little more than a year to go where it all started, right? The greatest movement in the history of our country, the greatest political movement in the history of our country. And even though we had fake witch hunts on our back and all the other things that we had to go through, we have taken this big, beautiful ship and it's being turned around very quickly.
Three years ago, we campaigned across the country on a pledge to make America great again and that's exactly what we've done. I think we can honestly say it's the greatest slogan in the history of politics in America, right? make America great again. So if you don't mind, you know, the other candidates go, they spend millions and millions of dollars on this question that I'm going to ask you, they spend millions.
You remember the first slogan from our opponents? That's right, neither do I, neither does anybody. I don't either. Nobody remembers. The only thing I remember is the first night I went out after I heard it and I said, "See, it's all about her." And they immediately changed it after spending like a million dollars.
They said, it's all about her that didn't work out too well. That slogan wasn't too good, so we have to do this. We have to make a decision. You give up the greatest slogan in the history of politics in our country, make America great again, right? So do we give up make America great again for a new slogan, because look our country is doing great, we are doing very well with China, despite the fact that they want to have you believe through the contrary.
All you have to do is say, China, how you doing? They're not too happy, they're not too happy. They're losing millions of jobs. The tariffs are working and they're eating the tariffs by the way. There's no price increase. You know, you've got to talk to these people, the fake news, but do we give up -- and by the way, the biggest beneficiary, you know who have been great?
Our great farmers have been so incredible because they've been targeted by China. And frankly, they've been targeted for a long time, including by incompetent politicians that have run this country for a long time. So we're making up for a lot of lost ground. But do we give up make America great again for keep America great, keep America great.
OK, you ready? Ready? I love this because it's free and we have all the time in the world, right? Is there anything better than a Trump rally? What about a sleepy Joe Biden rally? Right? Boy, he's made some beauties. I sort of hope it's him. I don't mind any of them. You got Pocahontas' rising, you got Kamala, Kamala is falling.
You got Beto, Beto is like, but we'll see what happens. Whoever -- you know, whoever it is. I don't know that it matters, but whoever it is, different, different people. But I don't know, I think sleepy Joe may be able to limp across the finish line. But today they announced that they're going to cut way back on his appearances because he is such a disaster, they're going to have fewer appearances.
You've heard that, right? This is certain. They're going to cut way back on his appearances. Can you believe it? If I ever did that, it would be over. The fake news would get us, but we don't let him get us and it is fake. And today, the deputy editor of The New York Times was demoted. Is that beautiful?
Is that beautiful? All the news that's not fit to print, you know. So all the news, the fake failing New York Times. So why do I go with -- where do we go? You know, it's really we, it's not me. We're doing it together. They came from the hills. They came from the mountains, from the rivers. They came from all over the place and they showed up and they voted like nobody's seen before, and it was 306 to 223, remember?
306. And we won Wisconsin. And they said, Oh, we never thought of that, got to think about those thing. And we won Michigan and now we have a lot of car companies coming into Michigan and we have a lot of great farming events happening really big in Wisconsin, and we have incredible things going on in Pennsylvania.
We just opened up a $10 billion plant. We have many of them going up, many of them, lot of jobs. Spending in Louisiana an LNG plant $10 billion. Could never have happened, could never have happened. Pennsylvania would have never happened. They wouldn't have allowed him to frack, so they would have never been able to build it. But what a place that is. It will be open in a little more than a year, but I have to make a decision.
It's a big decision. Do we give up the greatest theme phrase, logo, whatever you want to call it in the history of politics? Risky? For a brand new one because make America great again, we're really sort of there, and we have a little time left, right? And now we have a group of socialists or communists could be, could be. They're not far away.
Now the fake news will hit me on that. How dare he say that. But they're not far away right, right? They're not far away. 95% -- does anybody want to pay 95% tax in the room? I don't think so. I don't think so. So -- but I'm not going to go into their plan because, as far as I'm concerned, the green new deal is a beautiful thing.
No, it's a beautiful thing. We wanted to continue onward until about a month before the election. I will let them have it like you've never heard before. I don't want them to change. Wow, it's like Elizabeth Warren. I did the Pocahontas thing. I hit her really hard and it looked like she was down and out, but that was too long ago.
I should have waited, but don't worry, we will revive it. It can be revived. It can be -- right? It will be revived and it can be revived very easily and very quickly and we're going to have some fun in the state of New Hampshire. Now, what do we do ready? Let me have first, make America great again, then keep America great, right?
Just applaud like crazy for the one you want to use for this campaign. And there's a possibility we'll use both. There's a possibility we'll use both because I hate like hell, I hate like hell to give up the one. Is there a possibility we'll use both? Maybe one a little bit less? Are you ready? So we'll start make America great again and then keep America great, right?
Are you ready? Who's in favor of the campaign theme being, make America great again? Who's in favor of our theme being, keep America great? So wait a minute! This is your hat. I was going to keep it actually. Thank you. Thank you. So that's really been the reaction. I've done this before big crowds and it really is keep America great because we have these socialists want to take it away from us. They want to take it away.
So it works -- because until a couple of days ago and that will catch up very quickly. We have no choice. By the way, I never said China was going to be easy, but it's not tough and they want to make a deal. We just spoke to them yesterday. They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. They have to make a deal.
And you know what, it will be wonderful to make a deal. I don't think we're ready to make a deal. We're taking in billions of dollars in tariffs and again, China's devaluing their currency. They're pouring out money. The prices haven't gone up, so that means we're taking in billions of dollars. We're not paying for it. And ultimately, they're devaluations are going to hurt them very badly.
They want to make a deal and they should want to make a deal. But when you listen to the fake news, look at how many there are. I mean I actually had something today, I had something today. Are we sure that we're in New Hampshire? You know you have a reputation, I mean, I know it's not true because I know you too well.
You have a reputation of being very staid, very, very elegant, staid, incredible people. You're not acting it tonight and that's good. That's a good thing. We love our country. We have enthusiasm for our country, right? That's what it is. That's what it is. That's what it is. Before the election, our factories were closing.
Hey, who knows it better than you? You're like central casting for the closing of factories. Our jobs were vanishing. Our military was totally depleted. When I took over, our military was sad. We weren't flying half of our planes. They were old. They were tired. Our equipment was tired. Our people weren't tired, though.
Our people weren't tired. But everything we had was depleted. Now we've rebuilt our military like never before. And all made in the USA to say, you know, and our nation was weakened at home and disrespected abroad. They don't disrespect us anymore, folks. I got NATO to pay an extra $100 billion. They weren't paying.
They were delinquent. Many nations were, except for seven, many nations weren't paying what they were supposed to be paying. So we're supposed to protect them. They kill us on trade. They have all sorts of barriers and everything else. The taxes are really unfair. The tariffs were ridiculous. What they do to us in Europe and then we protect them, then they don't pay.
And I say, I'm sorry, folks, you have to pay. You have to pay. They were delinquent. They were delinquent and my biggest fan is Secretary General Stoltenberg from NATO. He said, until President Trump came along, we were going boom. They would have been finished very quickly. But I'm tired of paying for other nations anyway.
I have to be honest with you. And today, our nation is stronger than ever before. We're now stronger than ever before. You saw we ended the Iran disaster. How about that? We paid them $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash. Cash, cash, cash. We got nothing. And they also want to make a deal. China wants to make a deal.
And I will tell you, Iran wants to make a deal because the sanctions are not good for them. They are not happy. So we'll see how it all turns out, but it's in good hands. It's in good hands. The United States right now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world. We're rebuilding that awesome might that we were just talking about, our United States armed forces.
America is working again, America is winning again and America is respected again, respected like never before. They respect us again, and you see it. You know, a recent poll came out where it showed that President Obama was more popular in Germany and other places than I am. And I said, Of course, he's more popular.
He's not demanding that they pay for their protection that we provide. He's not doing that. I'm doing that. And in fact, if I was the most popular, I'm not doing my job right, OK? So true. We've created over six million new jobs since the election. If I would have said that during the campaign those people back there would have been headlines, headlines.
More than 7 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Since my election, the number of new businesses, starting in the great state of New Hampshire, has skyrocketed by almost 25%. And you can't really go by my election. You've got to go by November 9th because you know the markets have gone through the roof since November 9th. That's the day after I won the election.
So I won the election, the markets went up thousands of points. Things started happening. You started doing things that you would have never, even though I didn't get sworn in until January 20th, but they refused to do that. And let me tell you, if for some reason I wouldn't have won the election, these markets would have crashed and that will happen even more so in 2020. See the bottom line is, I know you like me and this room is a love fest, I know that, but you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401(k)s down the tubes, everything is gonna be down the tubes.
So whether you love me or hate me, you got to vote for me. I had a business man the other day, one of the most successful guys in the country. I've never liked him, never liked them. He never liked me, I never liked him. I see him in the White House, I said, what are you doing here? He said, I'm working to make sure you get elected.
I said you've got to be kidding. You don't like me, I don't like you. What the hell is this all about? He said, that's right, we've had our differences. I haven't liked you, but to be honest with you, Mr. President, I have no choice. I said, you're right, you're right. First thing I've ever heard him say that I agreed with him.
He's got no choice. He got no choice. Unemployment in New Hampshire has reached the lowest rate in actually 31 years. But within a very short period of time, it will be the lowest rate in the history of our country. So think of that, you have the best unemployment, you have the most successful state in the history of your state and in the history of our country, and then you gonna vote for somebody else.
Oh great. Let's vote for Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren. We have the best numbers we've ever had. Let's vote for somebody else. I don't think that's going to happen, folks. I don't think that's going to happen. Only with fixed polls does that happen. Unemployment for African-Americans, you've heard me say this many times, I'm very proud of it. Hispanic, Americans and Asian Americans have all reached their lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country.
Wages are rising quickly. Remember when I used to say, people have been working two and three jobs making less money than they made 21 years ago. I used to say it all the time. Now I can say, for the first time in 20 years, wages are rising and you know who's the biggest beneficiary? Blue collar workers.
My administration is fighting to expand opportunity for citizens of every background and every race, religion, color and creed, very important. Because we are all Americans, we all share the same home. We all share the same heart. We all share the same dreams. We are all children of the same Almighty God.
But at the very moment, when our country should be coming together to enjoy these wonderful blessings, the radical Democrats are trying to tear America apart. They vilify anyone who doesn't share their extreme views. They slander our law enforcement heroes. You see what they're doing with our police that we love.
You see what they're doing. Has anyone ever seen anything like the water being thrown on New York's finest? Have you ever seen them? And I know a lot of New York's finest, they're not happy,they're, not happy, and they are great people. These are great, great, proud people. For that to be allowed to happen is a disgrace.
They view everybody as fascists and Nazis. They used the term Nazi. This was a term, you couldn't even use it. Now they use it like on a regular basis, a Nazi. He's a Nazi. Think of that. He's a Nazi. You couldn't use it, now they use it. They accuse our heroic border agents of running concentration camps and they do an incredible job, and the Democrats don't want to fix the loopholes or asylum.
They do an incredible job, our border agents. And they look down upon the hardworking citizens who truly make our country run. But while the Democrats rage and rages -- that guy has got a serious weight problem. Go home, start exercising. Get him out of here, please. Got a bigger problem than I do. Got a bigger problem than all of us. Now he goes home and his mom says, what the hell have you just done?
We are continuing our incredible movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country. There's never been a movement like this. Never. Our movement is built on love and it is and we love our families. We love our faith, we love our flag and we love our freedom and that's what it's about.
And add to that the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our country. Together, we are all united by one fundamental principle. A nation's first duty must always be to its own citizens. Its own. We got to take care of our own. You haven't heard that from a politician or a political leader in a long time.
It's called America first. It's America first. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many tremendous Republican leaders and great friends of mine, a man who's doing an incredible job as your governor, because I want to take 100% of the credit for the incredible turnaround of New Hampshire. And I remember it not so long ago, things were not looking good, people were leaving, a lot of bad things were happening, but we have to give him a lot of credit.
He's been a great governor, Chris Sununu, with a great father too, great father. With a great father. His father was tough. Chris, your father was so tough. He was for somebody else in the primers and then one by one, I won here, I won there, I won there. And then when I won, his father governor, I said, oh, this guy kills me. He's so tough.
And he said, President Trump will be the greatest of all time. He said -- I said, what happened, what happened? He went from being the toughest critic to the best there is. So I want to say hello to your father. OK, Chris, you'll tell him. Great guy. What a family. What a family. Thank you, Chris. New Hampshire Senate Republican Leader Chuck Morse.
Chuck, thanks Chuck. New Hampshire House Republican Leader Dick Hinch. Thank you Dick. Thank you Dick. Great job. A man who is with me right from the beginning. In fact, he had a meeting at his house. His house has never been the same. His house is a disaster now. In fact, somebody said he just sold it, but you know what, because of the Trump economy, I'll bet he sold it for a big, big fat, beautiful profit.
Where is Steve? Steve Stepanek and his life was incredible. Did you make a lot of money on the house? And we destroyed the house. This was the beginning. He held some kind of a meeting for me and he has a nice house, but literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people showed up and they destroyed this house.
It's never been the same. No wonder you sold it. They finally gave up. And that was four years ago anyway. Thank you very much both for being here. Appreciate it. What great people. Thank you Steve. Great job. And I hope the buyer of his house didn't hear that little -- Steve, I hope the buyer didn't hear what I just said about your house.
He'll cancel. That's all right, you'll sell it for more to somebody else. Republican Party Chair Ronna McDaniel. You know, Ronna headed up Michigan and for many many years nobody won Michigan as a Republican. But I used to complain and you know I just -- I'd go there and I'd say, they're stealing your car business.
I go for years. In fact, five or six years before I even thought about running, for whatever reason they named me, man of the year in Michigan. I said, how come? I didn't even understand it myself, but I was named man of the year. I wasn't even political. That was years before I did this, but I was always complaining that our car business is being stolen.
I mean it's sort of obvious, right? Mexico now has 32% of our car business. It all left the state of Michigan. We are bringing it back at a level that nobody has ever seen before our car business. But I went to Michigan and my opponent saw that the Republicans, no way you can win Michigan or Wisconsin. That you just can't. And we had a campaign manager named Ronna McDaniel and Ronna wouldn't stop, sir, can you be here next week?
I said, I don't know. Then I leave and she said, sir, can you come back in three days? I said I don't know. Then I do it and she said, how about another time? And then on election night, she said, sir, it was six o'clock the day before the election, in other words, just a short while before the election.
She calls me, sir, can you be here tonight? I said, tonight? And by the way, you know where I was? I was in New Hampshire. That's right. She said, sir, can you be here tonight? I said, are you sure? I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning. Now it's election day, we had 32,000 people show up. It was like this.
The crowd was just they want to see things happen in our country. They love our country. It went crazy and I left. And I said, I don't know why we're going to lose Michigan. Why would we lose Michigan? Look at this and the opponent went there with Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, and she went there much earlier primetime 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock in the morning is not exactly primetime.
So we had 32,000 and they had a tiny little crowd. And I looked at my people and I said, I know we're not supposed to win the great state of Michigan, but I think we're going to win Michigan and we won Michigan and we won Wisconsin. We won Wisconsin. Wisconsin was a great victory and we won Pennsylvania and we Won North Carolina and South Carolina and we won Florida.
And I hate to tell you, we should have won New Hampshire. That was taken away. New Hampshire was taken away. It was taken away from us, but we should have. We did great in New Hampshire. We should have won New Hampshire, but that's OK. I'm not holding it against you because it was not your fault. But we had a woman in Michigan and I said, when it came time to choosing the head of the Republican National Committee.
I said who the hell is that woman up in Michigan that got me to keep coming there and explaining that we can't continue to lose our car business. We have 17 companies now coming back in. Who is that woman? And it was Ronna. We put her in charge of the Republican National Committee. The job that she has done is incredible.
Thank you. And the same with another man, our campaign manager. He started off as a computer genius and remember when they used to say that the Hillary Clinton campaign is highly sophisticated, highly sophisticated. She did a lot of bad things, folks, 33,000 e-mails deleted after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
33,000. Remember she said it was about her daughter's wedding and yoga classes? 33,000, yeah. It was disgraceful. I will tell you this, we now have a great attorney general. A fair guy, a great gentleman. So another man who's here tonight is the world's tallest campaign manager. He is an unbelievable talent.
But they were saying about our opponent, I'm not going to mention the name again because I'll never get my -- we'll never get it finished here. So I'll just say, my opponent, is that better? And they were saying, how sophisticated her campaign was. Except, ours was far more sophisticated and we had a man that did an incredible job and he's now our campaign manager and he's one of the tallest human beings I've ever seen.
And his name is Brad Parscale. It's nice when you don't have to look for anybody. You just look over and you see a guy who's twice as tall as everyone. Great job Brad. Thank you. How we doing Brad? Good, good. Got great poll numbers. We got great poll numbers in a lot of states, Ohio, Iowa. You know, Iowa, every week that they campaign, our numbers go up. They're winning Iowa.
We gave them ethanol, which is very important, a lot of things for Iowa. But every week we seem to be going up in Iowa because they're campaigning in Iowa. Wherever they go, our numbers go up. Somebody is going to have to explain that one to me someday, but we like it. A man who's, a friend of mine, who was the greatest mayor in the history of new York City, stand up, Rudy, Rudy Giuliani.
Man, he did a job, he did a job in the first year. I've never seen anything like it. New York was crime infested, we had problems, we had problems like nobody would believe and Rudy went in there and he did the job and people loved him for it. It wasn't like, oh gee, he's a horrible person. People loved Rudy Giuliani.
He was a great, great mayor. So thank you Rudy for being here. And the first person that I put on on the campaign. He was driving me wild. He said, I'm saying you can win, sir. You can win. I'm telling you, you can win. He loves this state. He's from the state. He said, you can win, sir. I'm just telling you and I had him on for month after month.
He'd come drive me crazy. He say, you can win, you can win, you can win. And finally, we said, let's give it a shot. And I had Corey, I had Hope, I had just a couple of people. We had a rather lean and mean staff, but Corey Lewandowski loves your stay, loves New Hampshire. He was the first one that talked about us, possibly winning the whole big ball game and he's tough and he's smart, and I'm hearing he's thinking about running for the Senate from New Hampshire.
I don't know. I think he'd be tough to beat. I'll tell you one thing, he'll go into Washington and he's going to have you in mind. He's going to do a job, if he does do it. So we'll see what happens. He hasn't made up his mind yet. But he would be, he would be fantastic and I guess it's something you go back and you talk to your family, you talk to your wife and you make a decision.
They're all saying, are you going to support him? I said, I don't know if he's running. So Corey, let us know please, if you don't mind. Let us know. Our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth and 100% pro-American. For decades and decades, the permanent politicians in Washington pursued the very opposite.
They sold out our workers, you see it, you know it better than any place. When I talk about the horrors of NAFTA, the horrors of trade deals, I mean I'm sorry to tell you this. I usually refer to New Hampshire. Nobody took it worse than New England and nobody took it worse than New Hampshire. Now, here's the good news.
I would never let that happen again and Chris will never let that happen again. Is there a doctor, please, doctor in the house? Thank you. Doctor in the house? Please, doctor, please. Thank you very much. Take your time. Take your time. Take your time fellas, plenty of time. You know people got here two and a half days ago, many of these people in the front, right?
Two and a half -- two and a half days ago, a lot of these people. So you can understand it's pretty tough. Thank you. That's OK. These are great people. He's a great people that love our country. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, pretty good, pretty good. So while politicians shift away our jobs, shed our sovereignty, surrendered our dignity and saddled our nation in one foreign debacle after another, and we're still here.
We're still here, you better believe taht and we're here stronger than ever before, we're here. But all of that ended the day that I took the oath of office. The American people are in charge of their country again. We've cut a record number of job killing regulations that were strangling our country. We cut more regulations in two and a half years than any other president in their full terms.
Four years, eight years or in one case more than that, cut more than anybody. To get relief to working families, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country. You're making a lot more money. You're making a lot more money and you see it and you know it because you see it in your paycheck every week.
We ended the last administration's coal war on American energy and we are delivering a policy of American energy independence like you've never seen before. And in fact, if you look at the straits where we're having all of the problems, you look at the straits, No. 1 they're not touching our ships. They're not playing with our ships.
They're taking them from this country, from that country, from that country. But you know what, very importantly, we have very few ships going there anymore because we don't need that oil and gas. And the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. Every leading Democrat has pledged to abolish the American oil, coal and natural gas industries that are fueling our economic boom.
Can you imagine this? We're sitting on great wealth, they want to take it away from us. And the alternatives don't have the power. They don't have. They want wind, wind, wind is so, so beautiful as long as you don't have to stare at a windmill, and your house goes down in value like they're nothing. Steve, if you had a windmill anywhere near your house, you would have gotten one-third the price you got Steve, that's true by the way.
Steve is too smart to let that happen. We won't let them take it away from you. We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that shattered New Hampshire and your factories. They shattered your communities and they shattered American power and American prestige all around the globe. New Hampshire lost one in four manufacturing jobs following NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.
Two of the worst deals ever in the history of our world, not just our country. Election after election, politicians came to your state, pretending to have the courage to stand up for the American worker. Then they went to Washington and let other countries push them around and special interests buy them off and steal your jobs and take your companies.
What happened? Me, I don't care about their campaign contributions. It doesn't matter to me folks. We want to do a job. We want to do a great job and we're setting records, and you know who's sending us the money, the small donors. Well, we have big donors, but we have small donors, are sending us the money for the election.
Pretty amazing, that's not supposed to happen to a Republican, but it's happening to this republic and it's happening to you. Every vow that politicians made was broken, every hope was dashed and every promise turned into a total betrayal of New Hampshire and of our country. But in this administration we have something those sell out politicians could only dream of it's called strength and commitment.
We don't play games. We don't play games. After years and years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country standing up for our jobs, our workers and standing up for our dignity. The forgotten men and women of America will never ever be forgotten again. You were forgotten. The last administration was Sleepy Joe and Obama tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated, worse than NAFTA, worst than WTO.
It was called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It would have been a disaster. TPP would have gutted the American auto industry. Would have been in shambles. Our auto industry is coming back so strong. It would have gutted, would have destroyed the industry. But in my first week in office, I proudly withdrew the United States from that job, destroying catastrophe.
And we're imposing beautiful, well-placed tariffs. Money comes in on foreign countries that cheat our workers, steal our jobs and break all the rules. I'm sorry. And by the way, they've been changing and charging tariffs on us for years. We have countries that charge us 100%, 200%, 297% in the case of Canada, with your farm products, we're not going to stand for it. And man, did we turn things around and we've just started.
If companies don't want to pay a tariff, I have one simple solution: come make your product in America, come make your product in New Hampshire, zero tolerance, zero, zero, zero. Together, we're restoring this nation's industrial might and we are doing it with American iron, American aluminum and American steel.
We're doing steel. Steel industry is hot. They were dumping steel all over. They were destroying our companies. U.S. steel now, all of them. They're all expanding. The steel industry is back. It's doing great. We're opening up mines in Minnesota, the great state of Minnesota. They have magnificent mines that have the best iron ore in the world and President Obama closed them down.
Maybe we can get representative Omar from Minnesota to open it up, but I don't think so. She'll open them up. I don't think so. Representative Omar, that's another one. We're replacing NAFTA with a brand new USMCA, that's Mexico and Canada. Great deal. The USMCA will create countless jobs for farmers, manufacturers all across the state.
We need Congress to pass the USMCA immediately. We'll make it a bipartisan deal. We don't even want credit. The union's benefit, the non-union's benefit, everybody benefits. It brings it back to fairness, and it makes it very hard for our companies to leave our countries go to Mexico or Canada. We lose all our jobs.
We lose all our taxes. We end up with empty factories and plants. It makes it almost impossible. We're not going to have that. That was my one rule that I had to have. It's gonna be very very hard for companies to do that. I've also taken the toughest-ever action to stand up to China's chronic trade abuses.
Earlier this month, the U.S. government officially labeled China for the first time ever, a currency manipulator. Another promise kept. While others allowed China to freely loot the U.S. economy, $500 billion a year, not millions, not million, billion, with a B. We've made it clear that the theft of American jobs and American wealth is over.
Yet, today the Wall Street Journal editorial board and some others continue to publish foolish articles that demonstrate that they understand nothing about trade or business, nothing. They advocate only economic surrender. They actually say, go to China, take off the tariffs, make a deal. I lose all the cards if we take off the tariffs.
You know how many cards? Think of it. They say, go to Europe, by the way, the European Union is worse than China, just smaller. It treats us horribly, barriers, tariffs, taxes and we let them come in. It's worse than China, many of us come from there. That's what it's got going. That's about it. They treat us really badly and many others, many many others.
India, tariffs us probably higher than any nation anywhere in the world. We have tariffs of 100% on products and much more than that. India, so we're working on all of them. I called Prime Minister Modi. I said, Mr. Prime Minister, not fair. We gonna change. We gonna change. We gonna change, gonna change.
And we're talking to them very seriously. We're talking to a lot of places, but when the Wall Street Journal comes out and they say, no, no, take the tariffs off, go and talk to -- they've been trying to talk to them for 25 years, but actually you know what, they really haven't. The fact is, the leaders that were in my position, they didn't do a damn thing.
They didn't talk. They didn't talk. Past leaders followed the terrible advice of these editorial boards that are, frankly, totally inexperienced in business, I guess, and our industries were utterly decimated. Globalism enriches foreign countries at our expense, globalism. I love our country. I'm the president of the United States of America.
I'm not the president of the world. And as long as I'm president, America will never bow to a foreign nation like we were for so many years. As we restore our prosperity, we are also restoring public safety. We are fighting to reduce violent crime. You see so much it over the last 25 years, so much crime.
And ensure that every American can live in safety and peace. And yet, with all that you see, we've had one of the best years of crime prevention that we've ever had. Wouldn't seem that way, but it is one of the best years, because those gentlemen that we just saw, law enforcement, they do a great job. And you've been reading about this a lot lately.
We are working very hard to make sure we keep guns out of the hands of insane people and those who are mentally sick and shouldn't have guns. But people have to remember, however, that there is a mental illness problem that has to be dealt with. It's not the gun that pulls the trigger. It's the person holding the gun.
Years ago, many cities and states, I remember so well closed mental institutions for budgetary reasons. They let those people out onto the street. You probably have your examples up here. I can tell you in New York, they closed so many of them and they let really seriously mentally ill people out on the streets, and you see plenty of them today.
Even today, we're going to have to give major consideration to building new facilities for those in need. We have to do it. And at the same time, we will be taking mentally deranged and dangerous people off of the streets so we won't have to worry so much about that. It's a big problem. We don't have those institutions anymore and people can't get proper care.
They're seriously ill people and they're on the streets. We can't make it harder for good, solid law-abiding citizens to protect themselves. We will always uphold the right to self-defense and we will always uphold the Second Amendment. We will. So important. One of the most powerful promises I made to the people of this state was to confront the opioid and drug epidemic.
I used to go around New Hampshire more than any state and you'd say, sir, the state is infested. You said, sir, we're like a drug den. You tell me, and I didn't really see it, and then I met with the police officers and fire departments and all the people that do, and you just seem to have a bigger problem -- and by the way, the wall is being built.
That's going to stop a lot of it. Wall is being built. You know we have the fake news, you know about that, were they -- a wall that's lying on the ground in a very important section, so we pick up the wall, bits and pieces. I mean, literally, it's gone and we build a brand new 30-foot steel and concrete wall and the fake media said, he didn't build the wall.
That's just renovation. There was no wall. It's lying on the ground. People walk right over it. It's rotted rusted gone. We take it away, we put a brand new wall up, they give me no credit. You know why? Because they're fake news, that's why. We're building a lot of wall. The Army Corps of Engineers is doing a great job.
They're doing a great job. Since I took office, we've attacked the challenge with everything we have. We have secured a record $6 billion in new funding opioid. We vastly increase the distribution of overdose, reversing drugs, which are pretty amazing things. We've given them to your police department, your fire department, pretty amazing.
We have reduced the total amount of opioids prescribed by 34% and the Department of Justice has prosecuted more than 3,000 defendants in opioids-related cases and our public awareness campaign about the terrible suffering that drugs inflict has already reached 58% of all young Americans. I said that you have to show them we're doing ads, beautiful ads in shows and you've seen them.
I don't even want to describe them. They're brutal. But we're doing ads on television and papers about how bad it is for children. So they can see it because the greatest thing we could do is not get people started on drugs, right? Not get them started. It's hard to get off. You know we can get them off and we're doing it and it's been done, but it's hard to get off.
If they never start, it's real easy. It's real easy. So we're trying to get young kids. You won't see the fruits of this labor for a little while because it takes a while, but we're really -- we are working so hard on advertising and promotions to tell young kids, children how bad drugs are, how dangerous they are, how horrible they are, how they destroy your brain, how they do so many bad things.
And they're really very tough ads they're hard hitting ads, and I think they're having a big impact. You'll see. Over time, you'll see. But we still have much work to do. But as a result of these efforts, last year, we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in 31 years. It's pretty amazing.
And at the center of America's drug crisis is the border crisis. Vast quantities of deadly narcotics are being smuggled across the border, including meth, cocaine, heroin and fentanyl. And as part of my trade deal with China, it's been very important and President Xi said he's going to do it. So far, he has not done it. But I said, you have to stop sending us fentanyl, you have to. And you have to criminalize in China the making of fentanyl and so far, he has not come through, but I think he will.
You'll know. You'll know. Yet Democrats want to open borders and Republicans want strong borders. That's the difference. One wants open borders. Who can even think of an open border? Think of it. Even though many people that come into our country are wonderful people, they're still coming in illegally. They're not coming in through merit, but what about the bad ones?
We have serious, serious criminals that want to come in. And if we had open borders, they would be flowing in like you've never seen before. Democrats want open borders, they don't mind crime, we do mind crime and that's the way it is. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities. Last year alone, sanctuary cities declined more than 17,000 requests from federal authorities to hand over criminal aliens already in their custody.
In other words, 17,000 criminal aliens were released by these cities directly into U.S. communities. You don't understand even what the hell are they doing? What are they doing? 17,000. Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. And we will always support the amazing heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and we will always support law enforcement.
Every Democrat candidate also wants to give illegal immigrants free welfare. Republicans believe public benefit should be protected for truly needy Americans, not for illegal aliens, and we should reduce our taxes and many other things with all of that money that we're talking about. We need to elect a strong Republican majority to end sanctuary cities, stop human traffickers, stop drug smugglers and adopt an immigration system that puts the needs of American workers and families first.
It's also time for Democrats to join with us to protect the sacred integrity of our elections by supporting voter ID, voter identification. It's incredible. They constantly saying, oh, we need to protect them. But they're not looking for that. They're not looking for that. We say, what about voter ID? In other words, you have a picture.
You have to go up. What about voter ID? That they don't want to do. But we need voter ID. The Democrat Party has never been farther outside the mainstream. Where do they come from? You know, you say you want low taxes, good education, strong military, strong borders, you want to have safe homes, you want a house, you want low interest rates, you got low -- hey, you got low interest rates, the lowest ever.
Got lowered rates. Good time to refinance your house, by the way, great time. You got everything and then you see these people they're against. They have no idea what they're doing. They have no idea what they're against. Every major Democrat running for President supports a massive government takeover of health care that would raid Medicare and destroy the private health insurance plans of millions of American families that they love.
My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. The individual mandate is gone, the most unpopular part of Obamacare, and we almost have Obamacare gone. We're close. We would have had it before, but we had a vote that was a little bit surprising. I'm sure none of you knew who that vote was.
We had it done, repeal and replace. But it's got to happen and I think it's going to actually be in the end, actually better. You watch. So we got rid of the individual mandate, which was the most unpopular part of Obamacare and we're running it better. You know I had a political decision, do I make it great?
Alex Cesar, our secretary, do we run it well? And sort of say, hey, we run it well or do we run it badly and have everybody upset? We said, we got to run it well, but it's still much too expensive. It's lousy health care, but we got rid of the worst part of it, individual mandate, individual mandate, where you have the privilege of buying the right not to have to pay for expensive insurance.
That's no good health insurance. And we will -- and you've got to remember this, Republicans and I speak for every one of them. We will always protect pre-existing conditions. We're going to protect, always. Right? Got to do it. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in 51 years and the only decline in 51 years.
We have launched a historic initiative to require price transparency, empowering you to choose the lowest price for yourself and for your family, believe it or not. You didn't have the right to go in and price your drugs. Who could even believe this? I wonder if big pharma had something to do with that. So we're gonna have transparency.
Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth. And in the case of the Virginia governor, he's having a rough, rough time. In his case, the baby is born and then he goes to talk to the mother. The doctor talks to the mother.
The baby is now born, wrapped, as he said, and then they decide whether or not to execute the baby. That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God. Hard to believe, isn't it? The democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion and socialism.
The Republican Party is the party of freedom. We are the party of the American worker, the American family and the American dream, and I'm fighting for you each and every day. So importantly, we have confirmed more than 140 federal judges. Within 90 days, it will be 179 federal judges. Thank you very much, President Obama.
Thank you very much. I don't know what happened to them, but I came to office and I had 138 judges that were not appointed by President Obama. So I say thank you, Mr. President, very good and they'll say, he was a great president. Oh really, the fake news. He was a great President. If he was a great President, how come he left to me a 138 judges to appoint when everybody says that's the single most important thing a President of the United States has to do. Great President.
He was great. He was a great president. And these judges will apply the law as written, including we appointed 2 great Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. And to help patients with life threatening illnesses, we also passed something I'm so proud of. 44 years, they couldn't get it passed, right to try.
You can use our newest, our best medicines. Incredible of what's happening, I'm so proud of that. And this from forever, 5 decades, we passed for our great veterans, VA choice and VA accountability. And one of our great friends was a veteran who's been with me in New Hampshire. I don't know where you are.
Where is our guy? Where is he? So well -- so I walk in, I said, he's been with me from the beginning. He was there whether -- he liked Trump and I came in. He said, sir -- he's a great veteran. He said, sir, I have cancer and sir, I went into the vet, they were very, very late. They had problems. I'm not blaming them, but they gave me the right to go out and get a great cancer surgeon.
He had his operation. You look much better than you did three years ago, Al. Much better, much better. VA Choice right, Al? VA Choice. Great story. Thank you very much and thank you for your loyalty. You've been -- he's been to every rally I ever gave in New Hampshire right from the beginning. I got so tired of looking at him.
He'd always be here. Now he's -- look at him, now he's sitting in very good, that's good, but I appreciate that story. I appreciate. VA choice just make sense, right? Doesn't it make sense? We've achieved record funding for the United States military, $716 billion, $700 billion and $738 billion and it's almost completely rebuilt, including and we hope to God we never have to use it, we have the finest most powerful nuclear capability anywhere on the face of the earth and I hope to God we never have to use it. We're investing in the future of human spaceflight and someday soon, American astronauts will plant the stars and stripes on the surface of Mars.
And I told my guys at NASA, you know NASA when we took it over, it was exhausted. The runways and the grounds that are all weeds growing through the cracks in the concrete. You wouldn't recognize it now, it's beautiful, it's the best place anywhere on earth. And I also said that you know, I hear all these rich guys for some reason they love space.
So they're rich. I said, let them send the rockets up. Why the hell do we have to do it, right? So I see Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, they're putting rockets up, I think it's great and they pay us rent. They use our facility. That's great. But we're also doing it and NASA has some of the greatest plans we've ever had.
These are great people, great scientists, but we also let the private sector put up rockets, the one which recently went up and you see the engines coming back down and they're come -- there's no wings, no nothing. It's almost like what are we watching? Is this fiction? And they come down and they save all of the propellants.
All of the -- really the most expensive parts, they're able to save it by bringing it back right to where it took off. Who would think they could do this? I never saw this before six months ago, but they're doing it now more and more. They're saving a lot of the most important and expensive parts of rockets.
So we have a lot of rich guys paying us a lot of rent, but we're also doing it ourselves to protect America's security. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just three months ago, we also recognized the Golan Heights as being a part of and protected by Israel.
For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of New Hampshire. Thank you. And you must never forget the 2020 election right around the corner. 2020 right around the corner, and it's about one thing.
You know what the one thing is? You. It's about you. It's about your family, it's about your future and it's about the fate of your country. So when we ran together last time, we said, the most important ally we had to turn it around. This country was going bad, you see what happened to Venezuela with socialism?
Venezuela 15 years ago, was one of the richest countries. Now they don't have water, they don't have food, they don't have anything and this was one of the richest nations in the world. They don't have anything. We're working on it. We're helping people. But it's very sad, it's never going to happen to us because we will never ever be a socialist nation ever.
No matter what label they use. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction, the destruction of the American dream. We have a dream. It's a great dream. This is the destruction of the American dream. We begin this campaign tonight with the best record, the best results, the best agenda and the only positive vision for the people of New Hampshire and for the people of America.
Together, we will lift millions more citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity, millions and millions of people. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that are already happening, that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA.
We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, ending the AIDS epidemic in America and finding new cures for childhood cancer. And something I never thought I'd be able to say within 1 decade, the AIDS epidemic in the United States will be gone. Think of that. Did you ever think you're going to hear that?
No, did you ever think you're going to hear that? The work they've done on AIDS is incredible. That's an incredible thing. When they told me that, I said, it's just shattering -- it just -- it breaks your heart of what's happened but think of it. In ten years, the AIDS epidemic will be eradicated. So great.
Who thought that was going to be happening? Who thought I'd be able to get to say that so early in what we're doing together. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States.
We will stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history and to always respect our great American flag.
And through every day and every challenge, our hearts speak to the words of the New Hampshire state motto: live free or die. We are fighting for every American mom and dad who wants to protect this land of liberty for their precious, beautiful children. We are fighting for every young boy and girl who deserves to grow up in a nation of builders and dreamers, pioneers and patriots.
And we are fighting for every citizen of the greatest republic on the face of this earth. Everyday in my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us, the brave, this beautiful, strong, proud and free future. It belongs to us. It's up to us. We control our own destiny.
And with your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one great movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together, we are making America wealthy again, we are making America strong again, we are making America safe again and we are making America great again. Thank you New Hampshire. Thank you.
Thank you. Let us pray. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed is your name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Good afternoon. It is my honor and great pleasure to stand here before you as the First Lady of the United States. The mid the America we envision is one that works for all Americans, and where all Americans can work and succeed. A nation committed to a greater civility and unity between people from all sides of the political divide. I will always stay true to myself and be truthful to you, no matter what the opposition is saying about me.
I will act in the best interest of all of you. I am committed to creating and supporting initiatives geared to my heart, which will have impacts on women and children all around the world.
My husband is creating a country of great safety and prosperity. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to introduce the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
Thank you, everybody, thank you. I didn't know that Melania was going to be saying the Lord's Prayer, but I thought that was very beautiful, thank you, thank you.
It's so great to be here in Florida. My second home with you. This is a state I truly love. This is a state where we all had great victory together. Thank you.
It's now been a month since my inauguration. And I am here to tell you about our incredible progress in making America great again. I'm also here to tell you about our plans for the future and they're big and they're bold and It's what our country is all about, believe me.
I'm here because I want to be among my friends and among the people. This was a great movement, a movement like has never been seen before in our country our probably anywhere else. This was a truly great movement And I want to be here with you, and I will always be with you. I promise you that. I want to be in a room filled with hard working American patriots who love their country, who salute their flag and who pray for a better future.
I also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news. The dishonest media which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them, they make them up in many cases, they just don't want to report the truth and they've been calling us wrong now for two years. They don't get it. By they're starting to get it. I can tell you that. They've become a big part of the problem. They are part of the corrupt system. Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out often times on their lies. When the media lies to people, I will never, ever let them get away with it. I will do whatever I can that. They don't get away with it.
They have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda. In fact, Thomas Jefferson said, nothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Trth itself, he said, becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle, that was June 14, my birthday, 1807. But despite all their lies, misrepresentations, and false stories, they could not defeat us in the primaries, and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are, and most importantly, we will continue to win, win, win.
We are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe. We are free and independent people and we will make our own choices.
We are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I hear your demands, I hear your voices and I promise you I will deliver. I promise that. And by the way, you've seen what we've accomplished in a very short period of time. The White House is running so smoothly. So smoothly. And believe me, I and we inherited one big mess. That I can tell you, but I know that you want safe neighborhoods where the streets belong to families and communities, not gang members and drug dealers who are right now as I speak being thrown out of the country and they will not be let back in.
We will have strong borders again, and I mean that. You've seen it in television. You've seen it on television. General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he's really doing the job. You're seeing it. The gang members, bad, bad people. I said day one, and they're going out. Or they're being put in prison, but for the most part, get them the hell out of here. Bring them back to where they came from.
The fact is, you want great schools for your children. You want good high paying jobs for yourselves and for your loved ones and for the future of your families. You want a health care system and by the way, we are going to be submitting in a couple of weeks a great healthcare plan that's going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare.
It will be repealed and replaced. For those people. The people put into rooms where Republicans are talking about the plan, and it wouldn't matter what they say, for those people just so you understand, our plan will be much better health care at a much lower coast. Okay? Nothing to complain about. Obamacare remember, it is a disaster.
You want low cost American energy also, which means lifting the restrictions on oil, on shell, on natural gas and on clean, very clean coal. We're going to put the miners back to work. The miners go back to work.
You want us to enforce immigration laws and defend our borders.
You want fair trade deals and a level playing field. We don't have a level playing field. Because you understand that when American workers win, America as a country wins and wins big. And every country over the last long period of time has been taking advantage of the [inaudible] of our politicians. It's not going to happen any longer.
You want lower taxes. Less regulation. Millions of new jobs and more product stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, Made in the USA. You want to make it easy for companies to do business in America. And harder for companies to leave. We don't want companies saying, everybody is fired. We're moving to another country. We're going to make the product. Sell it across the border and isn't that wonderful. Not going happen anymore.
We're going to have strong borders and when they want to sell that product back across our border, they're going to pay a 35% tax and you know what, they're never going to leave. They will never, ever leave.
And you've seen that because I've already displayed it for the last two months even before I got into office. They're not leaving. And if they do, they're going to pay a big price for terminating the relationship with our workers. You want a government that serves the people not the donors and special interest. You want a government that keeps its promises.
A great spirit of optimism is sweeping and you see it. it's sweeping all across the country. Look at what's happening to the stock market. Look at what's happening to the every poll when it comes to optimism in our country. It's sweeping across the country. And, in fact, every day for the last long period of days this stock market means, companies, have been hitting new highs. They're going to start highs. It's going to be a new day in America. You're going to be proud again.
Jobs are already starting to pour back in. They're coming back in like you haven't seen in a long time. Ford, General Motors, Fiat, Chrysler are bringing in and bringing back thousands of jobs investing billions of dollars because of the new business climate that we are creating in our country. In Arizona, Intel, great company, just announced it will open a new plant that will create at least 10,000 brand new beautiful American jobs.
I followed through on my promise to withdraw from the job killing disaster known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPP, we have just terminated our relationship to it. We're going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be bilateral or as we would say, one-on-one. None of these deals where we get caught in quicksand. Get mired in and we can't do anything about it. By the way, NAFTA and so many others.
My administration has begun plans to crack down on foreign cheating and currency manipulation which is killing our companies and really, really hurting our workers. We're going to end it.
Within a few days of taking the oath of office, I've taken steps to begin the construction of the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipelines. Anywhere from 30-40,000 jobs. And very importantly, as I was about to sign it, I said who makes the pipe? Who makes the pipe? Something this audience understands very well, right? Simple question. The lawyers put this very complex document in front. I said, who makes the pipe? They said, sir, it can be made anywhere. I said not anymore. I put a little clause in the bottom. The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we're going to have pine line.
We believe in two simple rules. I can tell you everybody in this massive, this is a massive hanger. For the big planes. And by the way, do you think that one media group back there, one network will show this crowd. Not one. Not one. They won't show the crowd. You know, coming in on the plane, and that plane represented so much.
And just so you know, they were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One. Can you believe this? I said no way. I said I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane. I refuse. So I got Boeing and it is actually  a lot of people don't know. The Air Force One project is actually two planes. Why they need to planes, we'll have to talk about that, but they have two planes, but we've got that price down over a billion dollars and I probably have it spoken to be honest with you for honest probably an more than an hour on the project. I got the generals in who are fantastic. I got Boeing in. I told Boeing it's not good enough. We're still not going to do it. The price is still too high. On the fighter jet. We were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. Seven years late, great plane. A great plane.
So think of it. They're seven years late. Hundreds of billions of dollars over-budget. Other than that by the way the project is going extremely well. And I got the folks in from Lockheed Martin who are terrific people and a terrific product by the way. I also got Boeing in. I said do me a favor, give me a competing offer. And now they're competing and fighting and we've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars off the price of a plane that was going to be ordered, in other words, if my opponent got in, there would have been no calls made to them. They would have signed contracts. So they're going to make plenty of money, but it's going to be a lot less than they would have made without Trump. That I can tell you. You might as well know about it. Nobody talks. By the way, that's for fighter jets. One of the biggest orders in the history of aviation. The order for the F-35. You've been reading about it because it was a disaster. Under the last administration. A disaster. And now we have it running beautifully.
In fact, when the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Abe, was great. Great guy. When he came over, he said, thank you. I said for what. You saved us many, many millions of dollars on the F-35 fighter jet. Because when I negotiated, I took our allies into the same negotiation. So the first thing he did was thanked med for saving them money and that's good. Okay. That's good. I know the media will never thank me so at least Japan is thanking me, right?
But we believe in two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. We believe it. We've just issued a new order which requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. And by the way, a new director was just approved. Can you imagine the length of time it's taken to Democrats and I actually think it's an embarrassment to them, but this is getting in to be record setting time. Incredible people.
Scott Pruitt was just approved, just now approved for the Environmental Protection Agency. He'll do so good. He won't have projects going ten and 12 years and getting rejected. They may be rejected, but they'll be rejected quickly. For the most part, they're going to be accepted. They're going to be environmentally friendly and he is going to be a great Secretary. He will be amazing. We're very happy. That took place yesterday. That's going to be a big difference because they were clogging up the veins of our country with the environmental impact statements and all of the rules and regulations. It was impossible to navigate for companies.
And what did it really mean? Forget about the companies? What did it mean. It meant no jobs. It meant companies leaving our country and going to foreign countries to do things they would rather do here. So we're going to have a whole big situation. We are going to unfreeze all of those companies. They are going to be  they're going have freedom. Be able to build what they want to build. It will be environmentally friendly and we're going to start producing jobs like you've never seen before. That's going to happen. That was a big thing.
We're standing up for the incredible men and women always of law enforcement. We're standing up. And I can tell you, the military and law enforcement they stood up. I don't say for me. I'm the messenger folks. I'm the messenger. They stood up for us in this last election. We got numbers that nobody believed were possible from law enforcement and from military. Basically people they wear uniforms like us. Isn't that nice. I saw this man on TV just now, you. I just saw him on television. He said I love Trump. Let Trump do what he has to do. That's my guy right there. Come here. Come here. No, I just. I'm coming in. That's okay.
Let him up. I'm not worried about him. I'm only worried he's going to give me a kiss. I'm not worried about anything else. This guy is so great. He was one of many people. They're interviewing people in the line. And I have to say, there was a tiny group of protesters out there and they were given as much publicity as this massive room packed with people, but they interviewed this man. Come on up here. Come on up. Guy was great. Hop over the fence. Come on. He can do it. He's in good shape. Look at him. Look at this guy. Come on. This guy is great. Don't worry about him. No, no. Come here. They're going to  come on up. Come here.
This guy. So he's been all over television saying the best things and I see him standing and didn't you get here at like 4 in the morning.
I did sir.
Say a couple of words to this crowd.
Mr. President, thank you sir. We the people, our movement is the reason why our President of the United States is standing here in front of us today. When President Trump during the election promised all these things that he was going to do for us, I knew he was going to do this for us. Thank you so much, sir.
A star is born.
A star is born. That's fine.
I wouldn't say that Secret Service was thrilled with that, but we know our people, right? We know our people. Great guy. And so many others. I see some others. Being interviewed. I see them over here. They started. They came at 4 in the morning. The media will give them no credit. The media, as I told you, won't show this crowd.
All the way outside of this  this is a big a hanger as you get. All the way outside. Way back to the fences. Amazing. I want to thank you, but I want to thank everybody.
I've directed the Department of Justice to take a firm, firm stance to protect our cops, sheriffs, and police from crimes of violence against them. We will work with our police not against our police, our police do a great job and they've never been troubled like they're troubled now. It's very unfair what's happening. So we want to cherish our law enforcement. We will always protect those who protect us.
We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including our inner cities. We're going to make our inner cities safe again. Look at what's going on. Look at what's happening in Chicago. Hundreds of shootings, hundreds of deaths. I'll tell you what's happening in Chicago and many other places. Safety is a civil right. And we will fight to make America totally safe again.
I've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy transnational criminal cartels which are all over the United States and we are going to stop the drugs from pours into your country, into your community, into your cities and poisoning our youth. We're stopping it. We're stopping it. We've taken historic action to secure the southern border and I've ordered the construction of a great border wall, which will start very shortly.
And I've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. So you probably read where we want to enforce the laws as existing. And so we signed an order a couple of weeks ago, and it was taken over by a court originally by a judge and then a  yes, it's very sad. The reason is for protection and safety. So the statute is so plain and so clear.
I said last week, I was speaking to a great group of sheriffs, the sheriffs group in Washington, and I said if you have a college education, you can understand its. If you have a high school education, you can understand it. If you were a bad student in high school, you can understand it.
I was told. I'll check, but I found it hard to believe, over 30-page decision by the appellate court. Three judges. And you could tell by the way they were reacting because it was broadcast on television. Everything we do gets a lot of people watching. So you could tell by the way that phone call went, wasn't looking good. When they wrote their decision, as I understand it. Maybe I'm wrong.
They didn't write the statute they were making the decision about because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side. So I thought I would read it. And here's what it says. This is what it says: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States  okay. So essentially. Whenever somebody comes into the United States. Right.
If it would be detrimental to the interest of the United States  okay. Now you know the country's we're talking about and these were countries picked by Obama. They weren't even picked. They were picked by Obama.
He may, so the President may, by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary  now, because it should have said he or she, right. They were not politically correct when they drew this. In fact, that's the only thing that was actually wrong with it. He or she. I don't think the women care too much about that. Right? I don't think so. By the way, we did very well with women. You know, my wife said when some of these phony polls were put out, the CNN poll was so far off, the phony polls. When some of these, she said, what's wrong with you and women. We did very nicely with women. We did nicely with a lot of groups they didn't think we were going to do so nicely with. I guess we had to. That's why we're all here tonight. Right?
So and it goes, for such as he shall seem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate. So basically it says the president has the right to keep people out if he feels it's not in the best interest of our country. Right? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And I listened to these judges talk and talk and talk. So unfair. So we'll be doing something over the next couple of days. We don't give up. We never give up.
We had a court that I disagree with. I disagree with big league  and by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television when other lawyers come on, many of them can't even understand. They're saying how do you come up with that decision. It cannot be more simple. So they're ruling on what I just read you and they don't even quote it in their ruling because you can't because it's too obvious. So we will do something next week. I think you'll be impressed. Let's see what happens.
Here's the bottom line. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris. We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we're going to keep our country safe.
And we all have heart, by the way. And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country, that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else  folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn't believe, but we're going to build safe zones. We're going to have those safe zones.
We do owe $20 trillion. Okay. So we're going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones. They've got nothing, but money. We're going to do it that way instead of taking massive numbers. Tens the of thousands of people into our country and we don't know anything about those people. We want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us. We want people that can cherish us and the traditions of our country. We want people that are going to be great for our country. We don't want people with bad, bad ideas. We don't want that.
I've also directed the defense community headed by General, now  you know, he said it, he said it  and now Secretary Mad Dog Mattis, to develop a plan to totally destroy ISIS. I have ordered the department of defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the united states military. We will pursue peace through strength. Our military is badly depleted. You have planes in the military. Where the father flew them and now the son is flying them. Their so old. We make the best equipment anywhere in the world. We're going to start using our best and most modern equipment.
And we're going to make sure our veterans have the care they need when they come home. We love our veterans. We're going to do a great job for our veterans. Our veterans have been very, very sadly treated. These are our great great people. We owe them so much. Our veterans are going to be taken care of for once and for all. Our system and our country has led down our veterans. We are not going to let that go on any further. You wait and you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans. Thank you veterans. Who is here? Who is a veteran? We're going to take care of our veterans.
We're going to downsize the bloated, bloated bureaucracy which make the government lien and accountable. We're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. I've already imposed a five year lobbying ban on the executive branch officials and lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.
And there's another major promise I have kept to the American people. I've nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late great Justice Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He comes from my list of 20 very, very highly qualified judges. He's incredible and has an incredible resume. He's respected by all. His education is as good as it can get. His writings are truly amazing. He will be a true, true defender of our constitution. So let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country because what's happening with the Democrats  no wonder they're doing so badly.
No wonder they're doing so badly. You take a look, race after race, I just want the tell you, in case you didn't read it, of course you're reading the fake news, but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency. That didn't happen. They were supposed to take over the Senate. That didn't happen. And they were supposed to take over potentially even the House. It was going to be four weeks out the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics. And it was, but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans. So we have to tell the Democrats, because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people, to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction. They got to get on with it.
My administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform. We are working to lower tax rates in the middle class to reduce tax rates big league on businesses and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans so it's understandable by everyone. Senate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs, but the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially. We're not going let that happen.
Also time for the Senate Democrats to take responsibility for Obamacare and to work with us to replace it with new reforms that reverse this nation-wide healthcare tragedy. It's a tragedy. You look at some states, Arizona, up 116%. Your deductibles have gone so high you can never use it. Obamacare doesn't work. It's become totally unaffordable. Remember they said the healthcare, it's unaffordable. It doesn't work. And I said to the Republicans, I said you want to do something great politically: don't do anything. Sit back for two years, let it explode. The Democrats will come and beg for us to do something, but we can't do that to the American people. We have to fix it. And we will.
We need members of both parties to join hands and work with us to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build new roads and bridges and airports and tunnels and highways and railways all across our great nation.
You're all part of this incredible movement. This movement that we talk about so much. That's been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world. It's a movement that is just sweeping. It's sweeping across our country. It's sweeping frankly across the globe. Look at Brexit. Look at Brexit. Much smaller example, but it's still something you can look at. People want to take back control of their countries and they want to take back control of their lives and the lives of their family.
The nation state remains the best model for human happiness and the American nation remains the greatest symbol of liberty, of freedom and justice on the face of god's earth. And now we have spirit like we've never had before. It's now that we have our sacred duty and we have no choice and we want this choice to defend our country, to protect its values and to serve its great, great citizens. Erasing national borders does not make people safer. It undermines democracy and trade prosperity. We're giving it away.
The so-called global elite have done well for themselves, but left working families with shrinking wages. Really they are shrinking. 18 years ago though many of you in this room made more money working one job than you're making right now working two and three jobs. Instead of peace, we've seen wars that never end and conflicts that never seem to go away. We don't fight to win. We fight politically correct wars. We don't win anymore. We don't win at trade. We don't win in any capacity. We don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again. Believe me.
And we have the chance now working together to deliver change for the ages. This will be change for the ages. Change like never before. To pursue real peace, real stability, and real prosperity. We want to secure our borders and protect our workers. To rebuild our military and our infrastructure. To fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods. To bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities. To ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce. To reform our tax code and remove the regulations that undermine growth and innovation. And to replace chaos and distrust with community and cooperation. The tired echoes of yesterday's fights. We're fighting battles that no longer help us. We're fighting battles that other people aren't treating us fairly in the fight.
I'm a NATO fan, but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries. They're not paying their bills. They're not paying their bills. They have to help us. No longer are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past. No longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about, but failure. New circumstances demand new solutions. Americans have fought and won wars together. Our heroes have shed their blood together and lost their lives. Our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next. Stretching back to the first day of our American independence. This is our legacy. It belongs to all of you. And it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation.
Now is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold acts. Let us move past the differences party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country. We are all brothers and all sisters. We share one home. One destiny and one glorious American flag. We are united together by history and by providence. We will make America strong again. I promise. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Greater than ever before.
May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Hello, Arizona. We love being in Arizona. We've been here all day and all night. It is great to be in the great state of Arizona, with thousands of hard-working and beautiful American patriots. Thank you very much. In just 18 days, the people of Arizona are going to send Martha McSally, a great woman -- I will tell you, I know her well -- she's a great woman -- to the United States Senate to protect your jobs, defend your borders, and continue making America great again.
And, remember, early voting in Arizona is underway right now. So if anybody would like to leave and go out and vote, I don't mind at all. [Laughter] I see all those beautiful red hats and some white ones, right? And some white ones. The white ones are very nice. They're getting swamped by the red. Make America great again, you know that.
But what's the new name? Right? What's the new -- go ahead. In about -- what do you think, another 12 months, we could almost do it sooner, right? What does it say? Keep America great. Keep America great. Right? Keep America great. We got to get used to that, because there's something about that make America great again.
It's just worked. But keep America great is very important, because it's true, because everything we do they can destroy very quickly if the wrong people get into office. And this is an incredible time for our nation. The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years. More Americans are working today than at any point in the history of our country.
Think of it. It's a big number. That's a big stat. Think of that. Today, more Americans -- think of that -- more Americans are working than ever in the history of our country, today, right now. Nice. Nice. And here in Arizona, manufacturing jobs are surging at the fastest rate in more than two decades. Remember you weren't going to have any manufacturing jobs anymore, right?
I said, you mean we're not going to make things anymore? Six hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs. We're taking care of our veterans. And our military. We'll soon be more powerful than it has ever been before. Under Republican leadership, America is booming. America is thriving. And America is winning, because we are finally putting America first.
Just last week, we achieved another historic victory for the American people. In a beautiful ceremony at the White House, we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. They treated him badly. They treated him badly. What the radical Democrats did to Justice Kavanaugh and his wonderful family... is a national disgrace.
And don't forget it on November 6th. Don't forget it. Don't forget it. The Democrats have become an angry, unhinged mob determined to get power by any means necessary. Your vote in this election will decide which party controls Congress. And I will tell you, they're all talking about Arizona. And they're talking about Martha McSally.
They're all talking about Arizona. The choice for every American could not be more clear than it is right now. Democrats produce mobs. Republicans produce jobs. [Audience Chants USA] So this November, when you're voting, vote for the jobs, not for the mobs. Just do it. Just do it. You know, it's all very fragile.
It can end very quickly. Even Supreme Court, we picked two, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch. Two. Many presidents never pick any. They never get that great opportunity. They say it's the most important decision you can make. I would say war and peace is the most, but I would say it's second. But it's a great honor to have picked two great people.
And you know what? We can pick others before it's over and before even the first term, although we'll have eight years instead of four years, based on everything I see. Based on the competition that we see, you know, we can no longer say Pocahontas, because she has no Indian blood. We can no longer call her Pocahontas.
I don't know what I'm going to do. We'll have to come up with another name for her. Elizabeth Warren, a very boring name, we're going to have to come up with another name. I can't use the word Pocahontas anymore. [Laughter] There's no Indian blood! I always said, I have more Indian blood than she has and I have none.
I have none. That is more than true. I don't know. We'll have to come up with another name. If Nancy Pelosi... or cryin' Chuck Schumer and the radical Democrats take control of Congress on November 6th, they will try to plunge our country into a nightmare of gridlock, poverty, and chaos. You know that.
It's going to be a mess. Democrats want to raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country, turn us into a Venezuela... Turn us into another Venezuela, take away your health care, destroy your Second Amendment, and Democrats want to throw your borders wide open to deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. Come on in, everybody.
Come on in. Come on in, everybody. We are. The wall is under construction. We're building the wall, $1.6 billion, another $1.6 billion, another $1.6 billion. I want to build it all at one time. We can do it in one year. And you see what's happening. Right now, as you know, Mexico is on their southern border.
Their southern border. And they're fighting, and they're fighting some bad people in that group. You know, you see the people come up, and you listen to the fake news back there, and you think they're all... You think they're all wonderful people. Right? No, no, you think -- I'm serious. You think they're all wonderful people.
You got some bad people in those groups. You got some tough people in those groups. And I'll tell you what, this country doesn't want them. OK? We don't want them. Democrats have become the party of crime. It will be the election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, tax cuts. We forget about tax cuts all the time.
And common sense. But we forget about tax cuts. We gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. And I tell friends of mine that are running for office, we've got to stop bringing up tax cuts. It's almost like, eh -- we just did it. And we also got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, where you have the privilege of paying a fortune for having a second privilege of getting bad health care also for a fortune.
No, that's no good. We got rid of the individual mandate. You know another thing we did for -- I like a lot of people in Arizona, small businesses, farmers. You don't have estate tax. No more estate tax. So if you love your children -- which is a question -- you may not like 'em, in which case don't listen to me -- if you don't like 'em, don't leave them the farm.
But if you love 'em, you'll love Trump, because you don't have to pay estate tax, OK? That's a big thing. There are so many things, we don't have time to talk about 'em. We've got a lot for you. The -- I love you, too. Thank you. Thank you. I love you, too. The Democrat Party has become too extreme and too dangerous to be trusted with power.
If you want to drain the swamp, you must defeat the Democrats. You have to do it. So voting has already begun in Arizona. Many of you already have your ballots, return them today, return them tomorrow. Go ahead. Get them in. Vote early. It's already. But you have to vote on November 6th. And, by the way, the early voting shows that Martha is pretty much ahead.
We're way ahead of where we're [Inaudible] Don't get complacent. Remember this. For whatever reason, the party that wins the presidency almost always loses in the midterm. I don't know what that's all about. No, they get complacent. Not here, right? So here's the difference we have. We probably have the greatest economy in the history of our country.
That's right, so why would you -- why would we lose? And just don't be complacent, OK? Don't be. And then what happens, you go on -- and what happens often -- so they lose the midterm and then they go on to crush in 2020 in the next presidential. I want to win this and then I'll win that. Tonight we're thrilled to be joined by several really terrific Arizona Republicans, including Representatives Debbie Lesko -- Debbie?
Where's Debbie? Where is she? Debbie did a good job. Debbie was very tough. She did a good job. Thank you, Debbie. Great job, Debbie. A man who has been in there and he has been fighting for me day in and day out. He's a winner. He loves this state. He loves this country. I watched him this morning. I heard him.
I heard he was on. So I wanted to turn on and I wanted to watch Congressman Andy Biggs, and he did a great job. Andy? Thank you, Andy. Great job. And a man that we all love, and he's solid, and he helped us with health care and he helped with every single aspect of what we're doing, tax cuts, borders, he's tough, he's smart, and you love him.
Dave Schweikert. Dave? Thank you, Dave. Great job. We're also honored to be joined by your fantastic governor and friend of mine, Doug Ducey. And don't worry about it, Doug. That's "Du, Du," just that's not -- it is, too. That's pretty impressive when you get -- Doug is fantastic. And get out and vote for Doug, by the way.
Get out and vote. He's great. He's doing a great job. He loves this state, loves the country. Finally, it is my great honor to introduce a true American patriot, a person I've gotten to know very well over the last two years. She was always there for us, and she's tough and she's smart and she's brave, and she can fly an aeroplane better than anybody.
Your next United States senator from Arizona, Martha McSally. Come up, Martha.
All right. You guys are awesome. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you so much, President Trump. Thank you for coming to Arizona. And I just wanted to let you know, we are not crazy here. Unlike what my opponent says, we are not a meth lab of democracy. Is that ridiculous? Arizona is an amazing state, and I'm really, really glad you're here.
I'm so grateful for your support. Look, America is back. And Arizona is back. Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and Doug Ducey and the Republican Senate and the House. We see so much optimism, we have so many job opportunities, we are rebuilding our military and supporting our troops. And we have Justice Brett Kavanaugh on the bench.
But there is so much more to do. And there are so high stakes in this election. And we are down to the wire to make sure that we keep and grow the Senate majority. Think about it, the contrast could not be more clear. I said I would vote for Kavanaugh. Sinema says she would vote no. Hey? Hey? On national security, I advocated and we fought and kept the A-10 Warthog.
And Sinema -- Sinema advocated to shut down Luke Air Force Base. Boo. We just were visiting at Luke Air Force Base, and you can see what a treasure that is. I was shooting at the Taliban and Sinema says it's OK for an American to join the Taliban. What the hell? Right? And I was wearing a flight suit, and she was wearing a pink tutu.
And on economic security, you know I voted for your tax cuts and Sinema voted no. And most importantly for us, on border security, President Trump, it has been an honor to be leading in the House to make sure we build the wall. Build the wall. [Audience Chants Build the wall] Exactly. We have to do it. We got to close these crazy loopholes.
And my legislation, working with you, closes these loopholes. We have so much more to do. My opponent and her allies, Chuck Schumer, they are so dangerous on these issues. Sinema voted to protect sanctuary cities. Yeah. And look, this is personal. In the audience tonight is Mary Ann Mendoza, and her son, Bryan -- her son, Bryan, a Mesa sergeant in the Mesa Police Department, was killed by a man who didn't belong being here and should have been gone.
And this is personal for Mary Ann. This is personal for us in Arizona. We have to crack down on sanctuary cities, MS-13 gangs, build the wall and secure the border. So there's so much at stake. There's so much at stake. And so I'm grateful for your support. I'm grateful for your vote. God bless you all. God bless Arizona.
God bless America. Thank you. [Audience Chants USA]
That's fantastic. Martha's a veteran. A great veteran, a great fighter, a war hero. And the first female fighter pilot to fly combat missions in American history. Think of that. She's the first. And I spoke to some of the pilots and fighters just now, we just left. And we had an incredible display of talent.
Boeing was there. And Raytheon was there. And they were all there, everybody was there. And the ones that know Martha, they say they should could fly a plane like nobody. I like that. That's good. That's good. They were very impressed. They were very impressed. You deserve a senator who truly loves your state and loves to fight for the state and who will never let you down, and that leader is, indeed, Martha McSally.
And Martha's opponent is a far-left extremist named Kyrsten Sinema. And, you know, she is. She's being protected by the fake news back there. Boy, that's a lot -- look at all the people. It's like the Academy Awards -- look at this. That's a lot of stuff. You think this happens to the average president? No way.
And every single time, I hope you're enjoying yourselves. You can turn the cameras back on them. I won't say anything bad, I promise. Now, when they think I'm ready to say something bad, all those red lights go off. You know, just -- now, turn them. I'm not going to leave you alone. After 9/11, Martha McSally heroically led air strikes against radical Islamic terrorists.
Very successful. But while Martha was bravely fighting the Taliban, Kyrsten Sinema said she had no problems with Americans defecting from our country to join the Taliban. How does that happen? Seriously, how does that happen in Arizona? Explain that one to me. Sinema made these comments even as courageous American servicemembers were giving their lives in the fight against enemy Taliban forces.
Kyrsten Sinema also embraced a left-wing radical who was convicted of providing material support to terrorists. This is what you want as your senator? I don't think so. I don't think so. And as you know, and as you heard, Kyrsten Sinema voted strongly against tax cuts. Now, not because she believes that, but because Nancy Pelosi told her to do it. That's all it is. Nancy Pelosi doesn't believe it. And Maxine Waters told her to do it, too.
That's true. She doesn't believe that. But they told her to do it. They'll do -- she'll do whatever they tell them. She voted for Obama's amnesty and she voted against a border wall. She wants to let poisonous drugs pour into your communities and that's where they're coming, right through. Sinema voted to support deadly sanctuary cities, and Sinema joined the shameful Democrat mob attacking the great Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
He will be great. He will be a great Supreme Court justice. And a vote for Kyrsten Sinema is a wasted vote, but more importantly, it's a dangerous vote, because it's for Schumer, cryin' Chuck, for Pelosi and for Maxine Waters. If you don't want radical Democratic mob to control Congress, vote today, get out and vote before -- you don't have to wait.
Vote for Martha McSally. It'll be one of the best votes you've ever cast. It will be -- it will be the second greatest vote you ever cast. The first greatest vote was for me! Me! No, when you cast a vote for me, you cast a vote for you, too. It's us. Because we have -- and they never question me on this -- I say it all the time -- we have the greatest movement in the history of our country.
Never happened. It's never happened before. And we're doing great, the greatest president. Thank you. I like him. Look, who said that? Thank you, man. Thank you. We're working hard. We're working hard. Democrats in Congress have already signed up for a socialist takeover of health care that would eliminate the private health insurance of 3.4 million Arizona residents.
You know about that. And it's going to destroy our country, and your taxes will be tripled. The Democrat plan would destroy Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage for over 500,000 Arizona seniors who depend on it. Democrats' plan to kill Medicare Advantage is especially unfair to Hispanic Americans, of which we have a couple in the room, right?
A couple. We're doing very well with Hispanic Americans. We're doing very well. Because you know what? They want safety at the border. They want great jobs. Remember, the last election, well, he won't do too well with the Hispanic vote. Did we do well or what? They're still -- they're still -- they're still trying to figure it out.
And remember they said, oh, but he won't do well with women. Did we do well with women? We did well with women. They haven't figured it out yet, but they're trying. Are you trying? You continue or do you just want to play this game? Do you want to keep playing this game? One out of every two Hispanic seniors is enrolled in Medicare Advantage, which they're going to destroy.
Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors, who have earned it and they've paid for it. And Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. They're trying to put a false narrative out there. And if there is a Republican out there that doesn't, let me know. I'll -- believe me, him or her, we'll talk them into it. We're going to protect pre-existing conditions.
It's -- put it down and bank. Remember during the debates, everyone wanted to re-adjust your Social Security, let's add some years on, listen. Who is the one person that said I'm not touching entitlements? Thank you. Thank you. And remember I said, right, and I haven't, I haven't. There's been a lot of presidents that have made big promises.
All of a sudden their career is over, you know, you know a few of them. You've watched it. And it's not a pretty sight when it happens. It's not pretty at all. Not going to happen to me. But I was on stage during all those debates, which we won, by the way, every single one of them. But I was on stage with all those debates, first with some really fine people, the Republicans, and then with a very dishonest person, crooked Hillary Clinton.
And during that time, and during... [Audience Chants Lock her up] It is amazing how you can delete 33,000 e-mails after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress and our Justice Department doesn't do anything about it. It is pretty amazing. Our Justice Department. Headed by many people from the Obama administration.
Can't win them all, but it'll work out, folks. It'll all work out. Just like you look at what we've done. You look at every department, you look at what's going on, secretary of state, you look at EPA, you look at everyone. We are doing so well. We are really hitting. The new platform of the Democrat Party is radical socialism and open borders.
As we speak, the Democrat Party is openly inviting millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and overwhelm our nation. Other than that, the Democrats are doing a great job, right? Not too good. You know what? They're lousy politicians. They have horrible policy. They do one thing well.
They stick together. They really do. They stick together, better than the Republicans. The one thing they do -- and they stick -- they don't want us to have the victory of a wall, even though we got much more money for our military. Many, many times more. We got money. But they don't want us to have the wall.
Even though they know it's the right thing. They will fight to the death because they don't want us to have the wall. But we've started the wall anyway, and we're going to get that done. We're going to get it done. And now it's as a point -- when you look, it's really at a point when you look at what's pouring over in these caravans, when they start saying we don't want to change those immigration laws that are so bad, catch-and-release, we don't want to change visa lottery... Think of visa lottery.
They pick names out of a hat, visa lottery. Think about it. Do you think that this country, whichever country it is, are they going to put you -- are they going to put their finest in there? I don't think so. I don't think so. Chain migration, you come over, and then they have -- we had a guy on the West Side Highway.
He goes down the highway, he's going 60, 70 miles an hour, radical Islam, terrible. Makes a right turn into a park, kills nine people, badly injures -- nobody ever talks about. People that are running along the beautiful Hudson River, because they want to stay in shape. They end up going home six months later with no legs, with no arms.
Because of people like this, sick people. These are sick people. And these allowed -- this guy had 22 people. He brought in his mother, his father, his brother, his sisters, his aunts, his uncles. Because of Democrats' policy. That's called chain migration. It's a chain. Sounds so good. Like right out of -- like right of school.
Sounds so beautiful. The chain, everyone comes together. Nope. We're ending it, folks. And the Democrats don't want to do it, but we're ending it, folks. And catch-and-release. How about that? That's my favorite. Catch. You catch a damned killer, you catch a bad hombre. You catch a bad one. You take the name.
And we're supposed to bring them to court, but we have hundreds of thousands of people. And it's all my fault. You know why? Because we, I, you, all together, we've made this country so strong economically so good, jobs, everything, that everybody wants to come in, so it's my fault. But you know what? We're not letting them in. We only are going to let people in based on merit.
We need people to come in based on merit. So you have catch-and-release. They put one foot. They don't need two. One foot! We have the greatest people, ICE, Border Patrol, law enforcement. And the law doesn't allow us to throw them the hell out. We have to take 'em. We have to write them up, and then we say come back in three years for a court case.
In the meantime, they're released into our society. And you know what the percentage of people that come back for the case? Three percent. No, you're wrong. He said zero. You were slightly off. Three percent. Three percent show up three years, four years, five years later. It's a disgrace. And the Democrats do it. And we don't have enough votes.
We don't have enough Republicans to override their negative vote, because they do stick together. And remember this: They're only sticking together because they want to make sure that I and we don't get what they know our country needs. But I think they may be forced politically to do it, because I got to tell you, anybody that votes for a Democrat now is crazy.
When you look at what's coming up, crazy. Got to be crazy. The Democrats don't care about what their extremist immigration agenda will do to your communities, your hospitals. How about your hospitals? They're being overrun. Your schools! California, they want to give you free education, free health care, open borders.
I mean, we're going to have 10 million people move to California. This is the craziest thing. So here's what we do. Let's get these people out of there. There's something wrong. They're cuckoo. The Democrats don't care that a flood of illegal immigration is going to totally bankrupt our country. Because all the Democrats want is power.
And don't forget: Everybody that comes across the border, for the most part, they're going to vote Democrat. They're not voting Republican. They're going to vote Democrat. So nobody said they're stupid. But it's bad for our country. But they're going to vote Democrat. No matter what we do, they will be voting Democrat.
And they understand that. That's why Democrats support programs like catch-and-release. That's why Democrats want to give illegal aliens free welfare, free health care, and free education. Give them a driver's license. Give them a driver's license. Next thing you know, they want to buy them a car. Then they'll say the car's not good enough, we want -- how about a Rolls-Royce?
Give them -- we want a Rolls-Royce. Made not in America, so therefore, I hope that's not what we do. That's why Democrats want to give illegal immigrants the right to vote. How about in California, where illegal immigrants took over the town council, and now the town council is run by illegal immigrants in the town!
I mean, is this even believable? You tell this stuff. It is sick! That's why Democrats want to abolish ICE, the most brave people. These people -- I wouldn't want their job. Nobody up here wants their job. I can tell by looking. They go into the toughest situations. We call them nests. Nests of very bad people.
They don't like using guns. They'd much rather use knives, because it's much more painful and slower. These are really bad people. And ICE goes in there. And it's like a day at the office. No problem. And they free towns, like in Long Island. They liberate towns. It's like liberation from a war. They liberate towns.
And the Democrats think that ICE isn't nice. We have to get rid of ICE. We cherish ICE. And we cherish Border Patrol. And we cherish our law enforcement. The casualties in the Democrats' open borders crusade are innocent American families and lives. And we have some of these incredible people with us tonight.
Democrat immigration policies allow poisonous drugs, vicious gang members, and MS-13 killers to pour into our country, and we've done a great job. We have removed thousands of MS-13 -- get them the hell out. Thousands! Thousands and thousands. And Democrat sanctuary cities release dangerous predators out of a jail and straight into your communities.
This is not what you want. I know the people of Arizona, you don't want -- you don't want it. A Democrat victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation to every trafficker, smuggler, drug dealer, and illegal alien on the planet, come on in. Come on in, folks. A Republican victory would send the message that America will enforce our borders and defend our citizens.
It's important. This is your choice in November. This is your real choice. I don't think personally -- I don't think you have a choice, but what am I? How can I say that? You're supposed to vote. I don't think you have a choice, OK? I know the people in this room too well. Democrats believe illegal border crossers should be immediately set free.
Republicans believe illegal border crossers should be immediately sent home or, if they're criminals, put in jail. Democrats believe our country should be a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens. They want it to be a big, fat, beautiful sanctuary city. The whole country for criminal aliens. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary city for law-abiding Americans.
Democrats believe American taxpayers should provide free welfare to illegals. That's wonderful. How about California? They owe two million, trillion dollars! They owe more money than any place has ever even dreamt of. And now they have a man running for governor who wants to actually let the entire world pour into a state, give them free welfare, free education, free licenses, free everything.
And they have no money. And they have no money. And they owe a fortune. Other than that, it's a great idea. Republicans believe welfare should be protected for truly needy Americans that need it. If you want to save your country, if you want to protect your family, if you want to defend American laws, the borders, the sovereignty, the dignity, then you must vote for Martha and vote for Republican on November 6th or before.
This election is also about prosperity. In less than two years, we have created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Think of that. Hispanic American household income is at an all-time high. Who is a Hispanic American in this room? Ten percent? It's all right.
Do you like Trump? It's always dangerous. Always dangerous. [Audience Chants Trump] Thank you. Thank you, guys. [Audience Chants Trump] Hispanic American poverty has reached an all-time historic low. Hispanic American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded in history. African American and Asian American unemployment have reached their lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country.
And women's unemployment at 3.6 percent is the lowest it's been in 65 years. Every day we are living by our motto, promises made, promises kept. And some of the fake news -- and they know, they say that I made promises and I actually kept more promises than I made. I think we've done more than we've even said.
And we're not finished. We're not finished yet. We're not finished. Two weeks ago, I announced that we are replacing the horrible, disgusting, terrible, terrible NAFTA deal with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement, the USMCA. All done. Great deal. Got to be approved by Congress, but even the Democrats like it. Can you believe that?
Can you believe it? Chuck Schumer actually said really good things about it. Can you believe it? It'll be approved pretty quickly, and that opens up Canada and Mexico to the farmers and to manufacturers. It's a great thing for hopefully all three countries. But this is going to be a great day. NAFTA was a disaster.
We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's highly abusive trade practices. And we're winning. We're winning. And Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in American history, including ANWR in Alaska. They couldn't get it passed, the biggest site drilling -- biggest site just about in the world.
Just about in the world. And President Reagan really tried, great guy, couldn't get it done. President Bush, all of them. And I got it done. I got it done. Alaska. The people in Alaska like me. Well, my grandfather spent a lot of time in Alaska. He was looking for gold. Wasn't so easy to find, but he was looking.
We also passed veterans' choice for our great, great, great people. Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor. And the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats or hurts our veterans in any way is accountable. We look at them, and we say, Jim, sorry to do this, you're fired.
Get your ass out of here. Couldn't fire them. You couldn't fire them. We were stuck. We secured $700 billion and then next year $716 billion to fully rebuild our great American military. And our military will very shortly be far stronger, far more powerful, modern, the best in the world, and also it's jobs.
Now, when it's come to the military, I don't care about the jobs so much. I want the strong military. But as a secondary benefit, every ounce of it is built in the United States. And we make the best planes and the best ships and the best rockets and missiles. We make the best stuff. So it's a lot of jobs.
And we will soon have far and away the strongest military that we've ever had. And hopefully, you know what, it'll be so strong and so powerful that we won't have to use it, OK? If it wasn't powerful, we probably would have to use it. That's the way life works. At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create a sixth branch of the American armed forces called the Space Force.
Very serious. Very serious. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. A disaster. And you remember the day before I came into office, it looked like Iran was just going to take over the Middle East. There was no stopping them. Guess what? They're struggling right now. They're really struggling.
They're having riots every weekend. They are struggling right now. They are having a hard time. And we've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Together we have made extraordinary progress. The progress that we've made is I think unparalleled certainly for the first two years.
And, you know, we're still quite a bit short. We have a ways to go. January 20th. We have a ways to go. But nobody has done more than we've done in the first two years and not even close. And we're just getting started. If you vote to elect a Republican House and a Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes.
We will protect Medicare and Social Security. And Democrats will destroy them both, and you know it. We will continue to confirm judges who interpret our Constitution as written. We will secure the border. We will pass Kate's law. We will end sanctuary cities. Stop catch-and-release, visa lottery, chain migration, out.
And we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists the hell out of our country. We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependents to independents, and poverty to prosperity. For years, you watched as your leaders apologize for America, right? Remember? Remember the bowing, all the bowing!
People forget about the bowing. I remember. I didn't like it. All the bowing. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for the people of Arizona. We are proudly standing up for our great national anthem. But to continue this incredible momentum, to defend your state and your country, I need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote for Martha McSally, November 6th, is the latest, but vote early.
Martha's a courageous fighter. She's the person you need in Washington. You will be so proud of her. She loves this state so much, you will be -- seriously, you will be so proud of her. A vote -- thank you. She said I'm proud of you, too. A vote -- that's all right. People always say, oh, this is going to be an easy job.
Nothing easy about it, folks. That's all right. Not that easy. But we love it. You know why we love it? They just asked me recently, do you like it? It's hard. I said it's only hard because I choose to work 24 hours a day. I can make it easy. I don't have to do this. I don't have to do this. But you know why I love it? Because we are accomplishing so much, far greater than anybody ever thought, including them.
And they give us credit for it. They have been. They have been. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs, more wealth, and more products made right here in the USA. That's what we want. Remember? It's a vote to respect our laws and respect the heroes of law enforcement. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of hatred, anger, and division, and to celebrate the greatness and the glory of being an American.
And it is. It's great, and it's glorious. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people, and that's happening. From Phoenix to Flagstaff, from Mesa to Yuma, to the Red Rocks of Sedona, this great state was settled by some of the toughest men and toughest and most beautiful women ever to walk the face of the Earth.
Now they're going to say tomorrow, he called women beautiful. Isn't that terrible? It'll be Trump calls women beautiful. You're beautiful! You are beautiful. You're beautiful. You always were, and you always will be. And it's funny, I'm thinking, I'm just watching this -- I think we got him. I think we got him.
I think we got him. You're beautiful. Arizona is where Wyatt Earp became a legend, where the American West became the American dream, and where generations of farmers, ranchers, pioneers, and soldiers use their own two hands to build a life and to build a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury.
But they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. These courageous Arizona patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win.
We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never, ever, ever back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory, always. Because we are American and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
And together, with the proud people of Arizona, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Arizona. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Minnesota. This is a great state. We are going to win this state in a very short period of time. Thank you. This feels like the day before the election. So we have 20,000 plus people inside. We just set a new record and we have 25,000 people that we still love outside and close to 100,000 people wanted to come tonight.
Thank you, all. This is great. This is great. Thank you. I want to thank our great Vice President, Mike Pence and Karen Pence for being here tonight. It is great to be back in the Twin Cities with the freedom-loving American patriots who make our country run. You know that. You know it. For the next 13 months, think of that, it seems like yesterday.
For the next 13 months, we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul, and we are going to win the great state of Minnesota in 2020. America now has the number one economy anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. You know I'm dealing with China right now. They're in Washington, we're going to see we make a deal, but they want to make it. We're going to determine whether or not we want to make it. But they've been very nice, and today, I got a call from one of the top representatives.
He said congratulations, Mr. President, on having a truly great, great economy. That's pretty nice. We picked up since the election trillions of dollars in value and China has lost trillions of dollars in value. I will say this: if our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now China would become the night -- it would be the number one economy anywhere in the world.
And right now I can tell you, they're not even close. Our country is stronger than ever before because we are proudly putting, for the first time in a long time, we are putting America first. [Audience chants "USA"] And I have to say, there are a lot of very beautiful red T-shirts in the audience. That was a record sale.
They did very well and I'll tell you what, cops love Trump, Trump loves cops. Our bold pursuit of this pro-American agenda has enraged, and you know what's happened, it's enraged the failed ruling-class in Washington, not easy to get them out, but we're doing it slowly but surely. These corrupt politicians and the radical leftist got rich bleeding America dry and they knew that by-election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country.
And that's what they were doing and that's what they continue to try and do. That is why from day one the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and Democratic election, the election of 2016. They're trying, they're not getting very far. They want to erase your vote like it, never existed.
[Audience shouts "Boo"] They want to erase your voice and they want to erase your future, but they will fail because in America the people rule again. Do you remember that just 19 minutes after I raised my hand and took the oath of office, the Washington Post, a terrible newspaper that doesn't know how to write the truth, published a story, and in this case they might have gotten it pretty correct?
They said the campaign to impeach President Trump has begun. That was the headline. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Little did we know they weren't playing. Think of that. That was 19 minutes after the oath of office, months earlier, Peter Strzok [Audience shouts "Boo"] remember he and his lover, Lisa Page. What a group.
She's going to win, 10 million to one, she's going to win. I'm telling you, Peter. I'm telling you, Peter, she's going to win, Peter. Oh, I love you so much. I love you, Peter. I love you too, Lisa. Lisa, lisa, oh God, I love you, Lisa. And if she doesn't win Lisa, we've got an insurance policy Lisa. We'll get that son of a bitch out.
We got an insurance -- and we're living through the insurance policy. That's what it is. The phony Russia hoax. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Lisa, I love you. Now the do-nothing Democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate. Thirteen months, they got to move fast because they're not beating us at the polls and they know it despite the phony, despite the phony polls that you see all the time.
They have phony polls, you know, polls are no different. Remember, I always used to talk about polls. I know polls very well. Polls are no different than crooked writers. They're crooked polls, crooked polls -- no different. Well, that's a lot of media. Look back there. That's a lot of media. [Audience shouts "Boo"] They are so dishonest and frankly, they are so bad for our country.
They are so bad and they could be so good for our country. They could be so good, and maybe they'll change, and maybe they won't. I've been waiting for a long time. You know after I won the last election, I said you know, finally, it's OK. Finally, I get some great press. They got worse. They got worse. I said finally, we're going to get -- I said to the first lady, darling, we're going to finally get respect, we're going to finally get media and press coverage that's going to be great.
Look at what we've done and I'm telling you they did. They got worse. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And they know they cannot win. You understand. Well, if you didn't understand honestly, there's no way anybody could win because you'd believe them. If you believed them there's no way anybody could win. It's just like 94%, I can do the greatest thing in history and they'll make them bad to very bad.
And if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out OK, they're great now -- It's like give him the electric chair. That was terrible, right? No, this is the worst. [Audience member calls out "We love you, Trump"] These people and the Democrats, they are partners. It's a partnership. How about in the newscast like the word manufactured.
It's manu -- and every newscaster, tonight in a manufactured deal along the border -- the word's never been used, now all of a sudden, all of the newscasters are using it. It's a talking point given to these fakers by the Democrats. So they know they can't win the 2020 election. So they're pursuing the insane impeachment which I've been going through it now.
[Audience shouts "Boo"] I've been going through it now for more time than I've been in office because, you know, like Strzok with his insurance deal, this was before. Remember this, this was before -- that statement was made months before I took office. That statement was made months before the election took place.
They said just in case, we're going to have an insurance policy. That only means one thing, we're going to get him out. So they're telling us. We can't let that ever happen again to another President. And Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, a lot of people, the great Mark Levin, we have a lot of great people, Lou Dobbs, great people.
You know what they said? Every one of them plus many others, there's no other man that we've ever met that could have taken it. It's true, maybe I'm a little different up here. I don't know, but I enjoy it. To me, it's, I'm energized because we're draining the swamp. [Audience chants "Drain the swamp"] The Democrats' brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box, the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country.
These are bad people. My phone call as an example with the President of Ukraine. It was perfect, everybody that looked at it and the only reason I released it was that the Democrats put out a phony narrative. So I had no choice and I don't want to do that as President. Every time a President from a country calls me or I call them, we have to release the text.
How can you do business that way? Who's going to want to speak to your President? So the President of Ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference on other subjects that he was under absolutely no pressure. He doesn't know what they're talking about and he used the word, there was no blackmail during this call.
He used that term. So in theory, that should be the end of it. Think of it. A President of the United States who's made our economy with a lot of help from all of you frankly, but from Mike and from some of our great Senators and some of our great people that we have with us. We made this the strongest economy in our history.
We've rebuilt our military, we're taking care of healthcare like nobody's been able to do. What we've done is incredible, and by the way, we're protecting your Second Amendment. If you don't have me, your Second Amendment is gone. So we have the greatest economy, the greatest military, we've rebuilt our military, $2.5 trillion because when I took it over, it was a mess, and what do they want to do? Let's impeach a President.
Try it. I don't think so. I don't think so. I think we're going to have a turnout, the likes of which, we've never seen in the history of our country. So we were really forced, just to put it away, we were forced, I said just do it. Got the approval from Ukraine. I have to ask, I said hey, do you guys mind?
They said that's a strange request, they said don't worry about it. Do you mind? And they said please, go ahead. Nothing was said wrong in that call. So we released the transcript of the call which was so good that that crooked Adam Schiff, this guy is crooked. [Audience shouts "Boo"] He had to make up a fake conversation that never happened and he delivered to the United States Congress and the American people.
It was a total fraud and then Nancy Pelosi said, oh, I think the President said that. These people are sick. I'm telling you they're sick, and you know what had they waited one day longer, they would have had the transcript of the actual call, word for word, and it would have been perfect. Instead, they released it, they went early.
They said all these horrible things. Do you know why? Because they never thought in a million years that I was going to release a transcript of the call. So Nancy Pelosi, upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call, or somebody gave a very bad advice, but also hearing it from shifty Schiff, Nancy Pelosi said, a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the Ukrainian President, we've got to impeach him.
We've got to impeach him, right? And then she saw the call and she said to her people, what the hell? Nobody ever told me this was the call. But she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their head. The do-nothing Democratic extremists have gone so far left that they believe it should not be crime to cross our border illegally, and it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate, casual, beautiful, accurate phone call with a foreign leader.
I don't think so. As our brilliant Whitehouse counsel wrote to the Democrats yesterday, he said their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people. That's what it is. To the American people.
It's so terrible. Democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy. That's what's happening. We will never let it happen. We will defeat them. I mean, look at their debates. These people are crazy. They want to spend $99 trillion to redo buildings all over the United States. I said what about China? What about Russia?
What about India? What about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out? It's all right. Let him give you the answer. Man do the cops act fast. He's already gone. Man, that's unbelievable. That's the fastest. You know I have -- look, I love law enforcement. I love the cops. I love the police, I love Minneapolis.
Minneapolis. You've got a rotten Mayor. You've got to change your Mayor. You've got a bad Mayor, got a bad Mayor, but you know what? The police I've done this a lot, and every once in a while, you have -- very little disturbance. It's really -- actually is there any place where we can have more fun than at a Trump rally?
And we've set every record at every place virtually that we've gone, and one of the big musicians said, and Trump does it without a guitar. Can you believe without a guitar? But this guy, so I've had it a lot where, you know, but sometimes It'll take the police like 30 seconds, 50 seconds, it's like Roger Penske, when you watch him -- who's getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom by the way very soon.
Great. He won 18 Indy 500, 18, Roger Penske, but it's like the way they change those tires. It takes four seconds to change a whole damn thing. I say how the hell did they do it? That's the way these cops just reacted. That was a record. I think it was. I've had good service but I've never had anything like that.
I look up, the guy is already gone. We love you with the red shirts. So now the Democrats are making a pathetic bid to save sleepy Joe, sleepy Joe Biden. [Unidentified] And you know what, I'd love to run against him to be honest. Anybody like that, if you can't beat him in a debate, you've got a big problem folks.
You can't beat him in a debate, you can't be President, because what are you going to do against President Xi and Kim Jong-un? You can't beat sleepy Joe, but now we're going to meet with Kim Jong-un. I don't think so. But he's totally owned and totally controlled by the Washington swamp for many years. Two months after President Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy, they put Joe Biden in charge of Ukraine policy.
Listen to this, and the press won't write it. They say, in totally unsubstantiated charges, every time they talk about him. President Trump has said his son walked away with a fortune. Now you know that's a totally unsubstantiated charge, really? It's not unsubstantiated, it's fact. Joe's son, Hunter, got thrown out of the navy and then he became a genius on Wallstreet two days.
By the way, whatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he? Where's Hunter? Hey, fellas, I have a new idea for a new T-shirt. I love the cops but let's do another T-shirt, where's Hunter? Where is he? Here's Hunter being examined by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd or some of these people. Hunter, it's so great that you're here, sir.
Um, Hunter, I know they're giving you approximately $168,000 a month. I hear they paid you a big check of $3 million, I just want to speak, on behalf of NBC, who's absolutely one of the worst, I just want to tell you. Hunter, Hunter, I just want to tell you, I couldn't be happier for you and your family and I know you don't know anything about energy, and I know it's an energy company.
But I think they made a great deal, Hunter. And then they fly to China and I'm dealing with people right now. They're tough as hell those Chinese negotiators. And Hunter is not too smart. He goes in, he has a meeting, he walks out in his fund with $1.5 billion, with a B, billion dollars. These aren't the same Chinese negotiators that I'm dealing with, I can tell you.
These are not the same ones but we are doing very well in that negotiation. Now think of it, where's Hunter? OK get -- where is Hunter? I want to see Hunter asked this way. Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, you're a loser.
Why did you get $1.5 billion, Hunter? And your father was never considered smart, he was never considered a good Senator. He was only a good Vice President because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's ass. [Audience chants "USA"] Thank you. Thank you. It's true. It's true and they're always saying the same thing.
Yeah, he got $1.5 billion, we admit it, they admit it. There's nothing but always that same thing, President Trump made a totally unsubstantiated claim about Hunter Biden and his father. It's not unsubstantiated you crooked son of a guns. It's 100% true. Even the smart guys on Wallstreet and I know all of them, and they are smart.
They've never seen anything like that one before. I'd call them, does that ever happen, never happens. Guy walks in, no experience, no nothing, walks out with a big and five G, flies in on Air Force Two with his father, the Vice President. Don't forget, that's when he was Vice President. So China gives his son $1.5 billion.
How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don't think so. I don't think so. Meanwhile, Biden allowed China to rip off America for eight years, as Vice President and Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we're not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich and that is substantiated while America got robbed.
That's what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends sold out America. They didn't have tough negotiations. I look at these trade deals and I'd say who the hell could have done this? If you didn't, if you had no business instinct, no business ability, if you had nothing, if you're dumb as hell, you wouldn't make these deals, They're so bad.
I say who made these deals? Who made these deals? But we're ripping them all up and redoing them and they're going to be very good. Wait 'til you see what happens and now that I'm your President, you see it. America is winning again and we're respected again as a nation. [Audience chants "USA"] And in a brand new report, just came out as I'm walking on the stage, hard to believe actually.
It turns out that Joe Biden was Vice President. He worked with the so-called whistleblower. This is nothing but a partisan witch hunt sabotage and I'm sure they're going to say, it's totally unsubstantiated, but one of them wrote this story. Congratulations, by the way. Congratulations, that's really good.
That's the way you should do it. Good. Good. Good. In the twisted worldview of Democrats and the media, it's OK for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries, flood our communities with drugs and crime, and enrich themselves at America's expense. Their treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged Washington game and it is far more rigged.
When I ran, I thought it was rigged but this is crazy what's happening. But if you refuse to bow or bend to the Washington swamp, which I could do very easily, I'd be much more popular. Folks, I'd be -- it would be so much easier. You know a very smart, I got it and I got to tell you isn't it much better when I go off script?
Isn't that better? So much and it's just, it's just -- hey folks, the greatest buyer of advertisements in the history of the world, Mike Lindow, my pillow. I have never seen so many ads. I think he's the greatest ad negotiator in history, and I told him, I said would you do me a favor? All the money we spend in these political campaigns, if I gave some of that money to Mike, I think we'd have ads every single minute of every single shot.
I never saw so many. Anyway -- but the lawless political establishment will try to frame you, they'll persecute you, they'll swear, and just swear up and down that they're telling the truth. When Nancy Pelosi was on television the other day, I have to say, I have to say, I was very proud of George Stephanopoulos.
I was very proud. It's not often, she said no, no, shifty Schiff told the truth when he said that. Stephanopoulos said no, wait a minute, no, it wasn't the truth. It was a falsehood. No, no, it's the truth. He said no and did she -- she really believes it. So she's either got one of two problems: she's either really stupid, OK, or she's really lost it, or maybe there's a certain dishonesty in this some -- but they smear you.
They spy on you, and they target your friends, your family, your staff for harassment, for abuse, for destruction. I came down to Washington with incredible people. We want a great political campaign. They were bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. We know that's a nice phrase. They came down. They were happy, they wanted to turn the country around.
They wanted to do great things, all of a sudden, they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by Robert Mueller. How good was he is a witness? Not too good. And by people that were, I call them, the 13 angry Democrats that turned into 18 angry Democrats. It was disgraceful. So people that were going down. Sir, what is this?
I look, oh wow, that's a subpoena. What the hell is this? They took people, I really mean this, they took people that were full of life and energy and vigor. We had just won the greatest campaign in the history of American politics. It's true. It's true and they destroyed their lives. They destroyed their lives.
They went home. I could name many people, one in particular, who came down, an incredible young woman. She was going to help people. She wanted to help people, she had causes that was so good, she wanted to help people, and she ended up going home. Dark, dark. Her life became hell. They ruined people. They destroyed -- they destroyed people, good people.
People that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made than they made. They destroyed great people. They're vicious, horrible, and the media was behind every single step. [Audience shouts "Boo"] They destroyed so many lives. They destroyed so many lives and they're continuing to do it, and it's a disgrace.
When all of their ludicrous hoaxes have been exposed as frauds, these sinister fakers, then tried to impeach you for daring to call out their own corruption. There's nothing like the dirty political establishment, and I have to tell you, this is you know a friend of mine, very smart, brilliant guy, he was with me about two weeks ago.
We just got rid of the Russia hoax and then, a week later, the Ukraine hoax starts. I had a week of like, I can think about everything perfect, it's so beautiful and he said President, I said call me Donald, you've called me Donald for 35 years. I will, thank you, Donald. I've lost all my friends because they're all scared to talk you know -- like, you know, honestly, I'm the President.
They can't talk to me anymore. It's like they're afraid. They respect the office, it's true, they say, President, I say, do me a favor Richard, you've called me Donald for 35 years. Call me Donald, please. I want somebody to call me Donald. [Audience chants "Donald"] True. He said to me, I just told him call me -- he said President, I can't do it, he said.
So is this President, you've been here now for, think of it, almost three years. Can you believe we're here three years? We, we, it's we. And we have to promise them no more than 16 years, OK? No more. No more, 16 more years, I'm all he could. Now they'll go back, see he wants to run for more but he said, he said, President, can I ask you a question?
It's so important to me. You deal -- he's a great businessman, very successful. He said you deal with all of these nations, these great, powerful, who is the worst to deal with is it China? Is it North Korea? Is it India? Is it Russia? Please tell me, Mr. President, who is the toughest nation to deal with?
I said you're not going to believe this. It's the USA, is the toughest nation to deal with, the USA. It's true because we're dealing with some very sick and deranged people. [Audience shouts "Boo"] There's nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a President that they cannot intimidate, own, and control.
They're, trying to stop me because they know that I don't answer to them, I answer to you. It's true. You know I never say this. I don't think I've ever said it in a speech but maybe they'll find out if I did. Then they'll give me Pinocchio's, he said it before, but I don't know if I ever said it. But you know, I make as President about $4450,000, I give it away.
No, wait. I don't care, I don't care. I never hear anything. Can you imagine if I didn't? I give it away to -- you can only give it. You can't keep it. You can't actually make a gift. You can give it to your different agencies. So I can give it to health, I can give it to transportation, I can give it to military, but I give it away all the time, every -- Now and if I ever did but it's $450,000. If somebody stays from let's say a Middle East country in one of my hotels, and we charge him $392.50 for staying, and I never heard of the guy and I don't want to hear about him.
They say Trump is getting rich off our nation. I lose billions being President, I don't care. It's nice to be rich, I guess. But I lose billions. If somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me two months in rent or hotel fees. I never heard of the people. I never know who they are. They say emoluments.
Nobody ever heard of the word emoluments before. Emoluments, it's the craziest thing I've ever seen. I tell you, it's cost me billions of dollars to be President, it really has. And at some point, I'll probably have to prove that and I look forward to do it. It's very easy. It's very easy. And there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created.
So in a desperate attempt to attack our movement, Nancy and Chuck, two beauties, have given control of the Democrat party entirely over to the radical left, including Minnesota's own representative, Ilhan Omar. [Audience shouts "Boo"] You know, I know you people, I know you people, I know the people of Minnesota, and I want to tell you, and I also at the same time, it's both the question and this statement, how the hell did that ever happen?
How did it happen? How did it happen? Congresswoman Omar is an America-hating socialist. She minimized the September 11th attack on our homeland were far more than 3,000 people died saying some people did something, big deal, some people did something. She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits right here in Minnesota.
Omar left that Americans speak of al-Qaida, do you remember that tape? Speak of al-Qaida but when we say, well, we say something about the United States, you just don't say America with any intensity. Remember that? Representative Omar has a history of launching virulent, anti-semitic screeds, whether you like it or not.
She said the US support for Israel is all about the Benjamins. She said that pro-Israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country. Omar wrote that Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of Israel and the United States. [Audience shouts "Boo"] How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota?
I'm very angry at you people right here. She is a disgrace to our country and she is one of the big reasons that I'm going to win and the Republican Party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months. [Unidentified] Thank you very much. So we're honored to have with us today a special guest, a man that really is a terrific, talented writer.
He knows a great deal about all those tangled lies of Omar, Mr. Scott Johnson of Power Line. He wrote some stuff. I can't believe it. Where's Scott? Where's Scott? Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Scott. What a job. Man, do you have her figured out. The only problem is Scott, it's incredible talent, much more talented than most of these people that you heard about.
The problem is they never pick it up. They don't want to pick it up but we pick it up, Scott, and the people get it, and we thank you for your great reporting. Thank you. Thank you very much. As Scott reported, everything about Omar is a fraud, including her name. Scott reports, his sources told him that quote, Omar's legal husband was Omar's brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes.
You mean, like, coming into the United States, maybe? And as God says, we have seen a plethora of Congressional scandals in our history. Yet we have never seen scandals like Omar's in Congress and nothing gets done about it. I hope, I hope that some of you people are looking because what AOC has gotten away with campaign financing, and what -- I call it AOC plus three, that's what it is and Omar is one of the three.
What AOC has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse and nothing happens to them, but it happens to you, and it's not fair. The fact is, we're in a struggle for the survival of democracy in America. The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020. With your help, we will win back the House, we will keep the Senate, and we will win the White House.
And we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much, one of your tremendous, talented, tough Congressman Tom Emmer, Tom. Also, a man, you don't want to fight him and you don't want to play him in hockey because he was tough. He just won, not that recently but pretty recently, and I was out here campaigning for him and working hard and it turned out to be an easy race because everyone loves him and respects him.
Congressman Pete Stauber. And a man who gets in the trenches and he just doesn't care. He wants to win for the people. He loves you. He loves this state. He loves his country, Jim Hagedorn. And a great friend of mine, with his incredible family, he's a friend, he's smart, I guess, you'd say he's brilliant.
His education is incredible. His military career has been incredible. Then he ran for office and now he's a United States senator from the great State of Arkansas, Senator Tom Cotton. Great guy. And Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka. Paul, thank you, Paul. Minnesota GOP Chairwoman, Jennifer Carnahan.
She's been incredible. I said Jennifer, are we going to win in 13 months? She said honestly, sir, I've never seen anything like this. It's going to be easy. Don't ever say that. Just assume we're like two points behind, OK? Two points behind. You never ever, please, you always just assume you're a little behind but we're going to win this state by so much that people are going to be shocked, and plenty of other states too.
You know we had a rally three weeks ago in New Mexico and New Mexico is a hard state for Republicans, hasn't been won in a long time also, and we had receptivity that was unbelievable. The audience was 40% Hispanic where we're doing great. And you know Hispanic they understand borders better than anybody, better than we do. They understand safety, they understand their job, they don't want people taking it away, they don't want crime, they understand it better that's why we're doing so well.
But we're in New Mexico, and I'm telling you that was electric. But honestly, all evenings are electric. We haven't had any bad ones. We haven't. They're all, all right. A woman who headed up the great state of Michigan for me, a state that hadn't been won in a long time by Republicans for whatever reason, but it hadn't been run.
I guess we didn't have the right candidates, right? But a woman who would call me constantly. I said I don't want to talk to her, she's giving me a headache. Sir, if you make one more trip, you're going to win Michigan. I said all right, I make the trip, I go back home. I get a call the next morning, sir, we need one more.
This went over and over and over, and we ended up winning the state of Michigan, and I said who the hell was that woman that kept bugging me to go back to Michigan? It's just one more time every week, one more time, sir, and her name is Ronna McDaniel, she's fantastic, and she's the head of the RNC. She's great and our campaign manager, a man who's really been -- you know they used to say that crooked Hillary had a very, very sophisticated campaign.
After she lost they said, I guess, it wasn't sophisticated. We had a sophisticated campaign. Nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy, Brad Parscale. Remember when they used to say it? You know I never got credit. My father used to teach me if you can do it for less and win that's good. He wasn't talking politics.
The last thing -- he's looking down. He's definitely looking down, not lookin' up. He was good, he was tough, but he was great. But my father, my father would say, if you could do it for less and win, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. If you can build a building for less money than the guy across the street, and if it's a nicer building, and you can rent for less, you really, that's a good thing.
So in the campaign, we spend much less money than crooked Hillary Clinton, much and we won and we won. We won 306 to 223 that's our pretty big. Remember? Remember they said electoral college, and by the way, when you run, if you're running the electoral college is like the hundred-yard dash and the total vote -- you don't go certain places, you focus.
Electoral college, we had to explain to them. It's different. So we won three or six, and you remember they used to say once the 100-yard dash, you practice, once the mile, you practice. It's a different race. Winning the total vote is much easier, in my opinion. The electoral college, I had to go to 22 different states for the total vote.
I go to like four states maximum, right? Much easier, it's much easier. I'm all for it but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldn't go. I love Maine. I went to Maine four or five times. I needed one point, Maine gave me one point, and what happened?
What happened? I went there numerous times, everyone said why? Because I was told by these fraudsters, back here in the media that Trump, Trump cannot get to 270. He cannot get. They had me maximum and everything worked, right? At 269 so I kept going to Maine. And you know what? We won that one point in Maine.
But I kept going. They say why? I said well, first of all, it is really a beautiful place. But we won the point but they said he cannot get to 270. I heard this for month and months and months. I had such a headache, almost as bad as listening to Mike's damn commercials about those pillows. Maybe I need one of those pillows to cure my headache.
Does it cure headaches? I think so. But here's the thing, here's the thing, so they said he cannot get to 270. In other words, you can't win. If you can't get to 270 you can't win, right? He cannot do it. There's no way of doing it and they were right. I got to 306. They were right but I didn't get to 306, you got to 306. We won in incredible states.
We won Wisconsin. We won Michigan. We won Pennsylvania. We won North Carolina. We won South Carolina. We won Florida. What a run. Do you remember the evening that we won? I think -- look forgetting, I think, it was one of all of us together because we all worked hard. I was the messenger but we all worked hard.
That was our victory, not my victory but that was one of the greatest nights in the history of television, one of the greatest nights. And hopefully, it'll go down when we're allowed to get all of this stuff seeded. You know it's like a tree. You plant it, you plant it, it has to go but it needs a little -- that's why we need the four more additional years.
It's got to grab on and catch so they can't destroy it, so they can't destroy it. But I think it'll go down and I hope it's going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country because it's never happened anything like that before, and these guys don't even question it. They just sit back and say, I guess, he's right about that.
I'll never forget the night before, I was at a tremendous arena. The place was going crazy. It was like this, going crazy, and two reporters that hate my guts, they looked at themselves, they looked at each other, a famous shot. They're looking like this and they're saying, what the hell is going on? They knew.
They knew. And I didn't need Beyonce and Jay-Z, and I didn't need a little Bruce Springsteen and all of these people but they'd come in because you couldn't get a crowd. They'd come in that thing, they got Bruce Springsteen, OK? He'd do about two songs and leave. What happens is they leave and then everyone leaves with him, and she's still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd.
Craziest, craziest thing I've ever seen, and then they complain, sometimes I'll use a terrible word like hell. The other day I use the word hell. I got it. I got hell from -- they said he used terrible language. I used the word hell, it was so bad but you've got to hear Jay-Z, the words he was using. He was using the F-word all over the place, and then the next day they say I use bad language.
The word hell is a terrible word. These people are sick but that was an amazing evening. I'll never forget that evening. It's you know, look, outside of your family and your children and things. [Unidentified] I love you too, darling. It was one of the highest-rated evenings in the history of television.
You add up all those networks. Remember the woman crying, oh, my God. No, they weren't biased at all. Now another very special man who's with us today, but he'll never be a man to me, he'll always be my boy. You know what I mean, right? He's my boy, he's my little six foot six boy, Eric Trump. And the parents understand that, right?
They may be big and strong and older, and to a parent, a child is always their boy or always their little beautiful girl, and I know that's probably politically incorrect. They'll say, it was terrible what he said about women, Carol. But they're our boy and They're our girl, and it doesn't matter how old we get and how old they get.
Is that a correct statement? And I'm also proud to endorse your next Republican Senator from Minnesota, a man that I've known, a man that is tough and smart, a man that's running against somebody that's never done a damn thing in the Senate, Mr. Jason Lewis, and Jason did a great job in Congress. Congressman Lewis, thank you very much, and thank you for putting up with all of this stuff because I'll tell you, it's going to be nasty.
It's going to be nasty. They're going to make up stories about you. They get to say things that's going to want to make your wife say, why did I marry this guy? Just say don't worry about it. It's just another phony story. Thank you very much, Mr. and Mrs. Lewis. Jason, thank you. And Jason, they can't say that about Tom Cotton.
He's too perfect this guy, he can't -- they can't say it about you, Tom. Anyway, good luck, Jason. Do well. And I don't know why but with all of the great people I just introduced for tonight, maybe this is the most important verse because I turned down a very good show in the morning, Fox and Friends. They treat us great.
I just want fair. What a great group, Ainsley and Steve, and by the way, Brian has gotten a lot better, right? Brian was a seven and he's getting close to ten territories, and Steve has been so great, and Ainsley is just incredible. And sometimes Pete Hegseth gets on there for the weekend. And how good does Jesse Waters do? How good?
All right. There's some really great people, and again, Tucker has been very good. I have to say he's been very good. Smart, he's been great, Tucker. And the legendary Sean Hannity, great, number one, number one show. Sean's got the number one show, and Laura Ingram does not get him out of the park, Laura.
And you go over, Maria Bartiromo and the great Lou Dobbs. How good are they? Lou Dobbs and many more, many more. How about Greg? Greg used to hate me, now he's good? Oh, we can't forget, we can't forget, Judge Jeanine. I would be in such trouble if I forgot Judge Jeanine. You know he's a grinder -- anyway, I'm just, you know, look, I'm just rattling some names but they're just terrific people, they're terrific people but a man that I have to really say something very special about.
So I'm watching Fox and Friends early in the morning, very early in the morning like 6:00, like slack because I'm out of there pretty good and I see a handsome young man named Bob Kroll, Cops for Trump, and he's talking about this lousy Mayor. They've gotten -- he didn't quite say that, but I say it, he's talking about this lousy Mayor that won't let the cops, the police, the law enforcement.
You know my father always used to say son, he meant it too, never say cops. It's disrespectful, say, police officers, I say I keep up, but honestly, the truth is with time, I love you guys whether you're cops, police officers, law enforcement, I'll call you whatever you want, it doesn't matter. You are so great, so respected.
You don't even know how much our public loves you, you don't know it. You don't know it. When I see this guy and I don't know if he's done a lot of television before but he was very effective and very good, and he was saying how the police aren't being allowed to take care of this rally. And yet with President Obama and Bush and all these people who were, you know, find -- everybody comes, they fall asleep at a rally but they weren't, they weren't allowed to do the job for us, and they went wild.
So what I want to do [Unidentified] go home to mommy. Mommy says I saw you on television tonight. I love Trump. Don't you ever do that again? Yes, mom, yes. But the job he did before the election, I came right here to Minnesota, and I pledge to address this really important issue, and it's the issue of law enforcement.
And when I saw this man, this great gentleman on television, pouring out his guts, pouring out his heart, I don't know. He knows I've been good to law enforcement. He knows I've been good to, as my father would say, the police. He knows I love the cops. He knows that and so does everyone else. I mean, I've had so many shirts, so many red shirts, and they're plenty people here without the red shirts, and I want to just tell you the respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound. It's unbound. Come up here. Bob come up.
What can I say after that? Tune in Fox 10:15 tonight, Shannon Bream, they asked us on. How can you thank those guys for everything he's done for law enforcement? A wonderful President. Thank you very much.
Thank you, great people. Thank you. What a group, I think, you're very weak Mayor, made a mistake when he took them on. As you know, for many years leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia, without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers.
I promise you that as President, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration control and I've done that. Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%, and as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise.
I issued an executive action making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state. So speak to a Mayor. You should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods, and that's what you have the right to do right now, and believe me, no other President would be doing that.
If Democrats were ever to seize power, they would open the floodgates to unvetted uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before. Do you think gathered bad now? You would never have seen anything like what they want to do but in the Trump administration we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota.
We've also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place. We are keeping terrorists, criminals, and extremists the hell out of our country, and I want to thank the country of Mexico. The President of Mexico has been incredible. We have now 27,000 Mexican soldiers. They're great and they're tough, and they are now protecting our border and those numbers have gone down like -- thank you, Mr. President.
We will not make the mistakes made in European countries that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country on our shores. We're not going to allow it to happen, and as you all know, to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us. I instituted a very controversial, very hard to get travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries.
And the other day, one of the fake news reporters in the back said, they were talking about the travel ban, and they said, well, you know, the President has lost in court, they said where? On the travel ban. And he's right I lost and I lost in the Regional Division, and then, I won in the United States Supreme Court.
Right? And he knew that but he said I lost and he was right. I lost and then I lost again but then, I won. And we have the travel ban. But instead of saying he lost and then he lost at the -- and then he won at the United States Supreme Court, he said, he lost on the travel ban. These are very dishonest people.
You do understand that, very dishonest people. In the Republican party, we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values, honor our history, and love our people. Democrats also deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities and we're not letting it happen anymore.
Republicans believe American cities should be sanctuaries for Americans not for criminal aliens. My administration is taking a historic action to secure the borders. We have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated, it could be built.
And this is a serious wall. You've all seen it. It's going up rapidly and you think that was easy? I had every Democrat in Congress fighting me, fighting me, fighting me. I had a lot of the RINOs fighting me. They say, see he's not getting it built. He not get -- let me tell you. You have every Democrat fighting you.
We took it from here and we took it from there and we took it from all over the place, and we got that thing that's the biggest patchwork of financing you've ever seen, and that sucker is going up, and it is the finest, it is the strongest, it's largely 30-feet tall, which is the maximum height that they wanted.
[Audience chants "Build the wall"] I went to the Border Patrol and I sat down with 15 representatives of the Border Patrol, and I said what do you want? What's your ideal? I actually said I want to give you the Rolls Royce and they killed me for that because it's not an American-made product, they happen to be right.
No, they're right about that one. They're actually right there, Tom. But I said I want to give you the Rolls Royce of walls. Tell me and they told me everything and then we built some alternative walls. We built all different types. We built about seven of them and then we had climbers come in. The one that worked the best was the one we're building.
It also, unfortunately, the bad news is it's also the most expensive, but we got it for the right price. We got it for the right price. It's steel, it's hardened concrete, it's deep, it's high, it's a thing of beauty, and it's going to keep bad people out of our country. That's what it's going to do and the Democrats know this.
Most of the Democrats four years ago, they wanted a wall. Now, all of a sudden, they don't want a wall. You know why they don't want a wall? Because I want it. It's the only reason. And I just thought of it, you know, like a year ago, I said, man, this could have been so much easier. All I had to do is say, we don't want a wall and they would have given me all the financing I wanted for the wall.
What was I thinking? We're not going to build a wall and they would have forced me to build and I would have -- Under this administration, we are also ending the endless wars. We have to do it, folks. We have to do it. We have totally defeated the ISIS caliphate and I did that in rather quick time if you remember because we have the greatest fighting machine.
Now, when I came in it was totally depleted. We have great Generals, we have great warfighters, and they did it so fast. I flew to Iraq. I met with the Generals, right? I met with the Generals. I said I hear it's going to take a year to two years. Sir, we could do it in two weeks. I said what? They don't let us fight, sir.
They don't let us fight. We want to fight. They don't let us fight. I said I'll let you fight. I said how come they say it's going to take anywhere from a year to two years you say you can do it so quickly? He said, sir, we're going to hit them from the front. We're going to hit them from the back. We're going to hit them from the sides, from underground, from over, we're going to hit the hell out of them, and they did, and we won very quickly.
But from now on, we want to fight where it's to the benefit of the United States of America, not to the benefit of other countries, and we will only fight to win. We're only going to fight to win. We don't fight to win, we don't fight to win. The Turks have been fighting with the Kurds for two centuries and Turkey, as you know, is a NATO ally but I've been rough on them.
We've defeated 100% of that ISIS caliphate and no longer have any troops in the area. We don't have any troops. The troops have been pulled out where Turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against the Kurds. Get them out. So Turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the Kurds. We get along with the Kurds and we help the Kurds.
Don't forget they're also fighting for their land, you know that but they're fighting. So we have three choices, are you ready? Here are the three choices. We don't have any soldiers there because we've left. We won, we left. Take a victory United States. We left, take a victory. Take a victory, bring our troops back home.
I told this story yesterday. I have to sign letters. It's the hardest thing I have to do. I signed letters, Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith from Arkansas. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jones from Alabama. Dear Mr. and Mrs.. somebody from some great state. I'm sorry to inform you your son has been killed in combat. I'm so sorry and every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents they're grieving and they get together with other parents and they get -- and I don't want to see that it's like the same letter.
So we do different letters, it's the hardest thing I have to do, hardest thing. It's the hardest thing I have -- I was telling Tom Cotton, it's the hardest thing that I have to do and I signed those letters and it just -- it breaks your heart. And then, and by the way, there's a time to fight. Nobody fights harder than I do. But there's a time and there's not necessarily a time but I send these letters out quite a few and sometimes I send letters out.
It's called Blue and green where we're teaching people how to fight, and then they turned the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back, and that's the hardest thing for a parent. I have all of them. I know every one. That's the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification because they learn how their child has died.
When these so-called people that we're teaching how to fight turned the gun on them, and we've had a lot of that, a lot of it in Afghanistan, more than we've ever had proportionately before. It's a horrible, horrible thing but I have to sign these letters and sometimes I go out to a place, Dover Air Force base.
It's a very tough experience. Mike Pence goes, I go, other people go, Tom Cotton goes, we go out there and we meet the parents and the families, the wives, the children, the sisters, the brothers, we meet them and we talk to them. And their son or daughter is being flown in from some faraway place in a Coffin and these things are just impossible.
I don't know how parents can do it even, and I'll meet them, and we have a particular Colonel. That's all he does. So good, so professional, and that's what he does. He said I greet the dead, sir. I greet the dead, and what happens is, this big incredible machine flies in, this tremendous cargo plane, and it flies in, so powerful, so big, and I'll be talking to some of the parents and they'll act like they're fine.
I said how are you doing? We're fine, sir. We're fine. We're really good. I say that's great and I'll tell the Colonel and say, Colonel, I think you're doing great. No, sir. They're not going to do great you'll see, and I didn't know what he was talking about. This is the first time and then we went outside to the runway and this incredible machine is flying in and it lands and it comes over and it pulls up and we have military guards.
We have incredible, talented musicians that do this, that's what they do. And what happens is that door opens up and the Colonel told me, he said, sir, when that door opens, those same people that you think are OK do things that you'll never see, you'll hear sounds like you've never heard. That's what he does and I saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it. The door is open and these beautiful soldiers, five or six on each side, lifting the coffin and walking down the runway, the plank, they call it, off this cargo plane, and I see parents make sounds that were just 20 minutes ago.
Absolutely fine, make sounds, scream and cry like you've never seen before. The Colonel was telling me that, sir, you'll see things that you've never seen before. A mother who was fine 20 minutes ago, you think, breaking the military line and jumping off and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter, jumping on, on top of the flowers on top of the American flag.
I've seen this and then I have all these people that want to stay. They want to stay and I don't want to stay. We were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days. We've now been there for 10 years. We were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time, we're now going to be there for close to 19 years, it's time to bring them home.
It's time to bring them home. It's true. It's time to bring them home. We've done our job. We've defeated everyone that we're supposed to defeat, and now we are, we are now policing. We are now policing. That's what we're doing we're policing and that, as I said, no more respect for the police, but these are military people and those are police.
But we are now policing. We're not fighting, we're policing, and you know what, after all of these years, and one other story, and I have to tell you. I go to Walter Reed on Friday and I do it quite often. I gave out five Purple Hearts and I meet people that are so beautiful, so amazing. I met five warriors and one was so badly hurt with a loss of arms and a leg.
Another one -- they're just very, very devastated but these are great, great people, and I gave out the Purple Heart. I see the parents and I have to say, Walter Reed, I wanted to say the doctors there, the job they do. You know you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets and the vets care and nobody's done better.
We got choice for the vets. We did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible but I saw these young men and I gave them their Purple Hearts and their parents were there crying. And one of them was so amazing, I said what's your problem, sir? My face was blown apart. My nose was absolutely just blown apart.
He said, sir, it's incredible and I looked at him. I said that's the most beautiful nose I've ever seen. What do you mean? He said a doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field. He said there were a thousand fragments. Now I don't know if that's right but, well, a lot, he meant a lot. He said there were a thousand fragments.
He rebuilt my nose with glue, he glued the bones together. He rebuilt my nose. I say you have the most beautiful nose I've ever seen and it's true. And his father came over to me, he said, sir, father was crying. He said, sir, honestly, my son looks better now. He said my son did not have a good looking nose.
Now look at it, it's beautiful, it's beautiful. But these doctors at Walter Reed and these Army and Marine and medical doctors. They are unbelievably great people and they see sights that you and I hopefully will never see. They see things that nobody will ever see and there's nobody like them and I have to give a shout out to those people.
There's nobody like -- So, in the case of Turkey and Syria and the Kurds, we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with Turkey. [Unidentified] No, you don't want to do that. We could hit Turkey very hard financially or we could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds. I like that, you know, let's mediate a deal but remember, they've been fighting each other for hundreds of years, and we were artificially put there, in this case, by President Obama.
So we did our job. We knocked out and I'll tell you another thing. We have to be treated fairly. We have to be treated fairly. We're not treated fairly by other nations. We captured many, many ISIS fighters, most of them came from Europe. They came from Germany, they came from France and came from all of these countries and we called them.
I call them myself in many cases, I said, take your fighters, they said we don't want them, you take them. I said no, no, no, we did you a big favor. They're citizens of Germany, they're citizens of France, they're citizens of these various countries in Europe, take your fighters. We don't want them, sir.
We don't want them. And I said, how unfair are we treated? We do them a great favor and they won't take the fighters. So we're doing some things that are pretty amazing and every once in a while you have to change course and do what you have to do. The United States has spent $8 trillion in the Middle East.
We've lost thousands of brave soldiers and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people, great people, their lives will never be the same. These wars produced only chaos and bloodshed and all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed, made the Middle East less safe, it's really -- it's less safe. It's less stable and it's less secure, and I say it all the time.
The single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going into the quicksand of the Middle East. We spent $8 trillion and lost thousands of lives, and by the way, the other side, we can talk about that lost millions of lives. What did we do? So we're going to pull them out and we're pulling people out.
We're trying to make good deals and we're going to bring our soldiers back home, and we may need them for something else, and they'll be ready. Previous administration's lust for regime change and also put historic Christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started. They are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures, the Christians, the Christians, and we work hard with the Christians.
We have tremendous evangelical support. We work hard with them. So we're slowly getting out of the Middle East, doing it carefully, and we're rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before. When I came into office, a very prominent General told me because it looked like we could have a big conflict with some.
He said, sir, we have no ammunition, we had all planes, we had planes that were so old, they didn't fly. We had people going to the desert, the plane graveyards, airplane graveyards, picking up parts. I'd never want to hear a President of the United States hear those words again. I never want to have a President hear the words, sir, we have no ammunition.
Think of that. Think of that. Now thanks to more than $2.5 trillion worth of investment in our military, we have more ammunition, more missiles, more rockets, more tanks, more fighter jets, and more of everything else that we've ever had before. And we have no choice. When you look around the world we have no choice, unfortunately.
And the Democrats wanted to dismantle our military. After years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country. That's what we have to do. We're replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. USMCA, a giant victory for our farmers, ranchers, workers in Minnesota.
Congress should pass the USMCA immediately. We hope that Nancy Pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about some nonsense. And to protect our industrial backbone, I placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel, and I'm also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from China and the supply chain of China, which was unbreakable, is now breaking wide open.
And they understood it, and I don't blame China for what's taken place over the last 25 years, I blame the people that led our country, that let that happen, where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build China. Not China's fault. In the previous administration, they put our nation's natural resources under lock and key, including thousands and thousands of acres in a place called Superior National Forest.
Last year, I traveled to Duluth and announced that we would be ending this injustice, reopening Superior National Forest, and restoring mineral exploration for the iron ore mines of Minnesota, tremendous job. And now the Iron Range is back in business and the last time I was here, a man came up to me and said, sir, President Obama took our heart away, took our life away.
I'll, never forget it. A man, strong guy, had tears in his eyes. He said you gave us back our life because they took it away from them. We gave it back. Best iron ore there is anywhere. My administration is also fighting the Democrats, Socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate Medicare. Republicans will protect Medicare and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.
And for those of you that have private healthcare, health insurance, 180 million people, they are going to end it, obliterate it, and most people are thrilled with it. We are going to leave it. You're going to have your plan the way you want it and there's no plan like those. Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up to the moment of birth.
And that is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion socialism, and blatant Washington corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it's the party of the American dream.
For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Do you remember that? Gee, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Now you have a President who is standing up for America, we are standing up for Minneapolis, and we are standing up for the great state of Minnesota. We begin this political campaign with the best record, the best results, the press agenda, and the only positive vision for America.
We begin this campaign with right now, almost three years of perhaps the most successful administration in the history of our country. Together, we will help millions more citizens from welfare to work, from the pendants to independence and from poverty to prosperity. With your help, we will re-elect and we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration.
We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years. Nobody thought that could be done.
It's going to be done. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement.
We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our great national motto: In God we Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history.
Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put a man on the face of the moon. Proud citizens like the people of Minnesota helped build this country and together we are taking back our country.
We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Minnesota, I will tell you this with great certainty. The best is yet to come. [Audience chants "Four more years"] Thank you very much. And just in concluding, together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again.
We will make America safe again. And we will Make America Great Again. Thank you, Minnesota. Thank you.
I love these hangars. I love a hangar. There's nothing like a hangar. You get out of the plane, you walk over, and we have massive crowds. We don't have to turn so many away, but there are a lot of people still trying to get. Should we wait or should we start right now? Start? We start. This is a great crowd.
Oh, Montana to me is a very big and powerful state, I can tell you that. At least it will be after Matt Rosendale becomes your senator. He's great. But I'm thrilled to be here in Montana with thousands of loyal, hard-working, incredible American patriots... Hard to believe I'm saying this, because it was an incredible time, less than two years ago, but almost two years ago, right?
That was some day, that was some evening, that was some period. That was a movement like we've never, ever seen before. And here we are again. It's going to be like -- doesn't seem long, but it flies. You know, when you're having a good time, and when you're doing a good job, time flies, right? Time flies.
And in just 19 days, the people of this incredible state are going to send Matt Rosendale to the U.S. Senate to protect your jobs and protect your Second Amendment, which is under siege. This, I would think, is a very big Second Amendment place. I wouldn't want to be the one that walks into your house and says, "Give me that gun." Right?
Nobody has the courage to do that. But Matt is going to protect your Second Amendment. And he's going to defend your borders, and we're doing a good job on those borders with the worst laws you've ever seen. And we are making America great again together. Really are. This is truly an incredible time for our country.
The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years. Think about it. More Americans are now working than ever before. Here in Montana, household incomes have reached an all-time high. Think of that. Think of that. And we watch Montana. We watch your miners. We watch your loggers, your ranchers, your farmers.
We watch Montana. And, you know, two years ago, you watched over me, because we won this state by a lot. Right? That was one of those quickies. I love those states. You know, the polls close. Polls have just closed in the state of Montana. Trump has won Montana. You know, it's like... They say it, because when it's that big, they announce it within seconds.
We like the -- we like the -- it's just a flowing. They do comma. They don't do -- they do a comma. Trump has won Montana. But you've been great to me. We're also taking care of your veterans. You have a lot of veterans in Montana. And our military -- you know, we've rebuilt and are rebuilding our military.
We'll soon be more powerful than ever before. And hopefully we won't have to use it. But there's something about having it. All of a sudden, they say, OK, let's forget about that. That's the way life works, isn't it? We're going to have the most powerful military by far that we've ever had. And a lot of it's already coming, those brand-new, beautiful planes, those incredible stealth F-35s, the -- you have the F-35, you have the F-18s, the Super Dupers, the Hornets.
We have them all. We've got them coming left and right, and you know the great thing? There's nothing more important than the military, but we build them all right here in the USA. We don't send them to other countries to be built. We build them right here. We have the best military equipment in the world.
We build the best. There's nothing even close. Best missiles, best planes, best ships, best everything. We build them here, and there's nothing like best submarines. Submarines, we're so far ahead of everybody, forget it. Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, and America is winning, because we are finally putting America first again.
It's America first. You know that. We're putting America first. You haven't heard that for a long time, for many, many decades, you haven't heard. Just last week, we achieved another historic victory for the American people. In a beautiful ceremony at the White House, we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
And those Democrats treated him badly. Very unfair. That was an unfair deal. From the second the Supreme Court vacancy opened, Democrats were on a heartless campaign of political and personal destruction. It was disgraceful. Before he was even chosen, before I even knew who I was going to pick, they were saying horrible things about my candidate.
I said, I haven't picked anyone yet. They're great people. That was terrible. What they did was terrible. And what they did to Brett Kavanaugh and his beautiful family is a national disgrace that will not be soon forgotten. Remember that. And come Election Day, Americans will remember Kavanaugh and they will remember all sorts of other things, because that was a shameful act.
And there are many other shameful acts, including what they're doing to our border by saying we're not going to give you the laws that you need to protect our country. But we're taking it, and we're doing it, and we have great things happening. This will be an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, and common sense.
That's what it's going to be. It's going to be an election of those things, law and order, Kavanaugh, you remember commonsense, and remember it's going to be an election of the caravan. You know what I'm talking about. You know what I'm talking about. And now we're starting to find out -- and I won't say it 100 percent -- I'll put a little tiny question mark at the end -- but we're probably not going to need it, but we have the fake news back there.
Fake news. But a lot of money has been passing to people to come up and try and get to the border by Election Day, because they think that's a negative for us. Number one, they're being stopped. And number two, regardless, that's our issue. So this is the problem with them. They have one thing. They stick together.
They vote together. They're bad politicians. They have horrible policy. They hate ICE. They don't like our military. They don't like our vets. They're always fighting us on that. They have lousy policy. The one thing, they stick together, but they wanted that caravan and there are those that say that caravan didn't just happen.
It didn't just happen. A lot of reasons that caravan, 4,000 people. But I just want to thank the Mexican government, because they're stopping it hopefully before it ever gets to Mexico. As you know, I am willing to send the military to defend our southern border, if necessary. All because of the illegal immigration onslaught brought by the Democrats, because they refuse to acknowledge or to change the laws.
They like it. They also figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat. You know. Hey, they're not so stupid, when you think about it, right? But they are crazy. And the crazy Democrats refuse to support any form of border security legislation to fix our absolutely horrible, old-fashioned, loophole-ridden immigration laws.
We have the worst laws anywhere in the world. We have the dumbest laws anywhere in the world. Somebody comes in and we say, excuse me, a foot hits the ground. You know, if a foot hits the ground, we're not allowed to say, hey, go back. Every other country in the world, they say go back. Can't come in. Sorry.
A foot hits the ground, we have to by law, with these horrible people that are making their own rulings, having nothing to do with our Constitution, we have to take those people in, even if they're, criminals and we have hardened criminals coming in. You think those people are perfect? They're not perfect.
You have some hardened, bad people coming in. And by law we have to take their name, and then we have to release. It's called catch and release. You ever hear of this one? You catch them, you find out about them. Even if you find out bad things, you catch them and you release them. And then you say, come back for a court case.
There's only a problem. There's not enough judges in the world to take care of it. And I will say, I have caused the problem. I'm taking full blame. You know why? Everyone's like in shock. It's my -- hey, look, fake news, it's my problem. I caused it. Because I have created such an incredible economy, I have created so many jobs.
I have made this country with you so great that everybody wants to come in. So they're all pouring in, or trying to. So with the worst laws in the world, we're doing a hell of a job. But we've made our country strong. We've made our country respected and people want to come in. Most importantly, what we have to do, we need votes, meaning we need Republicans to vote.
You know, you keep hearing we have a majority. We have a majority that if somebody has a cold, if somebody's not feeling well, we lose our majority. That's how it is. It's not -- we have like almost -- like identical. We have to have more votes so we can put in strong, conservative Republican, but commonsense.
It's not even Republican -- it's commonsense policies. Commonsense. That's why we have a lot of Democrats that support us, frankly, we have a lot of the Democrats that aren't crazy. They have intelligence. Because the Democrat Party has gone so far left that nobody knows what to do. It's become radical resistance.
You ever see their signs? Resist. They say, what are you going to resist? I don't know. Do you ever see when the fake news interviews them? And then they try and cut it, but they -- they'll go to a person holding a sign who gets paid by Soros or somebody, right? That's what happens. Well, did you see with -- with now Justice Kavanaugh, did you see -- and, by the way, also, with Justice Neil Gorsuch.
How good is he? That's a great two people. But did you see the signs? They're brand-new. They're beautiful, the black-and-white signs. Everybody has the same size, right from the finest printer in Washington. Do you think the people -- those are not signs made in the basement. They were all identical. And I pointed that out, and the next day everybody had signs that looked like they were made in the basement.
[Laughter] I didn't see any of the black and white ones. It's a whole -- hey, look, there's a lot of rigged things going on in this country, you know about that. There are a lot of rigged things going on. Just ask Bernie Sanders. You think things are rigged, Bernie? Do you think things are rigged, Bernie?
You could ask me, too. I could tell you about rigging, I'll tell you what. But we fight like nobody ever fought before. You know, we do -- we fight, and we fight, and we win, and we fight harder than anybody ever fought. And then they say, oh, it's obstruction. It's -- if you fight back today, it's called obstruction.
No, no, no. We fight back. Call it whatever the hell you want. We fight back. Obstruction. You know, I just walked in, and a big, strong guy grabbed me. And he was almost crying. It happens every time. And many times. And he said, sir, Mr. President, thank you so much for saving our country. And, you know, now I've -- I hear it all the time, those exact words.
Thank you for saving our country. And at first I had to think about it, months ago. I really had to think about it. You see what we did with taxes. Forget taxes, with so many things, more important than taxes, although those big tax cuts, they did come in handy, didn't they? Everybody benefited from that.
But regulations -- so many things, you add it all up, and they say thank you very much, Mr. President, for saving our country. Well, the truth is, we have all together -- because this has been a movement like we've never seen before in this country, like probably almost every country they've never seen a movement like what happened with us in 2016. And we all together -- not me. I'm a spokesperson.
By the way, how have I done? Have I done OK? I was speaking to a big politician the other day. It was sort of funny. And he was great. He's a great guy. But he was trying to make a point. He wanted me to do something a certain way. He said, sir, I have won five elections. I've run eight times. So I've won, sir, five -- I know what I'm doing.
I'm a professional. I've been doing this for a long time. So think of it. He's -- he runs eight times. Sir, I won five elections. I said, well, you got me there. I ran once, and I won one election, but it's the presidency, right? That's right. The presidency. It's the presidency. That's -- think of it. We're one for one.
We're going to soon be two for two, and that's going to be it. Although a lot of the fake news said that he's not going to stop at eight years. He's going longer. We'll never take it away from him. This is, like, the group of people -- first they say he doesn't know what he's doing. Perhaps he's incompetent.
He doesn't know what he's doing. It's terrible, et cetera. Then, two minutes later, they say he's going -- for eight years, he's going to take it for long -- you can't have both. You can only go one way or the other. You can't do both. No, eight years is going to be fine, right? Eight years, it's going to be fine.
It's all the time we need. That's all the time we need to make America great again. Make America great again. Is that -- is that maybe the greatest slogan in the history of runs? You remember Hillary's slogan? It was the worst slogan. She paid like a million dollars for some guy to make the slogan. And after I dissected it at one speech, they changed it the next day.
[Laughter] Come together or some -- something terrible. Come together. Oh, she's a great unifier. Right. Great unifier. Crooked Hillary is a great unifier. [Audience chants Lock her up] It is incredible the deep state where they don't even look at her. Isn't it incredible? Think of it, 33,000 e-mails, she gets a subpoena from the United States Congress.
Forget about all the other things, forget about -- and you can never forget about Benghazi, ever. But forget about everything else. Never forget Benghazi. But forget about all the other things. Thirty-three thousand e-mails, she gets a subpoena, not like a subpoena from you or you or that young person right back there.
A subpoena from the United States Congress. She gets it. Then she deletes 33,000 e-mails. And she acid-washes -- she acid-washes -- this way, it's a very expensive process, never used, it's never used, because it costs so much. It's called acid-washing. It's called bleach -- it's called five different names.
But I like acid-washing, because that really says it. She acid-washes 33,000, so that nobody can ever find -- but they're around someplace. I think that maybe -- maybe they're at the State Department. The State Department -- we have a great man now at the State Department, Mike Pompeo. But maybe they're at the State Department.
They could very well be at the Department of Justice, if you can believe that whole deal. But we're just being quiet. We're being quiet. Do you know why? There's been no collusion. Can you imagine -- think of this -- I was on the plane before, I told somebody -- let's say we're losing the state of Montana.
That will never happen. And I get an urgent call from my people in Montana. And I'm in New York or I'm in Washington. And they say sir, sir, we're losing the state of Montana. Is there anything you can do? Can you imagine me saying, oh, I don't know what to do, gee, let's call the Russians, maybe they could help?
Can you believe -- no, can you believe the stupidity of this? Let's call the Russians? [Laughter] If I ever called the Russians, the first one to know about it would be the state of Montana, and they wouldn't be too happy. Can you imagine? Let's call the Russians? It's a disgrace. It was an excuse made by the Democrats for losing an election that, frankly, they should win, because the Electoral College -- remember, I couldn't get 270. There was no way to 270, you need 270. There was no -- I went to -- that's exactly right, 306. I went -- that's right, you heard.
How many times you hear -- there is no way? So I went to Maine, I love Maine, by the way, one vote. Got one. One. So I went to Maine four or five times. I love the people of Maine. And I ended up winning that one, but I didn't need it, because we won Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and a lot of states.
And a lot of states. No, I'll tell you what, it was an exciting -- it was an exciting time. And next time, Democrats are going to learn where they have to run. You got to run in the right places. These were not great competitors, but they were fun. Actually, they were more effective, in my opinion, after the election than before the election.
Does that make any sense? You know, that to me makes a lot of sense. Wiseguys. The Democrats have turned -- I love you, too. Who said that? Who said that? Who said that? It's finally a woman. You know, I get it from the men all the time. [Laughter] And so far, every guy that said I love you, they're just not my type.
[Laughter] I finally heard it from a woman. Thank you. Thank you. And look at all the women for Trump signs. Here we go again. It's the same thing. Everyone says, but will he get the women? There are -- you know, these fakes on television, the pundits, you know, real geniuses, they'd really done well in predicting me. He's never going to run.
He has too good a life. He's just doing it for fun. He'll never run, but he's having a good time. I said, that's a good time? So I ran. Then September, one by one, we knock them off, knock them off, knock them off, remember? Eighteen people, 17 opponents, very talented opponents, in many cases, not in all cases.
But in many cases. I remember Charles Krauthammer. And he was talking... Go ahead. Well, he treated you better than he treated me. That's OK. But he was talking about the field. I hadn't entered. And he said, why would he do this? This is the single greatest field of Republicans ever assembled for an election.
And I looked at my wife -- by the way, how good is our first lady? Good? Is she doing great? People love our first lady. Look at all the signs. We love our first lady. We love our first lady. Just came back from Africa. Just came back from Africa. And she got great -- people thought it -- she -- they love her.
They -- she went into areas that -- it was such sad because such poverty. She went in with her arms wide open. And the New York Times and some others, all they could talk about -- she wore a certain that. And they said it represented a colonialization. And everybody was trying to figure -- and I think it came out of Los Angeles.
I think they actually bought it at Los Angeles, which is such a -- but they love the job she's doing. And yesterday they had a problem, right? You saw that. Fire on the plane. And I get a call. Sir, your wife is up in the air. There's a fire on the plane. I said, don't tell me that. Don't tell me. And they came down quickly.
Great, great people, great pilots, great pilots. And she was cool. She was cool. I did have to -- once I found out everything, I asked, how was she? Was she scared? No, sir. What was she like? She was so cool, we couldn't believe it. Everybody else had cloth on their face, and I probably would have, also, cloth that was water, right, wet, on their face.
She sat there, hey, what else is new? That's the way she is. She's a great first lady. She's doing an incredible job. And you think it's easy for her to be a first lady, not so easy. She's done an incredible job. But Charles Krauthammer -- so he said -- oh, he said there's never been a field like this. And I actually went to my wife, I said, you know, a very smart man just said there's never been a field so talented as this.
But one by one -- and they are -- and now a lot of them are friends of mine, almost all of them are friends of mine. You know, you go through wars together and then -- if you're smart, and if they're smart, you get along. I have great relationships. Ted Cruz has become a friend of mine. He's doing great in Texas.
Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, he was in there at the beginning. Remember he got up and he said I don't know what you guys are wasting your time for. Nobody is going to beat Trump. Why are you doing this? You can't beat him. In fact, do you remember, he said, in fact, I just went out and bought a Trump and I'm dropping out after this debate, but none of you guys are going to beat Trump.
That was Mike Huckabee. That was pretty cool. That was pretty cool. It was very good for my ego. In fact that might have been my worst debate because I was so impressed with what he said, I didn't think about anything. No, Mike is great. We have -- we had such great people. We had such great people. And a lot of talented people.
And the end result is this is where we are. And we're doing a lot of good. The Democrats have truly turned into an angry mob, bent on destroying anything or anyone in their path. And your senator is one of them. Let me tell you, your senator is disgraceful what he did. This election you will decide which party is in control of Congress.
That's true. And if they win, even if they win the House, it's going to be just fighting, fighting, fighting. It's going to be -- we'll be -- you love my hair? Thank you. [Laughter] She knows what to say. She knows how to make me happy. "I love your hair." [Laughter] Well, the one thing that has been really great about this whole endeavor, they used to say, he wears a hairpiece, he wears a hair -- they don't say that anymore.
These people have seen me under every condition known to man. I haven't heard that one in over a year. You know, when you're walking around and the wind is going crazy and you're inspecting, like I did the other day, the incredible hurricane, the horrible Hurricane Michael that devastated Florida and Georgia and Alabama got hit hard.
And then a couple of weeks before, and Michael got a piece of them, too. But a couple of weeks before, I went to North Carolina, South Carolina. You look at what happened in a little piece of Virginia. And you walk around in those conditions, you can't fake it. You can't fake it. So that's one good thing.
Nobody ever says that anymore. That's one of the -- might be one of the best things that's happened to me in a long time. [Laughter] Because my whole life, they said, is it or isn't it? Barbara Walters interviewed me. Do you mind if I play with your hair? Do you remember that? And then numerous people have done that.
But that's OK. But the choice could not be more clear. Democrats produce mobs. Republicans produce jobs. It's true. It's true. By the way, this is the most beautiful sky. Well, it's big sky. I guess there's a reason for everything, right? No, it's just -- I got out and I'm looking -- I've been here many times -- but I got out and I'm looking -- I say, that really is big sky.
That's beautiful. It's not only big, it's really beautiful sky. Someday one of you will explain exactly why, but that is a beautiful, beautiful, big sky. But Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer, and the radical Democrats, they want to raise your taxes, they want to impose socialism on our incredible nation, make it Venezuela, because that's what's going to happen... They want to take away your health care, because you won't be able to have it. Our country won't be able to afford it. Destroy your Second Amendment and throw open your borders to deadly drugs and vicious gangs, because plenty of them are coming across, and a lot of drugs.
Democrats have become the party of crime. It's true. Who would believe you could say that and nobody even challenges it? Nobody -- you -- who would believe -- I said -- started a couple of months ago. I said, you know, they've really become the party of crime. I said, I'm going to put that in. I'm going to say that when I make speeches.
Nobody's ever challenged it. Maybe they have. Who knows? I have to always say that, because then they'll say they did actually challenge it, and they'll put like -- then they'll say he gets a Pinocchio. So maybe they did challenge it, but not very much. It's become really -- they have become the party of crime because of what they do. They would rather devastate American communities than defend America's borders.
The Democrat Party has become too extreme to be trusted with power. Their radical policies are a danger to your family and to your country. If you want to drain the swamp, you must defeat the Democrats and you must defeat Senator Jon Tester. I mean, he's a super liberal. How do you -- I know you people. I won by a fortune of votes, right, like many, many, many votes.
And I know you. You know me. I know you. How the hell did you ever elect that guy? How did you pull that off? So we're thrilled to be joined tonight by somebody who's been working with me and an incredible guy, a great human being, and a very talented senator, but somebody that loves you and he loves the country, Senator Steve Daines.
Steve? Where is he? He is a great guy. Tell you what, he is -- you know the strong, silent type? They're the ones I like the best. I want to be that way someday. [Laughter] No, Steve Daines has been -- he's been a great representative. He loves this state. I also want you to go and vote for an incredible Montana leader, somebody that's gone to Congress, and in a short period of time, one of the most respected people in Congress, Greg Gianforte.
Hey, Greg, come up. Come up, Greg.
Let me just say, on behalf of all of Montana, Mr. President, thank you for giving us hope again.
He's so smart. You know, we've had people -- you're on live television all over the place, and we've had people get up, speak for 20, 25 minutes. And these guys are going crazy, that's not the deal. But Greg is smart. And by the way, never wrestle him. You understand that? Never. [Laughter] Any guy that can do a body slam, he's my kind of... He was my guy.
I shouldn't say this, because -- there's nothing to be embarrassed about. So I was in Rome with a lot of the leaders from other countries talking about all sorts of things, and I heard about it. And we endorsed Greg very early, but I had heard that he body-slammed a reporter. And he was way up. And he was way up. And I said, oh, this was like the day of the election, or just before, and I said, oh, this is terrible, he's going to lose the election.
Then I said, well, wait a minute, I know Montana pretty well. I think it might help him. And it did! No, he's a great guy. Tough cookie. Greg's opponent, Kathleen Williams... is a radical far-left Democrat. She's going to be voting with Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, the great Maxine Waters. That's another beauty, isn't it? Williams wants to massively raise your taxes, and she supports Pelosi's cap-and-trade tax, which is a disaster, and it would kill the Montana coal industry that we all rebuilt together in a very short period of time.
Any miners in the audience, please? How are you guys? Happy, right? Better believe it. It's coming back. Clean coal. I say beautiful, clean coal. And we have more of it than anybody. And Kathleen Williams supports open borders. She opposes the wall, which we've started and we've done a lot of work on it, but I'd like to get it done quickly.
Give us the money and we'll do it fast, but we've started it. We got $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.6 billion. And I want to get it finished. We need it now. And, by the way, if this scene -- if this scene of people pouring up -- if that doesn't make people want to build -- you know, in 2006, all these people -- just about all them -- they wanted a wall.
They know it's the right thing. They just don't want to give us the victory. It's not like Schumer says, oh, gee, you have it -- Israel has a wall. Bibi Netanyahu -- think of it. He said it worked 99.9 percent, their wall. They have a big wall. It's in the form of a very tough fence. But they have a wall.
And Schumer knows this. And Nancy Pelosi knows this. But they just don't want to give us the victory. I know for a fact, they said, you know what, we can't let them have the wall because that would be another campaign promise fulfilled. But I've done so many campaign -- I'm so far ahead. But -- but we've started the wall.
And it's moving. And we're going to get it, but get me some Republican votes, please. Williams voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities and she voted in favor of giving public benefits to illegal aliens. Oh, that's a beauty. Do the people of Montana like the idea of giving public benefits to illegals? I don't think so. I don't think so. I know you very well.
My son is here all the time, Don. He's a big fan. He's a hunter. He's a hunter. Big fan of Greg's. Big fan of Greg's. He's a good hunter, that one. You people can't believe it. He grew up in a certain nice location in New York, like Fifth Avenue. He knows more about hunting and guns and rifles than maybe anybody here.
That's the crazy thing. That's what he loves. A few people over there say I disagree with that, but he does know it. Greg will tell you that. But everybody has to go out and vote for Greg. And finally, it is my great honor to introduce the next United States senator from Montana, Matt Rosendale. Come on up, Matt.
Come on up. Great guy. Big success. Highly respected. [Audience chants USA]
Good evening, Montana. President Trump is making history again here in Montana, by golly. This is his third trip to Montana, and that does set a record. This is one for the history books again. I want to take a moment to thank our veterans and all of our military for their great service to our great nation.
You kept your promises, and I will work tirelessly every day to make good on the promises that our nation made to you. Mr. President, thank you for your support and for keeping your promises to the people of Montana. You are making America great again. And if we want to keep America great, then we need everyone here to get out and vote.
President Trump and all of his policies are on the line. So let's make history and retire Jon Tester and send President Trump the help he needs. Let's remember, it was Jon Tester who cast the deciding vote on Obamacare and got your premiums skyrocketing. I will never give up on repealing and replacing Obamacare.
We must have health care that we can actually afford. And I will make sure to always protect those with pre-existing conditions. Remember, when Jon Tester talks about supporting the Second Amendment, understand that he voted for liberal judges who will take your guns away. I'm endorsed by the NRA with an A rating.
And all Jon Tester could muster up was a D. That record speaks for itself. Jon Tester does not stand with us on border security. He supports amnesty, catch and release, and sanctuary cities. Well, I'm running to help our president secure the border, deport the criminals and sanctuary cities, and build that wall.
I like the wall. [Audience Chants Build the wall] We're going to build it. President Trump deserves a senator from Montana that will support his Supreme Court nominees, not oppose them 100 percent of the time like Jon Tester has done. No thanks to Jon Tester, we now have two good men and two great judges on the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
Folks, Jon Tester has been too wrong for too long. We can't let Jon Tester and the radical, liberal resistance win this November. If they win, they'll go after President Trump and his agenda. We can't let that happen. We need everyone in this hangar and across the state to get up and do their part to win the race.
Ballots have dropped. I encourage everyone to please cast your vote and to turn them in as soon as possible. Tell your friends, your family, and your neighbors to get out and vote. I pledge to always put Montana first. And I will stand in strong support of President Trump, because the work that he's doing really is making America great again.
Thank you, Montana. Thank you, President Trump. May God bless each and every one of you and these great United States of America.
Thank you. [Audience Chants USA] Thank you, Matt. And I have to say: A vote for Tester is a vote that really is going to count. It's going to count for you. He's replacing far-left with common sense. And we really have to get out. We are looking to have some success, where right now it's so impossible. We have to get Schumer and Pelosi, we have to move them around, we have to get them out.
Our new star, Maxine, we have to get them out. There's a lot of bad things happening. I don't know, you know, you see what they do, you see what they think, and you almost say, like, can it really be possible? Can somebody not care about our military? Can somebody not care about so many other things that we're doing, like taking care of our vets?
I mean, can somebody not care about tax cuts? They want to raise your taxes and they don't care about crime. Think of that. Raise your taxes and they don't care about crime. Is that really some way to get elected? How do you do that? I would never be a politician if that were my platform, I tell you. Certainly I wouldn't be successful.
But Tester says one things to voters and then always does the exact opposite. In Washington, he talks like he's from Montana and he votes like he's Nancy Pelosi. The only thing keeping Tester's campaign alive are millions and millions and millions of dollars from outside liberals and radical leftists who couldn't care less about Montana.
They don't know anything about Montana. All they know is he's a vote for them. They don't know anything. They didn't come up here to talk to you. They just send a lot of money. It's crazy. Tester voted against tax cuts for Montana families, where you benefited so much. I know how important that's been. And he voted for Obama's job-killing regulations.
With those regulations, all of your energy that you take out of the ground in the cleanest way, and that makes our nation wealthy, you couldn't do it. You wouldn't be allowed to do it. All of the miners that are here, all of the people that are here, all of the steelworkers, you wouldn't have your jobs back.
You wouldn't have jobs. We were going in the wrong direction. When I came in, we were going down. And now we just hit 4.2 percent, and everyone is saying, how did that happen, right? GDP, 4.2 percent. And on immigration, Tester's record can be summarized in two simple words: Open borders. Open borders. Think about it. Think about it. How about this guy in California?
I have to say, look, I'm sure he's a nice guy, nice guy, young guy, they say, oh, someday he wants to be president. Oh, please let him run. But how about this guy? Running for governor, California. He wants open borders, and he wants to take care of everyone's health care, everyone's medical costs, right?
He wants to put more gas taxes on, where they just have a lot. But he wants to take care of everybody. So open borders, the whole world is going to go to California. And they owe about 15 zillion dollars. They owe more money than anybody knows, it's not even possible for them. And he's asking everybody in the world, just come on in. Open borders, we're going to take care of your health care.
We're going to take care of your schools. We're going to take care of everything. I mean, I mean, give me a break. Right? No, I saw this platform the other day. We have a good candidate there, too. You're right. Thank you, darling. We have a good candidate there. He's -- now, it's hard for a Republican to win in California, because it's become, like, crazy.
But all of a sudden are Republicans making big progress. It's going to be very interesting to see what happens in that race. But that's where Tester is coming from. He voted for amnesty for illegals and against the border wall on numerous occasions. He voted to let drugs in. He voted to let drugs in. That's what you're doing.
You don't have the wall, you don't have a border. What you have is you have infiltration of drugs like you've never seen. We fight so hard. We just had a big victory with the Post Office, so that we can see drugs coming in from China, fentanyl, and other places. Tester voted against Kate's law, legislation to stop criminal illegal aliens from repeatedly breaking into our country.
This guy came in five times, and then you know what happened. Tester voted against enhanced vetting for refugees. I said enhanced vetting, and people said, oh, what a terrible term. I don't think it's terrible. We want to have people come into our country, but they have to come in based on merit, not based on a lottery.
We need people. We need people. Our employment rate's one of the lowest, as I said, over 50 years. We need people to work in the companies. Japan, I was speaking to Prime Minister Abe the other day. They're opening up new car factories and plants in Michigan, in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in Kentucky. At my very strong urging, because we have a massive trade deficit with Japan.
We have a massive trade deficit with everybody. But we're changing it. We made the great deal for your farmers with Canada and with Mexico. And every other business, by the way. And we're not going to have our companies leaving the United States anymore. They're going to stay here, and they're going to expand in our country.
And Tester voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities. He likes sanctuary cities. Jon Tester would rather protect criminal aliens than American citizens, which is why he needs to be voted out of office. He does. And by the way, Matt -- Matt is a really successful guy. Respected by everybody. I know people that knew him from 10 years ago.
Long before he ever thought of this, 20 years ago, just was always a high-end, really respected guy. And he's going to be a great senator for you. He's going to be a great senator, Matt Rosendale. And Matt said, Tester has a D rating from the NRA. I didn't know they gave ratings that low. How can you -- OK, ready?
We're in Montana. How can you have a D rating from the NRA and get votes? No, no, seriously, did anyone know he had a D rating? I saw that, I said, well, that should be the end of that election. You know, there are some places you can have a D rating, I guess. But he has a D rating in Montana? I don't think that's going to last long.
And he voted for liberal Obama judges who want to take away your Second Amendment. They do want to take it away. Just in case you haven't figured that one out, that's a tough one. And one of the things that will be happening -- you know, you're happy that we have two great Supreme Court justices that we just put on. You know, presidents go a long time, they never have a judge.
I've had two, and it's not even two years, think of that. So think of that. But under scenarios, we could have two more, three more, maybe four more. I wish everybody great health, I do. I really do. But, you know, we could have a scenario where we have more. That's why you have to be careful, because you think the two is good.
That could get overwritten very quickly. You think you're looking good, but -- and you are, but, frankly, it can be overridden very quickly. Jon Tester joined the shameful Democrat mob. They were calling it a mob. Now, a lot of people are calling -- these people are starting to think of it as a mob. And voted against Kavanaugh, voted against -- I guessed, I didn't even know -- did he vote against Justice Gorsuch?
He did. How do you vote against him? Right? Top student at Harvard. Top student at Columbia. Top student at Oxford. Oxford. And they vote against him? How do you do that? And he's just, like, led an impeccable life. Justice Kavanaugh, number one in his class at Yale, I mean, these are extraordinary people.
And they had a great life. Look, it's not about grades or marks or -- it's one thing. But these people have led incredible lives. And in the case especially of Justice Kavanaugh, the lies that were made up, the stories that came out, and he didn't -- he honestly -- I'm pretty good at this stuff -- he honestly never heard of this stuff.
He never heard of it. It was a big con job. You've heard me say that. It was a con job. See, with me, they're doing con jobs, too, but at least I'm sort of -- that's been my whole life, I've been -- people are -- I expect like things like this. They're given a big, yeah, witch hunt. They're doing a big con job.
But on him, I don't think he was expecting that. When I said -- when I shook his hand, I have to tell you, I've never told this. I shook his hand. And I said, Brett, congratulations, I've chosen you, and I have a list of 23 people or so that are phenomenal, top students, top everything, top judges. All judges, I think.
All judges. Doesn't have to be a judge, by the way, but there's something nice about putting judges on the Supreme Court, right? I don't know. Somehow I think putting a businessman would be nice or a woman. How about a businesswoman? But -- but something nice about -- doesn't have to be a judge, would you believe it? But I shook his hand, I'll never forget it. I shook his hand, and I said, Brett, you're like so good, educationally, you're a great scholar, you're talented, incredible wife, incredible daughters, your life has been amazing.
Don't forget, six checks under the seventh from the FBI, flawless. I said, Brett, congratulations, this is going to be a piece of cake. [Laughter] I meant it. I said, this is going to go so fast. It's going to be so easy. You are perfect. You are something special. And he suffered. He suffered needlessly by vicious people, like Feinstein, like -- remember?
Do you think she leaked? She leaked. She leaked. Remember that? No, I didn't leak, remember? Remember? Senator John Cornyn, great guy from Texas. He asked a question. Did you leak? She was startled, because she was unprepared. No -- no -- did -- what? Did I leak? No, no, we didn't leak, no. No, we didn't leak.
That was the worst body language I think I've ever seen. Remember? Remember Jon Lovitz, the liar, remember Jon Lovitz? Yeah, yeah, I'm a businessman, that's right. I went to -- yeah, yeah, I went to Harvard. Yeah, that's right. I went to Harvard. I'm a businessman. That was, like, a female version of Jon Lovitz.
And then you had Spartacus, right? That's not Spartacus. I know him for a long time. You know, I don't want to speak badly about them, though, because, you know, I want most of these people -- I think all of them -- to get through the process. They're all fighting to run against us. And I don't want to hit them so hard that they don't make it, because maybe they'll find somebody of talent.
So far, there's nobody on the list. So I don't want to kill them. I don't want to do it. It's too early to be doing it. But he didn't do well at Newark, New Jersey. He ran it right the hell into the ground. And that's what he'd do with our country. So you have a lot of them. I'll go over a couple of more names, but, no, I won't. How about -- how about sleepy Joe Biden?
Sleepy Joe? Remember, he challenged me to a fight, and that was fine. And when I said he wouldn't last long, he'd be down faster than Greg would take him down. [Laughter] He'd be down so fast. Remember? Faster than Greg. I'd have to go very fast. I'd have to immediately connect. But -- so he challenges me to a fight, and the fake news said, oh, isn't that cute?
That's so wonderful. Remember, he says he's going to -- he would like to take me behind the barn if he were younger, you know? So he challenges me to a fight. And it's fine. I said he shouldn't do that because I'd take him down so fast. And they said, what a vicious statement made. How vicious. He's talking about fighting.
What a vicious -- do you believe this? That's why it's the fake news. Remember? I responded so nicely. And they made a big deal out of it, but that's OK. And Jon Tester led the Democrat mob in the effort to destroy the reputation of a great man, Admiral Ronny Jackson. Now, Admiral Jackson I got to know well.
He's a doctor, in addition to being an admiral. He's a handsome, wonderful father. His son had just graduated high in his class at Annapolis, incredible young man, beautiful family, incredible wife. And Tester said things about him which were a disgrace. And I say, the people of Montana would not stand for it, what he said about Ronny Jackson.
He was the doctor for President Bush, for President Obama, and for President Trump. And he was high quality. And it's my fault. I said, Admiral, how would you like to head up the V.A.? I want somebody great. You're an admiral, you're a leader. And he's 50 years old. He never had a problem in his whole life.
A little bit like Justice Kavanaugh, you know, really a very fine, high-quality, handsome guy. Never had a problem. And he said, sir, I had never thought of it, but I'll do whatever your wish is, sir. He didn't really want it. He didn't really want. And he might not have been qualified. But here's a doctor at a high level, and he's a man that everybody respected.
I saw that. Respect is so important. And I know he'd do a good job and he's put his heart into it. He's very smart. But he said, sir, if you'd want me to do it -- he really didn't, he was all set, 50 years old. He was going to get a second star, he was going to retire and go into running a big hospital system or something.
He was all set. But he didn't want to disappoint me. So he said, sir, if you'd like me to do it, I will do it. I said, well, I'll tell you what, Ronny, you'll be fantastic. He would have done a great job. And I announced that he was going to be my choice, and he was attacked so viciously, so violently by Jon Tester like I've never seen before.
True. All lies, all made-up stuff. Remember knocking at somebody's door at 2 o'clock in the morning? Remember that? Knocking. And I checked with Secret Service. Did that happen? No, sir, it didn't. They checked it. Sir, that didn't happen. They came in, I want to know. Sir, it didn't happen. Didn't even come close to happening.
I think he wasn't even there. They made up a series of lies that were horrible. And Jon Tester led the group. That's really why I'm here. It's not that we need to vote so badly, I think we're going to do very nicely in the Senate, I hope. I think we should pick up seats. But I have -- first of all, I have a lot of respect for the man that's running, Matt.
But -- but also... Also, I'm here because I can never forget what Jon Tester did to a man that's of the highest quality. You would have loved this man in this state. He'd be one of you. He'd be one of you. And so I said I got to come, I got to come here, I got to help, because what he did was unfair. What he did -- what he did was vicious.
What he did was as they did with Judge Kavanaugh. Same thing. Same thing. Almost -- almost -- if this is believable -- worse. And he sat and he didn't know what hit him. He didn't know what hit him. To which I originally said, welcome to the world of Washington, D.C., isn't this is lovely place? But this was an innocent, wonderful man who's led a life that's incredible, and he was so badly hurt.
And so I had to come here and tell you that story. What happened -- and we've had it checked out so carefully -- and the Secret Service guys are fantastic. And I wanted a full report. I wanted a full report. Doctor Ronny Jackson, special man. Tester doesn't share your values. He shares the values of the Feinsteins and the Cory Bookers, and how about Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren?
You know, the one good thing about her test is that there was so little she had less than the average American. I used to say I have more Indian blood in me than she does and I have none. I used to say that. [Laughter] And I was right. But the only good thing she did, I think she probably disqualified, because she made a fool out of herself.
But I think the only good thing she did, I can't call her Pocahontas anymore. Right? I came up with the name Pocahontas, and they once said you must apologize for that. I said, why? Well, it's not nice what you're doing. I said, OK, I'd like to apologize to the real Pocahontas. But not to the fake -- not to the fake Pocahontas.
Not to the fake Pocahontas. But it's true, she has so little Indian blood. She has none, that I cannot call her Pocahontas anymore. But if you don't mind, I'll continue. Do you mind? Because it'll show everybody what a phony she is. If you vote to elect a Republican House and a Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, raise your income, and make our country great again.
That's happening. We will protect Medicare and Social Security. And Democrats will destroy your Social Security. And they will destroy your Medicare. We will continue confirming judges who interpret the Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border. We will pass Kate's law, stop sanctuary cities, stop catch and release, end visa lottery, end chain migration.
And we will keep the criminal drug dealers and terrorists the hell out of our country. We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependents to independents, and from poverty to prosperity. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. They apologized. Now you have a president who is standing up and proud, but standing up for America.
We are standing up for your values, we are standing up for Montana, and we are proudly standing up for our great national anthem. But to continue this incredible momentum, I need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote for Greg Gianforte and Matt Rosendale.
These are great people. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs, more wealth, and more products made right here, like the old days, in the USA. It is a vote to respect our laws and to respect the heroes of law enforcement. They do a great job. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of hatred and anger and division and to celebrate the greatness and the glory of being American.
Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people, and that's what's happening. That's what happened almost two years ago. This great state was settled by tough pioneer men and even tougher pioneer women. By the way, they keep saying, will he do well with women?
Remember last time? They said the same thing. We did -- we did very well with women. I think I probably won because of women, I hate to tell you, men. Remember? Now they're starting the same thing. It's like a replay. Will he do well? Women, by the way, what do they want? They want security, both real security and economic security.
They don't want to have criminals all over the place. They want to be able to have a great family and raise a great family. They want great education for their family and their kids. I'm the one that gives you that. They don't -- they don't give it to you on the other side, folks. And we're giving you already better choices for health care.
I got rid of the individual mandate, which is the worst thing in Obamacare. And we're running the remnants of Obamacare before it expires completely, and do you notice your premiums are going up less than they've ever gone up? Because we're doing a real job. We had the votes to repeal and replace, and somebody disappointed us a little bit.
But we'll get another shot. I'll tell you what, as Matt said, it'll happen. Get us a couple of votes. But these are pioneer women who braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home and a family. These are great women. The men are, OK, too, not great, but they're OK. The men are OK. What the heck?
The women are exceptional. They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. Right? These courageous Montana patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy our proud, proud, proud American heritage.
Couldn't do it. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. Remember I told you that. I've been telling you that for a long time. We're winning again. Our country is respected again. I can tell you, I meet the leaders of other countries, they say, Mr. President, congratulations.
Do you know that we have the hottest economy, as big as we are? We were going down. We have the hottest economy on Earth. People are moving back in. We're winning again. We're respected again. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in, we will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender.
And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are American and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. You know that. We are one people. We are one family. And we are one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again... and we will make America great again. Thank you, Montana. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Wow, do you have spirit? Hello, Louisiana. Thank you very much. Incredible. What a crowd. And you've got thousands of people outside right now, so, if anybody wants to give up their seat. Thank you very much. So, I'm really thrilled to be back. This has been an incredible state for Trump and it's really incredible.
Do you remember what happened? That wasn't even a close election was it? That wasn't too close. But it's great to be with thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots. That's what you are. And soon, the people of Louisiana will head to the polls. You know I'm really here for a little different reason.
It's called early voting. Do you believe it? That's how much I like Eddie, I'm here for early voting. You know you can go out and vote, I said, well, not a lot of people do that. They say in Louisiana, 40% of the vote is early voting. I said like I said I think I'll come. I'll come. But you're going out to replace a radical Liberal Democrat as your Governor [Audience shouts "Boo"] John Bel Edwards has not done the job.
You're going to have a great new Republican, tremendously successful man, as your Governor, Eddie Rispone. Eddie Rispone. So, early voting is already underway and I think I'm coming back here on Thursday. Do you believe it? I'm doing a double. I'm doing a double. One of your really good anchors just interviewed me, the locals.
Because locals treat me good, the fake news doesn't treat me too good. [Audience shouts "Boo"] But the locals, the locals do. And he said you know, you've been to Louisiana already like four times. I said that's because I happen to like it. If I don't like it, I can't do it. I can't do it. But early voting ends on Saturday, and then, you go out next Saturday and you vote, and I just want you to get out.
Do it early. That way, you can do -- watch your football games. And by the way, by the way, this Saturday, this Saturday, I'm going to be at a certain game. This Saturday, I'm going to be at a certain game. Let's see it's LSU versus a pretty good team from Alabama [Audience shouts "Boo"] And I hear and I'm a football fan.
I hear you have a great quarterback, we're going to see, but I'm actually going to the game. I said that's the game I want to go to. So that'll be -- that'll be tremendous. Two great teams, two great teams that I look forward -- so, I came to get you for early voting for Eddie Rispone. He's going to be a great Governor.
Under Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring, and America is stronger than ever before, and you know it. We're setting new records every day and with the help of Louisiana energy workers, the United States is now -- you know, you have some of the greatest energy and energy workers anywhere in the world, anywhere in the world, anywhere in the world.
The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on planet Earth. And we are supporting law enforcement and we are supporting our police. We're rebuilding our military and you know where all these beautiful new equipment is made? The rockets, the Jets, the ships, everything, it's made in America, don't we love that?
And we're defeating radical Islamic terrorists. We're defeating them. And you saw last week, the monstrous animal known as al Baghdadi is dead. You know, if somebody else did that, they'd be talking about it for months. Me, I got about a day out of it from these people but that's OK, that's OK. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Look at how many they are.
They have a lot of people. They have a lot of people. You know, it is true. I'll say who the greatest hero was, forget about Trump. I'm not, he was -- we did a lot of good work together, the dog was the great hero. Conan, Conan, he's coming to the White House very soon. I said bring him now. They said, sir, he's on a mission.
I said you've got to be kidding. Come on, give him a couple of days rest, please. But no, Conan is coming to the Oval Office very shortly. So, that's good. But our message to these blood-thirsty savages is clear, you don't stand a chance against the righteous might of the United States military. Because America is winning again and America is respected again.
But while we are delivering safety and prosperity for Americans, the radical-left Democrats are trying to rip our nation apart. [Audience shouts "Boo"] They want to eradicate the rule of law, punish religious believers, silence you online, indoctrinate your children, and they're after your Second Amendment.
Don't ever forget it. [Audience shouts "Boo"] They're after your Second Amendment. And with the Republicans, I can tell you one thing, nobody's going to hurt your Second Amendment. Nobody. In their campaign to transform America, Democrats are becoming increasingly totalitarian, suppressing dissent, defaming the innocent, eliminating due process, staging show trials, and trying to overthrow American democracy to impose their socialist agenda.
[Audience shouts "Boo"] Make no mistake, if the Democrats get back in, you will have a depression. The likes of which you've never seen before and you are doing well. How are are 401(k)s is doing by the way? You wouldn't feel at all angry if they went down in half, and then in another year, half of that.
That's what's going to happen. First, it was the Russia hoax, then it was Mueller, remember Mueller, with that hoax. The biggest lie ever foisted upon the American people, OK? But everybody stuck with us. If anything, we became more popular, maybe more popular. I mean last week, Hillary Clinton, crooked Hillary, as we affectionately call her.
[Audience shouts "Boo"] [Audience chants "Lock her up"] So is there any place you would rather be than at a Trump rally on a beautiful, wonderful evening in Louisiana? I don't even know. Would you rather be at LSU versus Alabama or a Trump rally? Let's take the Trump rally. But Democrats must be accountable for their hoaxes and for their crimes.
Now, corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and shifty Adam Schiff, and the crooked media have launched the deranged, delusional, destructive, and hyper-partisan impeachment witch hunt. [Audience shouts "Boo"] Now, we go again except, a lot of things have happened because, you know, I don't know if you saw, I just got off -- I'm coming off the plane and they hand me, look at this guy right there, OK. They just hand me the story, coup has started, whistleblower's attorney said in 2017. Do you know when that was?
That was a long time ago. It's all a hoax. They say January 2017, a coup has started and the impeachment will follow ultimately. It's all -- it's all a hoax. It's a scam. And you know who helps them? These people right back here, the media. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And then it said the lights are going to go out, the CNN light is going to go out.
It said from the lawyer, a sleazeball. It said I predict CNN will play a key role in @realDonaldTrump, not finishing out his first term. Can you believe this? This is a hoax and this was done a long time ago. Then he goes, as one falls two more will take their place, referring to outgoing Trump administration employees.
Who by the way, have been put through hell by this sleazebag there and by crooked politicians. [Audience shouts "Boo"] It just came out. That's the whistleblower. You know the whistleblower? The one that came out with this -- oh, that -- Trump said this and Trump said that. And then, when they heard my real phone call, the whistleblower disappeared.
Shifty Schiff, he's a corrupt politician. Schiff didn't want to have the whistleblower anymore because nobody thought I was going to release the phone call. But as soon as I released the phone call -- and you don't like doing that with a foreign leader because you got to deal with foreign leaders. You don't want them to think -- today I spoke to President Erdogan of Turkey.
[Unidentified] I don't know, is he worried that we're going to release it all over the world because somebody said something that could have been a little bit wrong. You can't do that. You can't do that. Now in this case, I had a perfect phone call, a totally perfect phone call, and -- and you know, anybody that can read -- you saw that on Mark Levin, but the whistleblower before they knew I was going to release, he came out with a whistleblower.
You know, like he's some wonderful person, take a look at the whistleblower. But the whistleblower came out with his horrible statement about this call, so I really had no choice. I said immediately -- talk about transparency. I said release it, release it immediately. And then, the whistleblower saw it and shifty Schiff saw it, he's a total crook.
Schiff saw it, Pelosi saw it, and they said, we've got a problem. We don't want to have anything to do with the whistleblower anymore and the whistleblower disappeared. You know who else disappeared? The second whistleblower. And you know who else disappeared? The informer to the whistleblower if there was such a person, which I doubt, which I doubt.
So here it is. It just came out, just came out, it's a disgrace. I'll tell you what, it's so bad. These people are bad people and it's so bad what they do to our country. They rip the guts out of a country and it's a shame, and they shouldn't be allowed to do it, and people should stop. Maybe go to the Supreme Court, maybe, but they've got to stop it because we have a country to run.
And these people in order to do things, are willing to do illegal acts. It's an illegal act as far as I'm concerned. Last week, the Democrats voted to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of Americans, disgracing themselves and dishonoring their oaths. Now, the good news, the Republicans, were unanimous.
The Republicans finally stood together. They stood together because, you know, the Democrats are lousy politicians, lousy. They have open borders. How do you like having an open border with Mexico? Do you like that? [Audience shouts "Boo"] The Democrats, want open borders, they want sanctuary cities -- you're not too big into sanctuary cities.
With John Bel Edwards, you will soon have a sanctuary city in your midst, but the Democrats -- think of it. They want open borders, which means crime. Now, look at what's going on in Mexico, and I'll tell you what, I have to thank the Mexican government in one way, 27,000 soldiers, but they have other problems.
These cartels are a tremendous problem, we're building and we are building a wall. That wall is going up and it's going up. Our military is now building the wall and it's going up fast. The Army Corps of Engineers and it's going up and it's doing great, it's doing great. It should have been built years ago.
That wall should have been built many years ago, never did. They never could figure it out, but I figured it out. It wasn't easy. I had 100% of the other party fighting me. Do you think that's easy? And you know, we had a majority of a few people, very little, very little. We needed Democrat votes, but we had 100% of the people, and I made one mistake.
I should have said I don't want the wall and the Democrats would have absolutely insisted that I built it. I should have said. You know, five or six years ago, they all wanted the wall. It was only when I came along and I said we've got to build the wall now. You know, you've wanted it but you'd never had the vision or the talent to get it built.
So, we've got to build it. I figured that they'd all join but said they said, no, we don't want the wall anymore. They said no, no, we can have drone tech now. Oh, that's great, people are pouring across, you've got drones flying all over the place. That's great. That's great. No, we should have said we want to -- never build a wall and they would have insisted that it get built immediately.
These are -- I call them now the do-nothing Democrats. We have loopholes that they could solve in 15 minutes. We could sit down, loopholes, catch and release, chain migration. You know, that's when you come in and then everybody you've ever met in the history of the world comes in with you, your mother, your grandfather, your cousin, your brother, your aunt, your uncle, any person that ever met you, come on into our country.
We had a man on the west side highway. I don't even call him a man, I call him an animal. He ran over a lot of people. It turned right going up very, very fast speed where we had this beautiful park in New York City and he killed -- I think eight people. They never talk about the people that lost their legs, that lost their arms, that are permanently disfigured, they never talk about that.
They say eight people were killed. They don't talk about people. These are people that want to keep themselves in shape and they're running and they're running and they're all over, and then, this maniac turns to the right going at an unbelievable speed and he kills people and he horribly injures people and we can't let this happen.
We can't let it happen. These unhinged extremists, the Democrats have been plotting to illegally overturn the election that we won. I didn't win it. We all want it together. They came from all over the place. They came from all over. I mean, you're state isn't that Republican, and yet, we're so far up, but I'll come to see you anyway.
Even -- yeah, you could say, you know, focus on a couple of the closer ones, but we're going to come here anyway and because we do love it. But think of this, 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, the horrible, disgusting Washington Post, which is a terrible paper, it declared the campaign -- this is 19 minutes.
I just taken the office and an article comes out, the campaign to impeach President Trump has begun. Oh, that's nice. Thank you very much. Do you see the reporter over there? Great. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And then during the term, sleepy Joe Biden, who's dumb as a rock said, you fired the guy, you got a billion dollars.
You don't fire the guy, you get nothing and it's on tape, and the press refuses to print it. You talk quid pro quo. You fire that guy, you got to -- you don't fire, you get nothing. Think of that one, OK? That's called quid pro quo, not here. That was said by Joe Biden to get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine, who is looking at his son, who just got thrown out of the Navy, who has paid millions and millions of dollars, even though he had absolutely no energy experience.
In Louisiana, in Louisiana, you wouldn't have hired him and your energy companies. They would have paid to keep him the hell out, OK? He had no experience. Right? How old is your son? How old is that young man there? How old are you? How old -- yeah. Eight. Let me tell you, he's eight. He knows energy better than Joe Biden's son.
Then Biden flies to China. He obviously met with different people than I deal with because we're doing well with China, but I tell you. [Unidentified] But he flies with his father, who is then Vice President, and in 10 minutes, he picks up $1.5 billion for his fund. These are different Chinese people that I've been working with, excuse me. I called up one of the top guys on Wall Street, I said can you do that?
Nope. I've been trying for years. I can't do it. He's like one of the smartest guys in Wall Street. Now, the Democrats are covering up slow, sleepy Joe. And they're trying to steal your vote and silence your voice, and I don't even know because I'm looking at Pocahontas. She's like -- Can you imagine? No, no Pocahontas is starting to emerge from the ashes.
I thought she was gone, we hit her very hard six months ago. I give her credit, she's emerging from the ashes, not a nice person. 1,024th Indian blood -- I have more than she does and I have none. I have none, but I have more than she does. I'd love to have some, I just happen to have none, but I believe I have more than she does.
Generations of American patriots sacrificed everything they had to secure this republic and your sacred right to vote. We will not let the Democrats take that incredible privilege away. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, smears, slanders, and scams. The Democrats, shameful conduct, has created an angry majority, and that's what we are, we're a majority and we're angry.
That we'll vote the do-nothing Democrats out of office in 2020, especially, we're going to take back the House. And we're going to focus hard like those 36 Democrats in Trump areas, areas that I won by a lot. I didn't run in 2018. You know, they keep forgetting. I didn't run. I said go out to vote, go out to vote, but a lot of people said I'm not going to vote until Trump runs.
OK, that's nice. I love those. I love the people. I love -- but they see what we're doing. But I didn't run in 2018, but people forget, we picked up two seats in the Senate. They never want to talk about that. We picked up two seats. They never talk about it. I tried to get them to talk about it, and because of that, what we've done with judges and different appointments, but with your help, we are going to drain the swamp, and that's what we're doing.
Right now, Louisiana can send the radical left a message that they can never ignore. And don't forget in 2016, people came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers and the oceans, they came from all over. The Democrats said what the hell is happening? Where are these people coming from? These were people that were great Americans, worked hard, made a lot of money, much smarter.
You know they call them the elite, we're the elite, we're the elite. I know this. I know this. Speaking for myself, I went to better schools than they did. I went to -- I have nicer houses than they do, I have nicer apartments. I have nicer everything and they're elite. But we're not elite. You people work your asses off.
You're making a lot of money, you're smarter than they are. You're smarter than they are. You're smarter than they are. Antifa, you ever see Antifa? [Audience shouts "Boo"] Do you know what that is? That's the size of their arm. They come in with the black -- oh, they're big tough guys. And then, they start hitting a single reporter, conservative reporter, they start battering with the -- but when the tough guys show up, Antifa says, I think we'll take a pass.
Let's get out of here. No, you're smarter, you're tougher, you're, richer, you got more going, but a lot of people they came up because they didn't like what they were seeing. They didn't want to vote for the people that were running for President. They didn't want to vote for Obama. They didn't want to vote for the people that were running for President.
But when I ran, something happened that was amazing. The lines were, I'll tell you what, in some cases, miles long, and they saw something, they said what is going on? And you know what was going on? Probably the greatest election in the history of our country. It's true. It's your election. I was your spokesman.
I was a person that was able to tell a message, but I'm representing you. And now, these people illegally, through corrupt people like Adam Schiff, that makes up what I said. He gets up in front of the United States Congress and the American people, and he reads my statement, but I didn't say it. He made it up, and then, we called him on it because he never thought that I was going to release the conversation because you just don't do that.
But Ukraine was great, we call them up. Do you mind if we release the conversation? No, we don't. Why? I said don't worry about it, just we're going to release it. You now, thank you very much. And we released it and we caught them in the middle of a giant lie, they're a scam. They're scammers. So, you're going to fire your Liberal Democrat Governor.
I don't know how the hell he ever got there. How did he get there? This is Louisiana, right? This is Louis -- how did you get a Liberal Democrat to be your Governor? Could you explain that please? No, I actually, no, it was a convergence of a lot of different things happen. And congratulations and your car insurance is the highest in the world, your taxes are horrible, you're rated number 50 in economic development.
Can you believe it? With all that we're doing, you're rated 50 out of 50, but we want to send Governor, and I mean, I've known this man for a long time. He's an incredible talent. He's an incredible businessman. He doesn't need the money. He's a wonderful person. He has the backing of Ralph. And I tell you what, Ralph is a winner.
You know Ralph, right? Ralph Abraham. Right? He has the backing of Ralph. I just spent a lot of time with Ralph Abraham. We came in together, Ralph, wouldn't have missed it, and he's an incredible man. He's an incredible man and he respects Eddie, and Eddie respects him a lot. They had a hard-fought deal, but they respect each other and like each other a lot.
And that's rare because I'll tell you what, if I'm going against somebody, I don't know if I can ever like him. I don't know. But Ralph is a better man than me. He's a better man. And they're going to put that all over television tonight because they're going to say Ralph should run for President if that's the case and that's OK. Now, he is. He's a great man.
So, Eddie Rispone is not a career politician. He's a business leader, highly, highly respected, a man of faith, and a lifelong Louisiana patriot and many of you know Eddi through his success. Eddie will cut your taxes and regulations. He will cut your car insurance in half. We have the highest car insureds in the entire nation by far.
Some people call it auto insurance, call it whatever the heck you want. You have the highest in the country, he's going to cut it in half or more, and turn this state into a giant magnet for great-paying jobs. That's what he wants to do. Eddie is tough on crime, strong on borders, and he'll work with ICE and Border Patrol to get violent criminals off the streets.
We'll bring them back to their country ideally or we'll put them in jail where they belong. Eddie is pro-energy, pro-family, pro-life, and pro-Second Amendment totally. Eddie will defend your values from the all-out assault by the extreme left. That's what they are. They're the extreme left. I call them AOC-plus-three.
AOC, that's a real beauty. You only have eleven years to live, folks, eleven years, because climate change is just coming up on a [Inaudible]. You know, it's 12 years but today, I heard one of these crazies say, it's down to eleven, and they arrested Jane Fonda. Nothing changes. I remember 30, 40 years ago.
They're -- she always has the handcuffs on. Oh man, she's waving to everybody with the handcuffs. I can't believe it. They -- remember that? She went to Vietnam to find out how nice they were. They weren't too nice to her by the way. No, they arrested her today, Jane Fonda, nothing changes. They arrest every, every, 25 years, they arrest her.
Eddie's opponent is a radical Liberal, and you didn't know that. In fact, he even says good things about me, but he'll never vote for me. You know why he says good things about me? Because he thinks you'd like me. If he didn't otherwise, he'd say bad. But here's the thing, he'll say good things. In fact, I said he must be a Republican.
He sometimes says better about me than most Republicans, but here's the problem, he'll never vote for us. He'll never support our Second Amendment the way we need the support. He's never going to reduce your car insurance. He's never going to cut your taxes. He's had a long time, he wasn't able to do it. I got you a big tax cut, the biggest ever.
I mean the Democrats, I have this crazy theory. I don't know how it works. I don't think I could be a successful Democrat. You know one of the theories? We're going to raise your taxes. Now, how does that work? I'm always saying we're going to get you a bigger. We are, we're going to cut your taxes more.
They're saying -- look what do I know? I've only been doing this for three years, but they say, we're going to raise your taxes. And I'm saying, excuse me, does that work? That's what they say. Now, I'm going to cut your taxes even further and you see what it's done for our country. But you have a radical Liberal named John Bel Edwards.
Edward was an ardent supporter of crooked Hillary Clinton and she is crooked as hell. [Audience shouts "Boo"] John Bel Edwards broke his solemn promise to the people of Louisiana when he rammed, that's the only word I could say, rammed through the largest tax hike in Louisiana history. Does everybody remember that?
He gave you the largest tax hike and he probably says, I raised your taxes, vote for me. No, I'm saying this, I lowered your taxes. I gave you the greatest tax reduction in the history of our country, greater even than Ronald Reagan's reduction many years ago. Now, maybe that doesn't work in modern-day politics, but you know what, I'm going to stick with it, whether it does or not, I'm sticking.
And you see what's happened, billions and billions and trillions of dollars is coming back into the country. We're the hottest economic force anywhere in the world, anywhere in the world, and taking in more. With a lower rate, we're taking in more money than we did with a higher rate. That's a pretty good statement.
He violated your sacred trust and can never be trusted again. He raised your taxes and he's done nothing about your car insurance. You know, one of the big things here is car insurance, right? And I kept saying, what are the things -- because I want to pinpoint it and I kept seeing car insurance. That's very unusual.
I've never heard that with the state. I never thought of car insurance, right? But here your car insurance is the highest in the nation and it's out of control, and it's so easy to do. Now, Edwards is trying to demolish your state's economy by shutting down Louisiana Energy on behalf of the crazy radical far-left.
[Audience shouts "Boo"] Edwards is totally owned by the Liberal trial lawyers, who are causing your state insurance rates and car insurance to skyrocket through the roof. Perhaps, most disturbing, Edwards has allowed illegal aliens to steal millions of dollars and healthcare from hardworking Louisiana citizens.
[Audience shouts "Boo"] He cares more about illegal aliens than he cares about Louisiana citizens. I'll tell what, I love our military, Eddie loves our military. They care more about illegal aliens than taking care of our vets and taking care of our military. Edwards is dangerously soft on crime, you know that.
And Louisiana has the highest murder rate. I hate to say this, please turn off those television cameras immediately. I don't want to say it, but you have the highest murder rate anywhere in the United States. I didn't know that. I didn't want to say it. OK, I'm sure they turned it off because they really listened.
Edwards is backed by his fellow open border extremists and pro-abortion lobby. Edwards is a complete disaster for the state of Louisiana, and you cannot afford four more years of this far-left travesty. It is time to replace your failed Governor John Bel Edwards with Eddie Rispone, who is going to do an incredible job.
So, everybody needs to get out and vote early, vote early, 40%. I can't believe four -- I never heard 40%. Usually, it's like 2%, then they say don't worry about it. But early voting has started so get out and vote for Eddie Rispone and do it right away. And then, let's go to the football game and let's do lots of things, do lots of things.
Do it before the game or just make sure you get it out. And you know, the election itself is going to be taking place Saturday. So get out, get out, get out early, get out early, get out early. So, I want to bring up a man that I've gotten to know well, but I know him through reputation because he's really a business legend in many ways, and he's going to put that genius to work for you, Eddie Rispone.
Please come up. Please come up. [Audience chants "Eddie"]
That is crazy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Before I get started, I want to say this, Congressman Abraham, I would not be here. John Bel might be your Governor today if it wouldn't be for Congressman Abraham working very hard, the two of us traveling the state to make sure that we got the vote out and let the state of Louisiana know that we can do better.
Let's give him another round of applause. Louisiana is Trump country. Is that right? We're so grateful to the President to come down here more than once now to get out the vote, to mobilize, to make Louisiana great like it deserves to be. We need something different if we want to be different. We don't deserve to be last.
We are last, folks. We have got to do something different and it starts by electing a different kind of Governor. We need a pro-Trump conservative, an outsider, someone with serious business skills, someone who is not beholden to special interests, someone is -- that's got backbone to go against the status quo, someone like Trump.
That's what we need and we want to thank the President for coming here and exposing John Bel Edwards down here, as a Liberal as he is. Thank you. John Bel Edwards would want you to believe he's not one of those Liberal lunatics that are following and trying to impeach our President. We can send a message to them by voting me in and voting and supporting our President Donald Trump.
Listen, I didn't think they could go any lower, folks, but just this Saturday, they're running ads now and push cards all over this state, accusing our President of being a racist and me being a racist, and you being a racist. [Audience shouts "Boo"] It is disgusting where -- how low they will go, that is their MO when they start panicking and worrying, they play the race card.
It's unacceptable. We have a President here that has had the lowest unemployment for minorities in the history of United States and you call him a racist. We need to send them a message, folks. Louisiana is Conservative, we're going to have a Conservative Governor, an outsider, a businessman, someone who would make us number one in the nation.
We can do that with your vote. [Audience chants "Eddie"] Thank you. That is amazing. That is amazing. This man can get the crowd fired up and he get Louisiana fired up. So, we go out in early vote and turn this state around. Thank him. I need your support. I need your vote and my wife and my family can use your prayers.
Thank you. And I'm going to take one more liberty, Go Tigers. Beat Bama. This is amazing right here.
Thank you, Eddie. Great job. Thank you. [Audience chants "Four more years"] Thank you very much. Thank you, Eddie. Good man, great man, going to be a great Governor. We're also thrilled to be joined tonight by many of your wonderful Louisiana leaders, and I have to say right now, two of them, they're warriors.
They're incredible warriors. I'll ask them to come up for just a second. But they don't stop, very different type personalities, both unbelievable. They fight so hard for me, for you. They love this state. They love this country, Senator Bill Cassidy, Senator John Kennedy, come on up, fellas.
You're doing great. Let me just echo what Eddie Rispone said, this is Trump Country. And let me add to what he said, with your help but only with your help, we can make it Rispone Country. Thank you.
Hello, Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. President for visiting our state. In three short years, President Trump has doubled the growth in the greatest economy in all of human history. And you know what our Democratic friends have done for him? [Unidentified] Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to impeach him. I don't mean any disrespect but it must suck to be that dumb.
Let me tell you, let me tell you one other thing, the same people that are backing speaker Pelosi are sending tens of millions of dollars to support Governor Edwards. [Audience shouts "Boo"] And all he has given us, all Governor Edwards has given us is decline and uncertainty. Now, unless, unless you're happy with crappy, I want your vote for Eddie Rispone for Governor.
And I want you, I want you to vote for Kyle Ardoin for Secretary of State, and I want you, this is important, I want you to vote for Robert Mills for the Louisiana State Senate. God bless Louisiana, God bless our President, and God bless the United States of America. [Audience chants "USA"]
Two great guys, two great warriors, two people that love your state and they love our country and I appreciate it very much. Two great Senators. So, I just want to bring up for a second, a man who is an incredible campaigner, an incredible Congressman. You talk about loving our country, he'll die for our country, he'll die for the people of this state.
He loves the people of this state. He did really, really well. It was a tight race and he is all in for Eddie and that's Ralph Abraham. Congressman, come on up, Ralph.
Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Mr. President, thank you for coming to Monroe, Louisiana, and thank you for making America great again. Now, Mr. President, this crowd and all of Louisiana, loves to win. We're going to celebrate again when the Saints win the Super Bowl. We're going to celebrate again when LSU wins the national championship, and President Trump we're going to celebrate you when you once again rid the world of evil terror like Al Baghdadi.
Thank you. But you heard the President, we are dead last. We must do better, and to our veterans here whose shadow that we stand in every day, to our farmers and our ranchers that till the land and herd the cattle from dawn to dusk, for our oil and gas industry that has, as you heard the President say, made us energy dominant, to our law enforcement that runs toward the bullet when we run away, and to all of us that fill up their church pews on Sunday morning, and pray to a loving and caring God, we will win this race.
So, Mr. President, Mr. President, you have shown the world what America could do. You have shown the world what America can do, and more importantly, Mr. President, you have shown the world what America will do when we're challenged. So, we're going to win this race. Go vote Saturday for Eddie. Let's get this thing done, put the horse in the barn and go win a ball game. Thank you.
Thank you very much. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. We appreciate it. I call Ralph I said, Ralph, I'd love to have you. He said, sir, if you want me, if you need me, I'm here, and that's a real man. Thank you very much. That's a real man, and they're friends, they're real friends. So, where's Mason?
You know Ralph said, Mason, where's Mason? Ralph was saying where are you Mason? What a job he did, what did you do? Fly around the world as the youngest person ever or something, huh? Well, Ralph said I got to mention, so I got to mention you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Very important to Ralph. I want to thank other of our incredible, and I call them warriors because that's what they are, they have to be today.
They won't be around long, Garret Graves, great Congressman. Garrett, thank you, Garrett, great job. They fight hard. Jobs tougher than we all thought, it shouldn't be tough at all, but they made it tough. We have people that made it a lot tougher than it's supposed to be, but these are incredible people, Clay Higgins, thank you, Clay, and Mike Johnson, thanks, Mike, great job all of you.
And your state's Attorney General. Somebody I've known for a long time, he's terrific, Jeff Landry. And two terrific men on the ballot with Eddie. John mentioned that, Kyle Ardoin, and your next state Senator, Robert Mills. We're also joined by Louisiana's own Phil and Willie Robertson, I love them. I can learn plenty from these two.
Come on up here. Come up, come up, fellas. Come up. Great people. They've been with us from the beginning, right from the beginning. Smart as can be and wonderful people and they hit big. They hit big and you don't on hit big unless you have it. Come on up, fellas.
I got it -- I got it down to this if you're pro-God and pro-America and pro-gun and pro-duck hunting. That's all I want.
Well, I don't know what else to say after following Phil and the President and Eddie, but thank you guys so much. You have been such a great community to share life with, to worship with, and I'm so tickled to be here with the President that he actually came down to our community, and let's go, Eddie.
Thank you, fellas, two great guys. They were with me right at the beginning. I said who are they? They said they're two big television stars. I said, wow, and then, I started watching a little bit. A lot of wisdom there. Republican policies are lifting up Americans from every background and every walk of life.
America is an economic powerhouse again like never before, actually, like never before. We eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, saving an estimated $3,000 per household. We also passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history, saving a typical family of four another $2,000, and we're boldly adopting a policy of American energy independence.
We don't have to go to these faraway places anymore. I was at the opening of the $10 billion Cameron LNG export facility in Hackberry, Louisiana, employing thousands and thousands of Louisiana workers. They couldn't get their permits for years. I got them real fast [Inaudible]. I said how long? I said let's go get them that permit.
For years and years they tried to get those permits, they couldn't get them. I got them very fast and we cut a ribbon a couple of months ago. It's incredible. I've never seen a building like that one. There are more pipes in that building than I've ever seen before. Meanwhile, every top Democrat running for President has pledged to abolish all American production of oil and natural gas.
Shipping thousands of your state's energy jobs overseas -- that's all they're doing. [Audience shouts "Boo"] But Louisiana will not give them that chance. We are reversing decades of disastrous trade policies. Louisiana lost one in four manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.
Past leaders did not care one bit what happened to those Louisiana communities because they were getting rich by sacrificing your wealth to other countries. You remember? We talk about it all the time, but under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America is no longer for sale. Thanks to my tariffs, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from a country that never gave us 10 cents, China.
Can you imagine if we ever let the radical Democrats take over negotiations with China? It wouldn't be too good. Let's get Hunter to do it, right? Let's get Hunter. come on Hunter. Come on Hunter. Let's see how you do Hunter. China would love it more than anything else. They'd love to be dealing with a different President.
They actually do like me, but they don't like me what I'm doing exactly to them. They're having the worst year they've had in 57 years, but it's not going to happen that way, because we can't let our country go back to the days of being ransacked and plundered by other nations. We will not be taken advantage of any longer.
Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects. They decimated American factories. You know this, American manufacturing was broken and decimated to promote -- they promoted economic growth in foreign countries. They didn't promote economic growth in our country.
They used our military to defend immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money, and they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into disrepair, $8 trillion was spent in the Middle East and you want to fix a highway. They say, well, that's pretty expensive, right?
Not anymore, but I was elected to be the President of the United States, not the President of the world. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. And we are finally putting America First, haven't heard that for a long time. Past leaders transformed faraway nations into chaotic war zones, then they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted regions, stamping their visas for travel straight into your communities, not anymore.
My administration implemented the travel ban to block migration from some of the world's most dangerous and deadly places. And we're keeping terrorists, criminals, and violent extremists the hell out of our country. That's what we're doing. On no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than immigration.
They threw you open, and you saw it, all through the years. They threw open your borders to drug dealers, human traffickers, and to vicious MS-13 gang members, and now, we're getting them out of the country by the thousands. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have now dropped 70% since May.
And when you look at what's happening over there, there's a good reason for what we're doing. We are building that wall faster than anyone thought it was possible to build, the Army Corps of engineers. We're also confronting the deadly menace of sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminal aliens into your neighborhoods, school zones, and city streets.
Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, and law enforcement. In the last administration, vile slanders of our police went unanswered and unchallenged. Now, we are once again condemning anti-police bias and giving our officers the respect that say -- that they so rightly deserve.
If you want to show your love and support for American law enforcement and just plain success of your state and your country, then vote early for Eddie Rispone. Democrats are becoming more extreme by the day. The Democrats plan government takeover of healthcare would demolish your Medicare. I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors.
We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, and we will also protect patients with pre-existing physicians. Democrats want to take away our doctors. Republicans will strongly defend your right to keep your doctor. You remember that with President Obama, you keep your doctor, you keep your plan, 28 times.
It was a lie. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in over 50 years. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment -- [Audience shouts "Boo"] right up to the moment of birth.
That is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream.
It's also the party of the late great Abraham Lincoln, people forget. We have confirmed already 158 incredible judges to interpret the Constitution as written, including two great Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Our historic investment in rebuilding the military has included more than $30 million to Barksdale.
Do you know where that is? Do you know where that is? Barksdale, where's Barksdale? Nice, good? Barksdale Air Force Base right here in Louisiana. At $40 million, two naval air station joint reserve base in New Orleans. I withdrew from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem, and we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights after 52 years.
For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. Now, you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Louisiana. The next step to victory begins in this state and it begins with you right now. With your support, we will show the corrupt Democrats and they are corrupt do-nothing Democrats that the American people are not backing down.
We need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, and get out to vote early for Eddie. And if you don't vote early, I'll be back on Thursday to get you to vote on Saturday, OK? With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity.
Together, we will elect a Republican Congress. We're going to be able to do that. We have to be able to do that to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration and many other things. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, made in the USA.
We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Did you know that? Within 10 years. I never knew we could do it until recently and we've put up the money. We'll have the AIDS epidemic ended. Who would have thought we could have done that?
We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday very soon, we will land an American astronaut on the surface of Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America.
We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor, our history, and to always respect our great American flag.
And we live by the words of our national motto, and they will never ever change as long as we're here, In God We Trust. And it maybe 120 degrees in this room -- and I don't know about you, but I'm having a good time. It's a pretty hot room. A little hot, a little hot. Somebody's saving on air conditioning.
That's all right. We always got to save a little money. You go home, you lose about nine pounds, you say what happened? Well, I went to Louisiana with some great friends and I lost about nine pounds, and maybe more. We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who crossed oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized the industry, pioneer signs, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making a greater every single day.
Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together, we are taking back our country. Some really -- I mean, do you believe what's going on in Washington with these do-nothing somewhat evil, and in some cases, very evil people, but that's the way it is, and here's the story, we're winning. We're winning like never before.
And if we weren't winning, they wouldn't care, life would be a lot of fun in Washington, probably, but we have to do what we were sent to do, right? We're returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
Let me ask you this, are the people of Louisiana getting tired of winning? Is anybody getting tired? [Audience shouts "No"] Because I could go to John and Bill and I could say, fellas do me a favor, they'll come in, they'll be told by you, Senators we're winning too much, we can't take it anymore. There's too much winning.
We liked our old way of life. We had lousy jobs, we got paid very little, there was no business, there was no nothing. Please go to Washington and see the President and tell the President, please, please stop winning so much. We're working too hard in Louisiana, we're winning too much, and I'll look at them and I'll say, sorry, fellas, we're going to keep on winning.
Because we're one movement, we're one people, we're one family, and we are one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Louisiana, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will Make America Great Again. Thank you, Louisiana. Thank you. Thank you.
Wow. Thank you very much. Hello, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania. Well, I'm thrilled to be back in this state that gave us American independence, you know that. American steel, which we now have coming back, by the way, like never before and generations of American patriots. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. This is an incredible time for our country.
The unemployment rate in Pennsylvania has just reached an all-time historic low. That's a pretty good stat. How do you beat that? Somebody is going to come and run and they're going to say they're going to do good in the history of this country. You just hit an all-time low. That's pretty tough to beat.
We've ended the last administration's eight-year war on Pennsylvania energy, and we're unleashing clean coal and shale, and America is now their No. 1producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. Man, there's a lot of people. I think next time we would just have to get a bigger hanger. That's a big hanger, we're gonna get a bigger hanger. Thank you.
Thank you very much. You know I thought that was the sun in my eyes, It's these stupid lights. These people, I mean what are we -- what are they doing? Is there any way they can turn those lights down, folks? Crazy. You've got a thing called the sun. We like the sun better than the artificial nonsense. Wages are going way up, crime is going way down, and our military is more powerful right now than ever before.
And when we took over two and a half years ago, our military was in big trouble, it was depleted, you know that. It was depleted, the equipment was old, the planes were all -- we have the most beautiful fighter jets in the world being delivered now, every day. Every day. Our spirit is strong, our stride is back and our stand is clear.
We are finally putting, like I said, America first.
And after years of building up foreign countries, we are now building up our country. It's about time. We've got the hottest economy anywhere in the world. The United States added 263,000 jobs just last month, far exceeding any expectations. And since the election, we've created nearly 6 million new jobs.
Now, if I would have ever said that to the fake news media, look at how many back there, wow, that's a lot of people. That's a lot of people. Looks like the Academy Awards used to look before they decided to go political against us. Now the Academy Awards is [Inaudible], but that includes a half a million brand new manufacturing jobs, which the previous administration said will never happen, will never happen, and it wouldn't have happened if you had them or the like.
Right here in Pennsylvania, we've added 155,000 new jobs, including 20,000 new construction jobs, nobody thought that was possible.
And more than 5 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. We're getting Americans off welfare and back into the workforce, and it's happening by the thousands and thousands, and thousands. One million people have been lifted out of poverty and the poverty rate for African Americans has reached the lowest level ever recorded.
The Hispanic-American, African-American, and Asian-American unemployment rates have also reached an all-time historic low.
Those debates should be very easy when we meet whoever we're going to meet, because, statistically I mean -- maybe I don't know, who knows, politics is a crazy world, but when you have the best employment numbers in history, when you have the best unemployment numbers in history, when you have the best economy, probably that we've ever had, I don't know how to help you lose this election, right?
And actually, that's just the beginning.
Joining us tonight are many terrific Pennsylvania Republican leaders. At the forefront of America's economic revival, including members of Congress, G.T. Thompson, Scott Perry, and Dan Meuser. You know them. You know them. Big -- by the way, they've really been great in Congress and they've helped me, they're warriors.
Also, we have a couple of very popular guys that are with us and they've been incredible friends of mine, Tom Marino and Lou Barletta. Where are they? Oh hello, fellas. Great people. Thank you.
And also, Pennsylvania GOP Chair Val DiGiorgio. Thank you, Val. As you know, tomorrow there is a crucial election,that's why I'm here. I'm here to see you but I'll be seeing a lot of you over the next year. I'll be here a lot. Got to win this state, got to win this state. We did great last time. Remember the polls, the fake polls that they put out, suppression.
They call them suppression polls.
Pennsylvania will go to Hillary Clinton, unfortunately for them, didn't work out that. So -- but do you remember that night? They wouldn't announce Pennsylvania. There was 1% left. If I lost every single vote, I would win, they wouldn't do it. It got later and later and then they announced Michigan, we won, Wisconsin, we won, and then they finally announced,we won the great state of Pennsylvania for a long time.
They had a hard time with that one, but we have a big race tomorrow. You got to go, raise your right hand, you all promise I'm going to go out and vote? And you know, you're voting for so we have a great gentleman very successful businessman. The 12th Congressional District, the Democrat running for the seat is a radical socialist.
The Democrat candidate wants to open your borders and we're fighting like hell with the worst laws to get those borders closed. The wall is being built as we speak, we'll have almost 500 miles of wall by the end of next year. It's terrible, terrible. Look at that. Can you get him up here? Get him up here, come on. Look at this guy.
Now we know who he's voting for.
Thank you very much. He said, "I'm from San Diego.", you believe that? He said, "I'm from San Diego and we need that wall." And you know in San Diego, as you know, it's going up and now it's up and here's what they did in California, they wanted the wall so badly, and so I did it, and I said you know, maybe I shouldn't do it politically.
Let them ask, I did it, and now it's beautiful people not coming in, it's beautiful, right? In San Diego, and now they go out and say we didn't want the wall in the first place. They didn't. They wanted the wall desperately because they were being flooded with illegal immigrants. Is that right? Flooded.
Now they don't have that, but now they find that it's a terrible situation we're in, but that's OK, because we always win. Somehow we always find a way to win. Now, it would be awfully good if we sat down for 15 minutes, we could stop up that border so perfectly. The laws and the judges are so against us, it's actually incredible, but we're going to win and we're winning now, but it's -- it shouldn't be hard, it should be really easy.
We raise, you know that. You know the word raise taxes? Does anybody like it? They want to raise your taxes. They go out and say, "We as Democrats want to raise your taxes." They want to shut down your American energy. They think these are good things. They want to destroy your second amendment, no more second amendment.
The Republican candidate, somebody who is absolutely a winner, somebody that I don't want to take a chance.
You know, normally, I could do other things tonight. I like you, I love this state. I figured, "Hey, it's a Monday, we have an election tomorrow, who the hell wants to sit around doing nothing on Monday night, right? And by the way, the first lady sends her regards, she loves this state, doing a great job.
She campaigned here on our last day just before the election.
But we have a man who's, a special man he's a successful business man and owner. He believes in protecting the border, defending our Second Amendment. He's not letting anything happen to your Second Amendment. And you know what? If we aren't smart it'll end for you with the Second Amendment, it'll end for you and so many other things your taxes will go up. You know they're talking about 70, 75% right, you know what we have it down to and we got the business tax down to 21% from essentially over 40%.
Fred Keller is a tough man, he's tough on crime. He loves our military, loves our police, he loves our vets and he will always protect patients and he will always go for like me, and I say it so strongly because the fake news doesn't want to say it. We will always protect pre-existing conditions, very important.
And by the way, we got rid of the individual mandate, the worst part of Obamacare, and we almost had it repealed and replaced.
But we had one man that after campaigning for eight years, he decided to go thumbs down at two o'clock in the morning. That's all right, but we'll end up -- will end up with even better, because we have plans that are even better than that, so that's good. Sometimes, when you have adversity, it works out actually better, but I want Fred to please come on up. You have to get out tomorrow.
Fred Keller, 12th District he's going to be a great congressman. Fred.
Mr. President, welcome to Central Pennsylvania. Thank you for coming tonight to show your support for the hardworking people of Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District. The people of northeastern and north central Pennsylvania have been behind you since day one. And Mr. President, our support for you is as strong today as it ever was.
In 2016, Pennsylvania put Donald Trump over the top, and in 2020, we're going to do it again. Mr. President, since you took office, our economy is booming, more people are working, wages are rising, and America again is respected across the globe. Pennsylvania, do we want four more years? We do, Mr. President, we are making America great again.
I'm running for Congress to help President Trump take care of our vets, make the middle class tax cuts permanent, build the wall and make sure that in everything we do, we always make sure America's workers and families come first.
Our opponent, he wants to help Nancy Pelosi and the Washington liberals, he wants to help them pass the Green New Deal, take away your health care, and obstruct what our President is doing, the stakes couldn't be higher. This election, we're gonna elect Donald Trump. President again in 2020, but this election, it begins tomorrow.
It begins tomorrow with a special election right here in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District. Folks, there couldn't be more at stake. You need to talk to your friends, family, and neighbors and tell them if they want to help President Trump make America great, they need to get out tomorrow and vote to send me to Congress.
Thank you. God bless you. God bless our President and God bless the United States of America.
Thank you, Fred. Go get 'em, Fred. So get out tomorrow, it's a little bit of a referendum. You know a lot of people are watching this race. I don't know if there are other races or not, who the hell cares, we have Fred. We have to get Fred in there tomorrow. If he wins, they won't report it. If he loses it will be the greatest story in the history of our country.
They will make that into -- and we don't want that. They will make that into the single greatest event that our country has ever seen. I've had it before where somebody comes, you know when we campaign for people they win and a lot of cases, Andy Barr in Kentucky and I'm not just -- I'm also -- You know, we also won the Senate.
You wouldn't believe that if you read, we won the Senate, we picked up two additional seats. Remember they were going to win the Senate, but I campaigned I made 32 major stops in a short period of time. Do you think that's easy? And then I had to make two more on the final day of a runoff. Cindy Hyde-Smith, she won, she did great, she did great, but that was -- that was a lot of work and we won the Senate, we got no praise, we got no acclaim -- we got nothing.
But you know what, tomorrow Fred is a lot of -- lot of people are watching a lot of those fakers back there watching and they're going to -- they're going to be reporting very positively, I'm sure if he wins but gotta have -- you got ta make sure he wins, please. You know they'll say? "President Trump came to Pennsylvania and he went back home a loser."
I never want to be called a loser. Remember this, we, altogether, we, I, we, ran one time and we're one and all, you know, but it was a big one. Now we're going to have a second time, we're going to have another one, and then we'll drive them crazy, you're ready? And maybe, if we really like it a lot and if things keep going like they go on we'll go and we'll do what we have to do. We'll do a three and four or five but they'll have tomorrow.
We knew he -- oh, I don't want to say. Now we're going to have another one, and it's going to be great, and you know, one of the things we're talking about, the greatest, probably, I think political slogan of all time is what you have in your heads, Make America Great Again, but now our military is so powerful, we're taking on countries and trade that the Democrats and Republicans didn't do anything about, in all fairness.
For years and years, China, and so many other countries, I don't want to embarrass us because, frankly, a lot of them are great people, but they don't understand how they got away with it either, but we have to make a decision soon. Do we keep our logo? Do we keep our slogan, Make America Great Again? Or it's very risky changing the most successful slogan has to be. They think that was one of the greatest elections of all time and now we're taking the slogan or the logo from that election and possibly changing it. But we've had 101 or 102 all-time high stock markets, record stock markets.
We have just about the best unemployment in history, including the absolute best for African-American Asian, as you know, and Hispanic, so we have all of these records that we've been setting our military strong, our Second Amendment is good, everything's good. So do we make it Make America great Again? And we're gonna go with cheers here, one way or the other, or do we make it Keep America Great?
Because you have some of -- look, you know this, you have some of these socialist wackos, they want to double and triple your taxes and that won't come close to paying for it. They want to knock down all buildings in Manhattan and rebuild them without windows, you know about that. Let's rebuild them, glass is no good.
We don't want windows, I used to love the view, but I think we'll all be forced to close up windows. No, it's crazy what they're saying, so many different things. So do we want Keep America Great or Make America Great Again. We'll go Keep America Great first, ready. So Keep America Great or Make America First, Keep America Great.
Now it's very hard to leave something that was so successful.
I've heard people say even though it's not spot on because in theory we've made America great again. We certainly will by the time of the election, but you look at the numbers, but it's so good. It's very hard to take a expression and say, "Let's change it." So let me have it for make America Great Again.
So now we go, ready?, Keep America Great.
Ready, Make America Great Again. Wow, wow. Well, I like it because we'll sell many, many more hats that way. We'll keep the hat the same color though, right? You understand what I'm saying, though, that -- right? Keep America Great looking, I've had that response from others. It's amazing I like to do polls that are cheap.
I hate to say it. This is a cheap poll, but it's better than any poll you could get. You ever see they go out in the interview like 103 people. I got thousands here tonight. Well, I think we'll have to consider that then, but either way it's going to be great. We're gonna have a great campaign. We have a great country and we have in fact made America great again.
We brought it back and brought it back and I'll tell you our country is respected again. All you have to do is speak to the folks in China in Japan. Speak to the folks no matter where you go, the European nations you speak to them. You go European Union as an example they've badly mistreated us for many years, but they sound good.
I say the biggest -- they're all European Union. We need a doctor, please, a doctor, please. We have a doctor, doctor in the house, please. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Take your time. Some of these people in the front row they've been here for two days and I don't I don't blame them, right. I don't blame them.
They've been waiting in line for two days and stuff. Thank you, fellas. Thank you. Take your time, doctor. Take your time. Those are our friends right there. Those are our friends. Take your time. How they're doing? Are they -- she's going to be good, gonna be good. Doc, everything okay? You good? Good. Thank you.
We stick together, folks. We stick together. Take your time. Take your time.
We love you too. Even with that powerful man's voice. I love that guy. I think I'm in love. Thank you. Thank you very much and thank you, thank you. Thank you for taking -- Doctor, thank you for such a good job. Thank you very much. Under my administration, we're reversing years of failed trade policies that crushed Pennsylvania's middle class.
You know that better than anybody, you know it better than anybody what they did to Pennsylvania, in particular, Ohio, Pennsylvania, some of the states in particular. Frankly, North Carolina, what they did was disgraceful what they did to the workers. They took out your businesses. They moved them to other countries, they sold back the product with no taxes, nothing, you lost your jobs, we lost revenue and nobody even apologized except me. I said we're going to turn it around and that's what we've done.
Now we have companies are pouring back into our country, they want to be where the action is they're pouring back, including the auto companies.
In the eight years before my election, the United States lost a quarter of a million manufacturing jobs, but the great betrayal of the American worker ended on day one the day I took office, and you know that better than anyone. The forgotten men and women of America Will never ever be forgotten again, not going to happen and they're looking for you, they're trying to figure out who the hell were all these people.
Where did they come from, remember? They're deplorables, they're deplorable. You know I watched her speech. Well, she actually said, "I thought worse." She said deplorables and didn't she say irredeemables? To show you how good I am politically. I said, "Oh, that's a killer." The word irredeemable is -- well, it turned out to be deplorable was the word that caught on, right?
I would say, irredeemable is worse than deplorable, what do you think?
But they believe in both and not only her. That's the Democrats. Upon my inauguration, I inherited one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated. It was ready to be put into action, the Trans-Pacific Partnership that would have destroyed the state of Pennsylvania.
The TPP was a gift for the lobbyists and the donors, and the special interests in the foreign countries that have made a fortune hurting the American worker. The TPP would have been a catastrophe for the people of Scranton and Allentown and Pittsburgh. In my first week, I proudly withdrew the United States from further negotiations on that job killing disaster, which by the way, would have destroyed our auto business, would have destroyed it. Just like NAFTA, just like NAFTA was such a disaster.
This would have been worse. It's no wonder that when Joe Biden announced he's running for President. By the way, by the way, by the way we have thousands of people so -- and this is it I'm not even announcing today, we'll wait for a couple of weeks, OK? This is just, we go in for Fred, look at the thousands and thousands of people we have.
Now, they said he had 600 people, no, not very good, not very good. I'd say 150, and that was an announcement, right? I'd, say 150 people, but he announced he's running for president. He said it's because foreign leaders called him up and begged him to do it. Absolutely. Foreign countries liked it much better, that's what they want.
They want Biden so that China can continue to make $500 billion a year and more ripping off the United States. They like it. You look at what these countries have made. We lost on just trade, $800 billion on average for many years, 800 billion, not million, eight hundred million's a lot. Eight hundred billion is not even conceivable, and we didn't do anything about it, and I mean, not only President Obama, I mean others too.
It's a shame, but we're straightening it out. It's not easy. It's not easy because we have a lot of assaults from within, but we're straightening it out, and it's getting done and you see what's going with China we're taking in, we will soon be taken in over 100 billion dollars in tariffs. Remember this, they subsidized their product.
People are moving from China now to go to areas that are entire, we're going to build places in Pennsylvania and others rather than like the old days. Remember the old days, we actually made our own product. OK, we made our own product very expensive for China. They're not happy, but that's OK, it'll all work out.
Foreign countries liked it much better when they could push us around, rip us off, and make us pay for the privilege of handing over our jobs and handing over our wealth.
Eight long years ago, if you remember, I said it's really bad we're never going back the previous administration, what they did to our country. They should be ashamed of themselves. Sleepy Joe said that he's running to quote "save the world." Well, he was he's going to save every country, but ours. And remember he said a week ago, "China's not a competitor, China is not a competitor, you know, hey, look.
What they've done to us is indescribable economically. We have rebuilt China, they've done a great job and I don't blame China. I don't blame President Xi, I don't blame them. Look, we allowed it to happen. Our leaders allowed it to happen. Well, it's not happening anymore. I ran and we have Saved America.
We made America great again and we're going to keep America great. That's what it is. And if you don't mind we're going to take a little bit of money out of the $100 billion that we're saving we're going to take a little bit of money. What? OK, doctor, get the same doctor, get the same doctor. He was great.
Are you OK? OK? We'll be OK, go ahead, take your time. Take your time. I love these people. I love them. Take your time. Will be OK, they say. Come on. Let's go make sure she's OK, make sure. You take your time. No, the truth is there's a lot of excitement at these rallies and they wait a long time and people are so -- I'm excited, I'm excited.
Lot of excitement, a lot of energy. We have a lot of low energy people out there that we're competing against, low energy, but vicious, they're vicious but they're low energy. Thank you. Yeah, no more spying on Trump. I think they learned that didn't work out too well. You did a good job. You did a good job.
Where is -- where is Don Jr.? Don? They liked the job you did, Don.
You OK? Thank you. Thank you very much, great job. Thank you. So the very same establishment that sacrificed our prosperity, weakened our military, and tied us down through endless wars that never ended folks, they never ended. You saw what we did with the caliphate. Now you have to understand, these people are stone-cold crazy.
So you never say you won because then they blow up his store, they hurt and kill people. They are totally crazy, but we beat and took 100% of the caliphate. The area, the land took 100% and did it very rapidly very. But we want to start bringing our people back home. We win and bring them back home and now they're asking us to repeat history and relive the same failures all over again the values that they brought you, like you wouldn't believe and we're never going to let it happen.
One of the worst fiascoes from our former leaders was the disaster of NAFTA. All buildings in Pennsylvania and New England, all over, it were a total -- they're empty, and even to this day, some were converted to nursing homes, some were taken over, but you still see the shock of what they went down and now we're replacing them with a brand new beautiful buildings.
We've got it up. We've got it working again, all over the country, we're building plants and factories like actually never ever before. Nearly two decades ago, the same politicians who gave us NAFTA also voted to admit China into the World Trade Organization, a disastrous, really decision. I mean, that was a disastrous decision.
Since then, we've lost 60,000, not jobs, listen to this, 60,000 factories.
Here's the good news, we're building them all back, they're coming back. You know, I used to give that because it was really two years ago, so many have come back, but I used to give that number and I used to say it's gotta be a mistake. You can't lose 60,000 factories and when the fake news didn't correct me, I knew that I was correct because of I was off by one factory they would have said, "You made a mistake." Past leaders, let China freely plunder the United States economy and take the crown jewels of American industry.
Now we are finally responding to years of chronic trade abuses by defending our workers with tariffs and anything else, that's necessary because nobody is going to steal our businesses.
Nobody is going to close our factories and nobody's going to close our plants anymore, they're, all coming back, and anyone who doesn't want to pay the tariffs has a simple solution, build your product in America, bring your factories back to Pennsylvania, where you want to be, anyway, you never wanted to leave in the first place, stupid policy and taxes forced you out under this administration, we're living by two simple rules: buy American and hire American, right?
Simple, simple.
To protect our national security, we also impose a 10% tariff on foreign aluminum and a 25% tariff on foreign steel, and what that's done for your aluminum and steel in this country is incredible. Now, just this month, United States Steel announced that it will invest more than $1 billion to completely transform and make new demand.
While you know that you know where this is right, next to Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Does anyone know Mind Valley Works near Pittsburgh? Is spending over a billion dollars, thousands of jobs, the newest, the finest equipment in the world they're going to make steel again in our country, they haven't been building new plants for decades together we're putting Pennsylvania's steel back into the spine of America and as we defend Our jobs, who are also defending our borders, and it's tough, as I said, no betrayal of American workers has been worse than the Democrat Party's pursuit of open borders.
They want everybody to come in and they're coming up by the thousands and I'll tell you what our border patrol or law enforcement, ICE, they are working, they're apprehending 30, 40, 50,000 people at times, I mean, just in short periods of times. The laws are so bad if you don't release them they arrest you.
They arrest people that are working in law enforcement. It's a disgrace. Democrat backed policies have left our borders overrun our detention facilities overwhelmed as fast as we build them. They fill up and our hospitals, schools and public resources overburdened. Our country is full, we don't want people coming up here.
Our country is full. We want Mexico to stop, we want all of them to stop. Our country is packed to the gills. We don't want them coming up. Democrats claim to take care of the poor, that's what they want to do. It's not happening that way. The poor are being hurt, the middle income are being hurt, we would lose our businesses, we would lose everything if we go with the people that you see that are running for office.
You saw that. Last night I watch AlFred E. Neuman, what's going on with Fox, by the way? What's going on there? Putting more Democrats on than you have Republicans, there's something strange is going on in Fox. Something very strange. Did you see this guy last night, I didn't want to watch him. You always have to watch the competition, if you call it that.
And he was knocking the hell out of Fox, and Fox has put him, and somebody is going to have to explain the whole Fox deal to me. Democrats even want to give welfare and free health care to anyone who crosses our border.
They want free healthcare, free education, free anything. Republicans believe we should take care of our own people, our citizens, we have no choice. That's why we don't want him to come, and that's why my administration has published a new rule to ensure our limited supply of public housing is safeguarded for low income Americans, not for illegal aliens who are fighting to get it.
We'll soon be taking further action to ensure that federal benefits are preserved for hardworking citizens who need them the most. We're also outlining historic pro-American Immigration Reform. It's working its way through, I must tell you, some of it's not going to happen unless you vote for Republicans in the upcoming election, and I will tell you it's not very far away and you're going to have great immigration laws.
People have no idea how bad they were, to remember, even three or four weeks ago they would say, there's no emergency at the border, and now everybody's admitting, I agree, it is an emergency. I've been saying that for two years the choice is simple: Republican policies, protect U.S workers, democrat policies, protect smugglers, traffickers and even criminal aliens and drug dealers like you've never seen, the drugs were capturing them.
We don't let them go, recapture them and we do it very, very -- sadly, it's almost like routine, but you have drug dealers coming into our country and making our people sick and we're capturing them. And just one example, the sanctuary city of Philadelphia released a previously deported illegal alien from prison, rather than cooperate with federal authorities.
After his release that criminal alien raped a very young child, republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans not for criminal aliens, and we always stand with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. Our police have been incredible and we want to thank them too, because I'll tell you why.
Even tonight I see the way the way they're working, and I hope the cameras get to see this crowd.
You know, usually those show like for people behind me. People would say, wasn't a large crowd, I said, "Well, you could tell by the -- they can actually tell by the cheering. It sounds like a big football field." They don't like to show the crowd. Explain that to me you know I'm trying to tell them it's really good.
For television to show the crowd, don't you show a show like this there's three or four people behind me, that will be very famous tomorrow, but they have lousy seats tonight. So I think you're better. On the issue of the Democrat Party, it's never been further outside from the mainstream than it is now.
These people have gone nuts more than 120 Democrats in Congress have signed up for Bernie Sanders total government takeover of health care. Now, tell me many of you have phenomenal health care. You have private health care 180 million people they want to take it away from you.
They want to take away your health care, your health insurance they want to take it away. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion killing your Second Amendment and radical socialism. The Republican Party is the party that America wants. That's what America wants.
We're the party of the American worker, we're the party of the American family and we're the party of the American dream. Every day we've made good in our motto: Promises Made, Promises Kept. We've kept more promises than we've even made.
You take a look at what we've done between regulations and taxes, and I mean think of it, Right To Try. You know what Right To Try is? I won't go into it, you don't want to be there, but now we can give them the benefit of the great research we have the best in the world and there's a lot of great things happening.
I signed it eight months ago, a lot of great things happening with Right To Try. We passed the largest package of tax cuts in the history of our country. We eliminated 30,000 pages of job killing regulations from the Federal Register. That's an all-time record and I withdrew the United States. I thought I'd be hit hard on this one, and I was in just ask, how are they doing in Paris?
From the past administrations, job killing Paris Climate Accord, which would have cost a fortune and would hurt our country horribly.
We will never allow foreign bureaucrats and countries to trample on our sovereignty or to shut down our jobs, which is what that would have done. Yet. Every Democrat running for President wants to reopen the economic assault on Pennsylvania by crippling the coal and Shell industries and by crippling your now once again great steel industry.
Your steel industry is great, so if you want American energy, you have to go Republican. If you want a great country, you have to vote Republican. We've appointed more than 100 federal judges already, soon to be a record, to apply the law as written, including, well, you know this, two great Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, two great justices.
They're great. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs and last year, for the first time in 51 years, drug prices went down, first time in 51 years, but we're going to bring in a way down. And we passed V.A. choice and V.A. accountability to give our veterans the care that they deserve and they've been trying to pass these things for 45 years, we made a record setting investments in the United States military, including more than $70 million to build submarine propellers at the Naval Shipyard in a place called Philadelphia, and to protect America's security I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal.
Doctor, doctor. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Take your time again. We have all night, right? I don't know what this does to television, but that's, OK. How is she doing? OK?Take your time. Take your time, doc. Those lights bright enough? I think that's why people are going down these crazy lights and they look like they cost a fortune too.
I don't know, I don't know who -- I don't know who got those lights but they're very bright. A real genius got those lights. How's it going, doctor? Good? Good? Good. He's good. We take care of our people, we have great people. And I recognize Israel's capital and open the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just a few weeks ago, the United States acknowledged Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we stand with the People of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua in their righteous struggle to be free, so each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values.
We support the rule of law and the incredible men and women of law enforcement. Thank you all a lot of them here tonight. We protect, cherish and defend the Constitution of the United States, we reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism and the doctrine that we love our country.
We love our country.
We love the U.S.A., we believe in strong borders, strong families and a strong national defense. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that children should be taught to love our country to be proud of our history and you always respect our great American flag and we believe in the words of our national motto: In God We Trust.
These are the traditions, the customs and principles that bind us together as neighbors, as citizens as Americans. These are the values that unite people all across this magnificent state of Pennsylvania, where, by the way I went to school, I went to school in Pennsylvania, and these are the reasons I need you to get out and vote tomorrow for Fred Keller.
Got to get out. Big showing. We got to win tomorrow, Fred. Fred is going to be working all night, all day. Fred Keller tomorrow, folks, remind each other, call each other up, get out and vote. Can't take a chance, he's going to win, we're going to win. You joined our movement because you rejected the failures and betrayals of the past.
You stared down a corrupt system that enriched itself at your expense, and you look at what we just went through with this phony deal, this phony witch hunt that we all went through together is a disgrace. Now, they're all blaming each other, you see, they're all turning on each other, isn't that pretty to watch?
It's his fault, no, it's his fault. Now, we caught 'em. They were spying -- they were spying on our campaign. I'll tell you what, if that ever happened to the other side, this thing would have been over two years ago, and you know it would have been treason. They would have called it treason and that's what it is. It was treason and it should never be allowed to happen to another President again ever, ever, ever.
You reclaim your destiny, you defended your dignity and you took back your country.
Well, we have a great new attorney general, who is going to give it a very fair and very fair. You've always been loyal to this nation. Now, you finally have a President who is loyal to you. It's taking a long time. Your dreams and my dreams, your hopes or my hopes and your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day.
I'm fighting, I had such an easy life.
People say I had such an easy life, who the hell knew. It was going to be this difficult, but I love it. You know why I love it? Even though we had artificial obstacles put in our path, even though we had phony Russian hoaxes and witch hunts and people that hate Trump and hate you angry Democrats, all after us with all of it, and they still have it's like little embers that are burning, they're going crazy, because when the Mueller report was finished, it said no collusion, they went crazy, but you know what they knew it. They knew it. It's all a game, it's not like they didn't know, they knew there was no collusion.
They're smart people, everyone from shift to Nadler to Schumer to Pelosi, they all knew there was nothing in there. I come to the great state of Pennsylvania and I said, "Oh, I need some help. Let me call, let's see, Russia, let's call Russia." It's the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on this country. From now, until November 3rd, 2020, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning.
That's what we're doing. With every last ounce of heart and hope and sweat and soul. We are going to make our stand and is a tough stand and it's a beautiful stand. We are going to stand for liberty, we are going to stand for justice, we are going to stand for faith, family and freedom. We are going to stand for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God.
We are one united movement, one united people and one United States of America and together we are the proud people of Pennsylvania, a great state, a beautiful state, a tough state. The people are tough and this strong and smart. I know 'em well. I know 'em well. And don't forget Biden deserted you, he's not from Pennsylvania.
I guess he was born here, but he left you, folks. He left you for another state. Remember that, please. I meant to say that. This guy talks about oh, I know Scranton I know that -- Well, I know the places better. He left you for another state and he didn't take care of you because he didn't take care of your jobs.
He let other countries come in and rip off America. That doesn't happen anymore, because we're going to make America wealthy again, we're going to make America strong again, we're going to make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Pennsylvania.
I love this place. Hello, Pittsburgh. Hello, Pittsburgh. You know what? Do me a favor, get out on Tuesday, vote for Rick Saccone, and we can leave right now. Come on. We don't have to spend any time. Great guy.
I'm thrilled to be back in Pennsylvania, where I went to school, went to college with so many hard-working American patriots. You're great people. Great. Pennsylvania is the state that gave us American independence, American freedom, and what else? American steel. American steel. They've been talking a little bit about steel over the last -- little while, haven't they? And we're saving the steel, and a lot of steel mills are now opening up because of what I did.
And not all of my friends on Wall Street loved it. But we love it, because we know what it does. Many plants have just announced over the last few days that they're expanding, opening. Steel is back. It's going to be back to, steel is back, and aluminum is back, gonna be back. And on November 8, Pennsylvania is the state that gave us the 45th President of the United States. And I think we're doing a good job for you. I hope so. We're working hard.
It's not easy. That Washington D.C., it got a lot of evil there, but we're getting it out step by step. A lot of evil, a lot of bad people, a lot of bad people, lot of fake media, look at them. A lot of fake media, fake, fake media.
You know, it's funny, I don't know if you saw it, but we've had a problem for years with North Korea. Fact, President Obama said, it was the biggest problem we had. And South Korea went there. We put very, very strong sanctions and lots of other things we've been doing.
Right from the first day I was in office, and South Korea came to my office after having gone to North Korea and seeing Kim Jong-un, and... no, it's very positive, no. After the meeting you may do that, but now we have to be very nice because, let's see what happens, let's see what happens. So the South Korean top people, top representatives, they walked out -- the White House, to a throng of these characters.
Big, big group, and everybody wanted to find out what happened. Now they just left North Korea and look, North Korea's tough, they're testing nuclear weapons, they're doing a lot of things. A lot of -- this should have been handled by the way, over the last 30 years, not now. That's what it should have been here.
They shouldn't handle it. They should have been handled, and everybody will say it too. But that's okay, because that's what we do, we handle things. And these guys came out and they said that, Your President has done a great job. I might say.
But -- well I'll tell you, we did a great job in the Olympics. President Moon of South Korea said Without Donald Trump, the Olympics would have been a total failure. It's true, so, you know, might as well say it. Nobody else is gonna say it, right? Might as well say it.
Little hard to sell tickets. Would you think you're going to be nuke. But when North Korea called, and they said We'd like to be in the Olympics. Everybody said Let's buy tickets, let's go. I would have gone. And it became a very, very successful Olympics.
Honestly, South Korea did a great job and it was great to see North Korea going and participating, and there was a nice unity. It was really a nice thing. But when the South Korean representatives, who just left North Korea, came outside, big throng of press, they announced that North Korea, Kim Jong-un, would like to meet with President Trump. Now, if this is it, this doesn't happen.
You know, they say Oh well, Obama could have done that. Trust me, he couldn't have done that. He wouldn't have done that. He would not have done it. And by the way, neither would Bush and neither would Clinton, and they had their shot and all they did was nothing. Hey.
Well, Clinton gave away billions and billions of dollars and as soon as they made the deal the following day, they started working on making more nukes okay, so that wasn't. That's not the great deal. Never see the story where I'm -- it's 1999, I'm on Meet the Press, a show now, headed by sleepy eyes, Chuck Todd, he's a sleeping son of a bitch, I'll tell you. And they showed it this morning, 1999 and I'm talking about North Korea.
You got to take them out now and then they have Clinton saying We are pleased to announce that we have made a deal with North Korea. Well, you know how that deal turned out, right? We gave billions and billions of dollars and lots of other things, and we got nothing. But they show me young, handsome. I said Why couldn't I look like that today? I should have run back then, right?
Huh? I should have run back then, I would have done this earlier. So -- but they had me, literally, saying I don't know if anybody's to it . They played a lot but literally saying to a very good guy, actually but saying that we got to do something about North Korea.
That was when it wasn't in vogue and then they have Clinton giving everything away and then they show -- and here we are today with a man -- who's nuked up all over the place. But we've been very strong and very vigilant, and now lots of good things, I think are gonna happen, but we'll see. But the funny thing -- so, they announced that he's not going to send missiles up anymore until through the meetings. Well, think of that, you know, we were losing -- we're getting a lot of missile sent.
I wouldn't say Japan was thrilled, missiles flying over Japan. They're very happy with what I'm doing. And, who else could do it? I mean, honestly, who do you think?
They're not going to send missiles up, think of it. They're not sending missiles up, and I believe that, I believe that, I really do. I think they want to do something. I think they want to make peace, I think it's time. And I think we've shown great strength, I think that's also important, right?
And -- and I must tell you, President Xi of China has really helped us a lot. They've really helped us and because 93% of the goods come in through China going into Korea, North Korea. Ninety-three percent. So, that's pretty powerful, and they've been very good.
They could have done more, but that's okay, I'd say to him You've been great. You could do more. But they've done a lot. They've done more.
China has done more for us than they have ever done for any other President or ever done for this country, and I respect that. I res... 'cause need that. Stopping the flow of goods, it's very important. And we put sanctions on.
So they come out, White House, many of these same characters that I see, I see those faces, I see those faces. And for the first two hours, it was unbelievable. This is amazing. This is incredible.
I can't believe this is happening. You know, because we go from like a lot of people, thought we're going to war and all of a sudden they come in, they say We're gonna have a meeting. And there's no more missiles going off and they want to denuclearize. Nobody had heard that, nobody thought -- but they said they want to -- They are thinking about that. Who knows what's gonna happen?
Hey, who knows? It happens, if it doesn't happen. I may leave fast or we may sit down and make the greatest deal for the world and for all of these countries, including, frankly, North Korea and that's where I hope happens. But the press, for two hours, is going This is fantastic, this is amazing. A certain anchor on CNN, fake as hell CNN, the worst.
Ugh. So fake, fake news. And the ratings are lousy by the way and compared to Fox their ratings. And a certain anchor, female, said This is really something he would go down as a truly great President if this happened. Okay, but all of them is saying This is amazing.
This is incredible. Did you hear what they just said? They just said de-nuke. They just said all of these things. They just said no more missiles.
They said they want to meet with President Trump. It was -- they couldn't believe it. The worst of them CNN, MSNBC, which is -- which is worse than I -- I think I have a new -- MSNBC, third rate, and NBC, which is horrible. Their newscast, by the way, is not doing well on NBC network, they're heading down the tubes.
But -- but listen to this, I did The Apprentice on NBC for 14 seasons. I made a lot of money for them. We had a big successful show. Arnold Schwarzenegger failed when he did The Apprentice and he's a movie star.
Martha Stewart failed when she did The Apprentice, and I just kept chugging along every year was a big hit. I mean, I did The Apprentice, made him a lot of money, gave him good ratings when they were absolutely dying and they did nothing but kill me. NBC is perhaps worse than CNN, I have to tell you. And MSNBC is horrible.
So here they are. They're outside, these wonderful representatives, very high-level from South Korea are saying all of these things de-nuke and all of the things that they can't believe, because it's like five years ahead of schedule. Before this they would say, Well that will never happen, and this will never happen, and you'll never get them for -- Stop. You know, with the missiles.
They're saying all of this. Now they say, they want to stop the missiles, they want to denuclearize. They want to do all of these things, and all of these people are like, they can't believe it. It's unbelievable.
I said to my wife, I said, you know, it's amazing, they're really nice to -- It's really amazing. They're ll saying this is an incredible achievement. This is okay. Then I get up in the morning.
So time goes by, right? Same people, they're, saying Not that big a deal, anybody could have done it. Obama could have done it. Obama had a chance. No, no. They're saying, Obama. Obama. Obama. Obama was driving you down.
You take a look at those numbers before we took over, they were heading down. So, so just let me say, so I wake up. So it's so nice and I'm looking forward to watching in the morning. And I go -- I mean literally, they're saying, Well, Clinton could have met.
Clinton gave away the house. I got nothing. And Bush, Bush, Bush, another great Republican. He got us into the middle east. That was great -- We spent $7 trillion in the middle east over a 17-year period, $7 trillion as of three months ago. Okay. Well, you know, what they did, that was like taking a big stone and throwing it into a hornet's nest, but we're bringing it back. ISIS?
We have 98% of the Caliphate of the land, 98. So I woke up when I saw all these reports that, you know, anybody could have done it. Oh yes, sure. Anybody could have gotten President Xi, President for life. That was another one.
So he's President for life. It happened two days ago. And I was joking. I was at a, a roast actually, but I was joking and I said, Ha, President for life, that sounds good. Maybe we're gonna have to try it. President for life. But I'm joking, but I'm joking. And they knew I was.
Everybody there was laughing, everybody's having a great time, I'm joking about being President for life. A couple of who went back, Donald Trump with his dictatorial attitude. Now wants to be President for life. You know, straight fake news. Fake. Horrible.
But you know what's gonna happen? Did you see the other day, 96% of what they do? All I do is good stuff.The economy is the best it's ever been. You're coal -- By the way, folks, some of you are in the coal world.
Your coal is coming back. Big, big, big, big, your steel is coming back, your steel is coming back. Those plants are going to be opening, and what we've done with the 25% tariffs for those guys that come in and dump their steel all over the place, and by the way, it's not good steel, you guys know what I mean, it's crap. But your steel is coming back. It's all coming back.
And six months prior to the election in 2020, every one of those guys, we really endorsed Donald Trump. We think he has to, and you know why? Because if I don't win the election, their ratings are gonna go so far down, they're gonna be out of business, every one of them. Can you imagine, can you imagine covering Bernie or Pocahontas. Pocahontas? How about that? Pocahontas. Can you imagine these guys?
Some of them were actually smiling, but some of them just can't stand it honestly, some of them they can't take it. Can you imagine having to cover Elizabeth Warren before news? You know, I was watching during the campaign and Hillary was sitting right there and Pocahontas was up and she was so angry. Look. We love each other, the women, the men, we love each other, everybody loves -- She was so angry.
I said, You know, I think she's losing the entire male audience and many of the women. She was going at it and Hillary sitting there saying, Oh, my god, what did I do here? This is -- But can you imagine if they had to cover some of these people that are running, I think any of them to be honest with you, I think any of them. Oh, I'd love Oprah to win, I'd love to beat Oprah. I know her weakness. No, no, I know her weakness. I -- I'd know her.
You know, I know her very well. I was on her last show, were one of the last -- I guess the last week, she had Donald Trump and Donald Trump's family, my-my-my, we've come down a long way, haven't we? I'm now President, and probably, you know, but -- but think of it. I know her weakness. Wouldn't we love to run against Oprah? I would love it. I would love it. That would be a painful experience for her. So we've created three million. Thank you, darling.
Oh, they're positive. I thought they were negative, they're positive. That's always the problem. We have a room that's packed, if we have one person, and that's actually a fan, by the way, that's a fan over there, folks. But if we have one person that speaks it, it's like a big deal the next day, so we've created three million jobs since Election day, nobody thought that was possible. [Applause]
We passed the largest tax cuts and reform in American history. We've created more than 300,000 new jobs alone last month, and you saw the numbers yesterday. Yesterday's numbers job reports was among the best numbers ever produced in the history of our country, in the history of our country. In fact, my guys, [Cheering] in fact, my guys, came into my office and they gave me the number because, if you add the previous month, which was adjusted upward by 52,000 jobs, they were low last month. It adjusted upward.
So we're like over 360,000 jobs, and I said, Let me ask you, is that a mistake? I don't think I've ever s -- You know if you get 160, it's good. We were at 360, so I looked at my guys, I said, Is that a type of graphical error, what is that? But you saw it, was one of the best reports, and you know the amazing thing? Wages went up a little bit, you haven't had wages in 19 years. Wages are starting to go up. Think of it. Wages. I mean, how good is that?
Wages starting to go up. African-American unemployment has reached the lowest level in history. The lowest. You know, African-American -- and I'm very proud of that.
African-American unemployment, two months ago reached the lowest level in history and then last month that went up a little bit, right? And I made the mistake because I didn't know it went up and it wasn't quite as good, but it wasn't historic. So, I was in a different month and I said African unemployment is the lowest level in history. They killed me, because it was the previous month, but here's the good news the new month brought it down to the lowest level. So now it's a lowest level. [Cheering]
Hispanic unemployment is the lowest level. Think of that. Hispanic unemployment is the lowest level in history. Women, women, we love you, we love you.
Hey, didn't we surprise them with women during the election. Remember? Women won't like Donald Trump. I said, Have I really had that kind of a problem? I don't think so. But, Women won't like Donald Trump.
It will be a rough night for Donald Trump because the women won't come out. We got 52%, right? Fifty-two, right? And I'm running against a woman. You know, that's not that easy.
A hundred and fifty-five million people are now employed that is, came out this morning, that is the highest level of employment in the history of our country, 155 million, think of that, right? [Cheering] While the Obama administration in its final year was losing 1,000 manufacturing jobs a month. We've created almost 300,000 new manufacturing jobs. Think of that.
Think of that. The tasks for all of us, for everyone here tonight, is to make sure that this great American comeback continues full speed ahead. [Applause] We are doing things that are amazing. You know, Make America Great Again, right?
Make America Great Again, right? So you know what the new slogan is gonna be? I won't tell you, we've got to keep it secret, except did you ever see so much press? Wow.
You know what the new slogan will be? Because I can't use it in three years from now. I can't say -- Very good. I can't use it. I can't go like, in four years and say, Here's my slogan., which is now two and a half years, we'll have to start thinking right.
It's getting close, we can't say, Make America Great Again. cause I already did that, right? Right? So, right? So our, not my slogan, our slogan, this is a team. Our new slogan will be -- and you know this is on the assumption that happens, which I'm almost positive, can never be 100% sure.
I never like to go too far in advance, but let's assume it's going like it's going, by the way, if we coasted for two and a half years we did a hell of a job. You know that. Fact I was telling some of the guys, let's just coast, because the stock market is up almost 40% since election day, think of that. Almost 40%.
Think of that. And by the way that's not rich people, that's for everybody. I mean, you have your 401ks, which are up 42%, 38%, I tell it all the time. I take pictures back with the policemen. I love the policemen, I love the firemen, they're great.
Alright, and they're always coming up and saying, Sir, thank you very much. My 401k is up 41%. My wife thinks I'm a genius. They think like they're great investors, okay. But they're up way, way up, and that's good. That's really good. That's what we want. That's what we want. That's what we have to have. We're so proud of this country.
But our new slogan, when we start running in -- can you believe it two years from now? is going to be Keep America Great. Exclamation point. Keep America Great. But we can only do that if we elect people who are going to back our agenda and fight for our values, and that is why we have to defeat Nancy Pelosi [Cheering] and Maxine Waters, a very low IQ individual.
Do you ever see her? You never seen a -- you ever see her? We will impeach him, we will impeach the press, but he hasn't done anything wrong. It doesn't matter, we will impeach him, she's a low IQ individual.
You can't help her, too early. We will impeach her. But you have Maxine Waters and you have plenty of others. And I mean, Nancy Pelosi, you can't have that. And Conor Lamb Lamb the Sham, right? Lamb the Sham, he's trying to act like a Republican, so he gets -- he won't give me one vote. Look, I don't know him, looks like a nice guy. I hear he's nice-looking. I think I'm better looking than him. I do, I do, I do.
And he's slightly younger than me, slightly. No, I heard that, then I saw, he's OK. He's alright. Personally, I like Rick Saccone, and I think he's handsome. [Cheering]
And you did a great job on television today. I watched you, Rick. That was a great interview. That was a great interview. I appreciate it too, but he's really good.
Here's the thing, we're dealing with people that want to obstruct. They want to stop us from doing things. We put an infrastructure bill in for $1.7 billion, and I hear they want to stop it. They want to stop DACA. DACA is their issue, but I'm willing to go along, get it done.
We've got to get it done, right? Get it done, and besides that, you know, honestly, we need good great workers in our country, because I'm bringing a lot of companies into this country. We're not gonna have workers for it. We have to bring them in, but DACA they're here, they're good people, and the Democrats are trying to not do so.
I offered a deal that was so good, you can't refuse, right? Like the mob pictures. I'll give you a deal that's so good, you can't refuse. I made a deal, I gave them a deal so good, they could not refuse. And I did it because I thought they were gonna refuse, and they did, and they're getting killed now by the DACA recipients.
They're getting killed. But somebody like Lamb, he's never gonna vote for us. He's now saying -- and I appreciate his nice words about me -- this -- is Trump country, right, so he has to say nice. Okay.
He's smart, so he's saying nice things. Here's the problem, as soon as he gets in, he's not gonna vote for us, he's gonna vote the party line he has to. And if he doesn't he's never going to a chairman of a committee, he's now, you know, it's a whole crazy system, but he's going to vote the party line. He doesn't care about us, but for getting your votes he's talking about how much he likes tariffs, which is my baby, and I took a lot of heat over that.
But let me tell you all, these countries now are calling up, We don't want the tariffs. What do we have to do? European Union, they kill us. Sounds good. A lot of us came from the European Union, different countries, right? Sounds nice.
They kill us on trade, so we put on tariffs and the European Union's out there well we're gonna put, I said you can't go any higher than you are anyway, and they have trade barriers. We can't even sell our farming goods in there, they totally restrict us.
So then they say, We want those tariffs taken off. I said, Good. Open up the barriers and get rid of your tariffs, and if you don't do that, we're gonna tax, Mercedes-Benz, we're gonna tax BMW. You want to have money, we want to have money, come into our country, and you know the cars are really the big item. That's the big money item.
So when I said that all of a sudden, it's like whoa, let's stop talking with this guy. You know, with the European Union were like $100 billion down because we had stupid politicians doing so pathetic, right?
A hundred, think of 100 billion, by the way, we're really -- I've always said 71 billion, but Mexico were 130 billion. That's a real number because nobody includes the VAT tax. Nobody even knows what about taxes, but Mexico charges a 16% VAT tax. So nobody ever talks about it. You know they'd do it.
That deal was bad the day they made it because they had a tax and we didn't. So they have a 16% VAT tax. Nobody ever talks about it, but I talk about it. So we're either going to renegotiate NAFTA, and I said, we won't put the tariffs on Mexico and Canada and Canada's brutal, Canada's really tough. They, you know, we have a big deficit with Canada too.
They send in timber, they send in steel. They send in a lot of things, but our farmers in Wisconsin are not treated well when we want to send things to them. Hey, and I don't blame them. Why should I blame them? Because they just out-smarted our politicians for decades and I don't mean Obama.
I mean all of them. Since Bush the first, and that includes, I mean, that includes a lot of territory. Frankly, Ronald Reagan, you remember, I didn't love his -- I thought he was great. I loved his style, his attitude.
He was a great cheerleader for our count -- you know, for the country, but not great on the trade. For many, many years, they've been -- that's where they -- you know. We used to be a nation of tariffs. When other countries would come to the United States, they had a pay for the privilege of taking our product, of taking our jobs. They had a pay, they wanted to come in and sell their product, they had a pay.
Today, in China, they sell a car to us, they paid 2.5%. We sell a car in China, which by the way, is almost impossible to do despite the tax, it's 25 %. So why is that 25 and we're 2.5? And that's why we have a trade deficit with China of $500 billion a year? It's no good, but we're changing it and it takes a little while.
I'm there a year, a little more than a year, we're changing. [Cheering] We have to. We have a trade deficit. We have a trade deficit with all countries of the world. Listen to this number, if there's any children in the room, please close your ears.
We have a trade deficit of almost $800 billion a year. Now, who makes these deals? So with Mexico -- he says Obama, [Crowd laughing] Honestly, in all fairness to Obama, it's more than Obama, it's plenty of people, believe me. Plenty of Presidents allowed that to happen, and people that work for the President, so we're gonna get a lot of things straightened away.
NAFTA is under work right now, and I think they're going to be very good. And you saw what I did with the tariffs. They said, We don't want to pay tariffs. I said, Let's make a deal on NAFTA. And if you make a decent deal, a fair deal for the American worker, the American people. We will. You have no problem with the tariffs.
I said the same thing to the European Union. I said, Look, you're killing us we're losing $100 billion a year. You're not accepting our product. They're not accepting our farm product. I want to help the farmers, and they don't accept it.
And I said, Open up your countries. That's countries, they banded together. Why did they band together? To screw the United States on trade, and that's okay, they're allowed, you know, actually here would be called the monopoly, it wouldn't be allowed. But all those countries got together in order to do well on trade with the United States.
People don't know that. You know, you hear European Union sounds, Oh, the European Union, sounds so innocent. It's not innocent, they're very tough, they're very smart. Where there's $100 billion a year. They sell stuff into us.
We charge them practically, nothing. We sell things into them, no.1. You can't get it through the barriers, they have artificial barriers. That's not a monetary barrier, that's other things, environmental. They come up with things you wouldn't even believe.
But we can't get our product in there. So I said, Open up your barriers, get rid of your tariffs and we'll do this. We'll have a nice, fair, open -- and if you don't do that, that's okay. And that's where the cars come in. So, we have a lot of work to do. But I need people that can help me and this guy can really help me. [Cheering]
This guy can really help me, [Cheering] Rick Saccone, and I've got him too and he's got a tough race and he's got a tough race. I think we won by 22 points, and Rick, you know, look it's a crazy time out there, it's crazy, but I think the Republicans. You know you never hear this. So, I've been -- in fact, I think she's here, Karen Handel, where's Karen, was she here? She was here.
Where is she? Did I do a good job, huh, in Atlanta? So, Karen, is this sort of like, around this Karen was down, she started off with a whole group of people. It's a little different voting. She had running for Congress in Atlanta, the Atlanta area, right?
So they had a guy, a young guy who spent $34 million. That's still the old time world record, right? Running to be a congressman. They make 150,000 bucks a year. He spent 34 million.
There's something going on, right? So Ka-, I didn't know you were here. Somebody said you may be here, that's so great, Karen. So Karen was running with many Republicans. It was like 14, 13 Republicans, which is crazy and Karen was the one I wanted.
But that's a lot of Republicans. So Karen ended up with about 14 or 15. This guy ended. He was 58, 58, which meant he would have won the election, there was no more runoff, right?
And we came after him, right? We came after that guy and we found out a couple of like, minor things. He didn't live in the district. I heard.
They said, Sir, he doesn't live in the district, but nobody cares about that or said really, let's try it on the voter. So, anyway, you have to get 50, in which case the elections over. If you get less than 50, you have a runoff and you take the top two. So Karen was fantastic, but she was with so many Republicans and he was essentially the only Democrat. So I brought him down, in a period of four days, I got no credit for this from these guys, brought him down from 58 to 48.
So now he's in a runoff with Karen, so think of it he's at 48 she's at 15. By the time Karen and I finished with this guy, 32 million he spent, and she spent slightly less than that. Okay, she spent like like about 29 million less, right. She spent 29 million less, but by the time we finished, the winner, easily by 5 points, was Karen Handel. [Cheering].
And they love the job she's doing, and I think you're gonna have a good victory now, but the people have gotten to know you and they love you in your area and hope I don't have to go and make speeches all over the place like last night. But we need Karen, and we need, we need our Congressman Saccone. We have to have him. [Cheering]. We have to happen.
Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, the only chance she's got to become Speaker, is electing Democrats, and you know what, we don't have a big margin. It's just a very small. If you -- I mean, they're doing a number in your state. You see what they're doing with the congressional districts, they're doing a number, and hopefully the United States Supreme Court will take that case, because this is horrible what they've done. They had state judges that are Democrats, change your voting districts.
What kind of stuff is that? What kind of stuff? And it's gonna make it very hard for Republicans that are great Republicans that would easily win, and now it's all changed and it's very unfair. Let's see what happens. It's litigation, it's in court.
Let's see what happens, but it's very unfair. The people of Pittsburgh cannot be conned by this guy Lamb. You just can't do it because he's -- again, he's never gonna vote for us. He can say, I love President Trump. I agree with everything he says. You know what, I don't want to meet him, because anybody that says that, I might like him and then Rick is gonna, be very angry at me, right?
No, he's going around saying it, but he's not gonna do that stuff. He's not gonna do it. There's no way he's going for the things? That is what he says, I'm not gonna vote for Pelosi. He's not.
Now that could be possible, but most people are, most people are, but he says he's not going to do that. He's going to do this to steel, he's going to do that here. Well, the Democrats are opposed to those things. He's weak on crime, he's weak on the border, he's weak on the Second Amendment, but all of a sudden he got strong, and by the way, in terms of abortion, take a look at his record. Take a look.
It's amazing he's come back, oh well, take a look at his record, because where his record is, that's where he's going. So Pelosi's party in Congress is full of people, who tell their voters one thing during the election and they go to Washington and vote lockstep.
You know the one thing I noticed about them and I've been there now for 14 months, 14 months. Can you be -- but have we done a lot? Yeah. A lot of stuff. [Cheering] We have done more than any first-term administration in the history of our country, we have. You take a look at what we're going. Regulation, tax cuts, federal judges, a great, great Supreme Court justice corps. Great.
Look what we've done. Look what we've done. And you know what, we passed the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. Didn't get one Democrat vote, didn't get one, and by the way, how good is that kicking in, remember? Remember? We passed it. We didn't get one Democrat vote, think of that. Not one.
And now they're all, a little, they get a little nervous, that's okay. But we didn't get one, and you know what helped? When AT&T and the big companies came, they started paying thousands and thousands of dollars in bonuses to, you know, millions of people, I think it's up to five million people now, and that was not in the schedule, but they're paying the money out and the people are getting the money, and I'll tell you what, we're so proud of that. But we also got rid of the individual mandate from Obamacare, which basically guts out Obamacare.
That'll be next. That'll be next. That's where you pay a lot of money for the privilege of not getting health care. Okay?
How do you like that one? How that one made it through court, I will not made it through twice. But you pay a lot of money for the privilege, so we got rid of the individual mandate. Nobody even talks about because the tax bill is so massive, bigger than Reagan and bigger than -- biggest one ever done, and you know they were calling a tax reform. This is where a non-politician like me is good, because they had a name and for 40 years they couldn't pass anything, and I kept saying, How is it possible not to pass tax cuts?
Sir, I don't know, we just can't pass. It's been Reagan was the last one that did a big bill and we just can't pass. I said, Well, what's the problem? Well, sir, the tax reform is not easy. I said, Wait a moment, do you call a tax reform, or do you call it tax cuts? [Cheering] Then he said -- Right? and he said, No, sir. We call it tax reform because we're doing a lot of reforming. I said, Look, people don't know what reform means.
Neither do I. People want tax cuts, they don't know, they don't know. They want tax cuts. [Cheering] They want tax cuts and honestly the word reform, it could mean you're gonna triple your taxes, we're gonna reform taxes and trip -- I said, Nobody knows what it means. It could be really bad. So they said, You know, we never thought if this after 40 years. Nobody ever thought of it.
So they said, Could you come up with the name? And I did. You know what it was called? The tax cut, cut, cut cut bill. But I must tell you, and on this I think they were right, the politicians thought that was a little hokey, so we call it the Tax US Tax Cut and Jobs bill, which is nice, which is nice.
And we got it passed. We had unanimous, unanimous in the Republican Party and unanimous for the Democrats and by the way, you're gonna have a great man running as a Republican for the Senate.
While we're here, Rick, we should say it, right? Sweet Lou, right? He's going to be great, he's got a chance. He is, he is with you all the way, he loves this state.
He loves the people and will be out fighting for him very, very hard. Okay, you know who that is, you know, but he's going to be running and he's good, he's running already, he's running very hard, he's going to be fantastic. So we passed the tax cuts. We didn't have one Democrat vote, I think of that. So I think they can have a problem.
Now, historically, after a Presidential election, the other side, like always wins, and I've told you, you've heard the story. Because people become complacent, you had a victory. You elected your President, you like you, but you like me. I think so, right? [Cheering]
I like you too, I love you, I love you, I love you. So, is there any more fun than at a Trump rally? You know a lot of times I have to do like reading as well pass an environmental bill and they want me to go to -- a I'm very spoiled, you know, if I go to a small place and they have 2,000 people. It's like, why don't we open a stadium or something, you know we're spoiled.
Other guys, they go out, they get 50 people, they're satisfied. We need crowds like this. In fact, the fire marshal was fantastic. You know they had a lot of people out, and he's a great guy. Don't want to get him in trouble, but he opened up those doors and he's got guys saying, and he let, most of the people that were for -- you know they were sent away.
He got a look at those corners now those cameras are never going to cover those corners they're, never going to cover the corner, they're never going to cover. They never show the crowds they never like to show the crowd, ever. You know, the only thing is the noise, because you can't imitate it. It sounds like a Penn State football game, it sounds like an Ohio State football game, right? You can't.
I'll say to friends, I'll say to friends, did you see my speech last night? Yes, then, the first I have to say, How good was I? How good? and they say, Good. I said, Did they show the crowd? No they didn't., he said, But you know what, I could tell by the noise that crowd was really big. You can't hide that, you can't hide that. [Cheering] So good.
The Democrats are the party of sanctuary cities, explain that one, right? [Crowd booing] They like to protect criminals, they like to protect MS-13. These are -- the this is the party of -- So how about that? How about that? How about ice? These ice guys are tough as hell, they go in and they're not playing games.
You know, the only thing I hate to say this, not so politically correct, but the only thing these gang members understand is toughness, I hate to say. They're, not interested in genius. They're not interested, they're interested in somebody that's tougher than them. That's what -- and we have the toughest people you've ever seen and they went out to Long Island and they grabbed them by the neck and they throw them into the paddy when we're cleaning out, we're doing it. [Cheering] We are building the wall under this.
A hundred percent, 100%. You know the President of Mexico, who I think is a really nice guy, because you know it's been, Build a Wall, and I can't get through a speech without somebody, because I was all set to say, Build the Wall, and then these guys start screaming, build a wall, well we're building it. But the President of Mexico calls -- and you know, I told you we're in the midst of negotiating NAFTA. So we have a little sticking point.
He called up and respectfully, because he really is a high quality guy and he called up, he goes, Mr. President, we would like you to make a statement that Mexico will not pay for the wall. I said, Are you crazy? You think I'm gonna make -- I'm not making that statement. He said, Well, you have to. I said, Is it a deal breaker? He said, Yes. I said, Bye-bye.
We're not making a deal. There's no way I'm making it. Now what I will say, and what I told him is, President, don't worry, it all comes out in the wash we're gonna put it into the NAFTA agreement. Nobody's gonna be talking too much about it. It'll be park -- We're gonna make a much better than what we have to, we have to. When we lose $130 billion with Mexico. I think we can do a little better than that, right? The wall, you know what the wall is?
It's this, you don't even notice. It's like a little asterisk on the bottom, okay, so he said to me that, and I said, No, I think we can't do that. We actually broke it up. He was going to come to Washington no way. I'm gonna say anything like that, but I will say we will build a wall, we have to build a wall, we have to build a wall, and the Democrats are holding it back. You know we had a deal 25 billion, and by the way, if I get 25 billion for the wall, you can have a lot of change.
You're gonna have a lot of change. I've got -- I've, got all the big builders, the best ones in the world. I know the best builders, you know we want to use the good builders, not the bad ones. Save a lot of money on the airplanes. We save a lot of money on Air Force One, $1.4 billion we said.
One point four, still too expensive, it's crazy. It's crazy. But we saved a lot of money. I got Boeing in and we had a talk and we said that we saved $1.4 billion, okay.
I mean that's worth a 10-minute meeting right. I don't care how big the United States is, but we're gonna build the wall and we have to build the wall for people, for gangs, for drugs. The drugs has never been a problem like we have right now. And by the way, like the world has with drugs, and you know what, we fill up these councils, they all want to be on councils, they call them Blue Ribbon councils, where we take Melania, great, great first lady, we take -- she's great, she is great. You think her life is so easy, folks?
Not so easy. She is a great first la-, but we put Melania and other people on this blue-ribbon committee. Do you think the drug dealers that kill thousands of people during their lifetime, do you think they care who's on a blue-ribbon committee? The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness. When you catch a drug dealer, you got a, you gotta put him away for a long time.
When I was in China, and other places by the way, I said, Mr. President, do you have a drug problem? No, no. no. We do not. I said Huh, big country. 1.4 billion people, right? Not much of a drug problem.
I said, What do you tribute that to? Well, the death penalty. True. Hey, if you're a drug dealer, and you know you're gonna get caught, and you know that you're gonna kill people, you're killing our kids, they're killing our kids, they're killing our kids, they're killing our families, they're killing our workers. You know, we have a hard time of the 100 million people, that special group of people, they're great people.
They want to work. We have a hard time. A lot of them can't qualify to work in these factories. Chrysler's coming back in, you saw that from Mexico to Michigan, you have -- We have companies coming back into the United States. You haven't seen that. I used tell you that was going to happen, but now it's happening. But a problem, a lot of people can't qualify because of drugs, but I said to the President, I said so, You don't have much of a problem. No.
And they had a problem. You know, if you go back 200 years ago and they know all about drugs. It was devastating to China, the opium, devastating, it destroyed China and I'm not gonna let it destroy us. And there was an article in one of the main papers.
Maybe it was the failing New York Times, is one of them. And I don't even know where they get it because, honestly, I don't know that the United States, frankly, is ready for it. They should be ready for, but at a minimum you have to give long tough sentences. But if you go to Singapore, I said, Mr. President, what happens with your drugs? No, we don't have a problem, President. I said, Really, why? We have a zero-tolerance. And he's not playing games. These guys don't play games.
You know, we have a different type of people. They don't play games. I said, How you doing on drugs? No problem. Said, What do you mean no problem? And that's entertainment. You know, a lot of things are happening. So what do you mean no problem? We have a zero-tolerance policy.
What does that mean? That means if we catch a drug dealer, death penalty, that's it. [Cheering] And they don't have a problem. Now, remember this.
If somebody goes and shoot somebody or kill somebody, they go away for life and they can even get the death penalty, right. One person. They shoot one person they get the death penalty, they shoot, one person kill some person, knife one person, the person dies, they get maybe the death penalty, or maybe life in prison, no parole, right. Okay. A drug dealer will kill 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 people during the course of his or her life.
Thousands of people are killed or their lives are destroyed, their families are destroyed, so you can kill thousands of people and go to jail for 30 days. They catch your drug dealer. They don't even put him in jail. Think of it, you kill one person, you get the death penalty in many states or you get life imprisonment. You think of it.
You kill 5,000 people with drugs because you're smuggling them in and you make it a lot of money and people are dying and they don't even put you in jail. They don't do anything, but you might get 30 days 60 days 90 days. You might get a year, but you're not gonna get, and then you wonder why we have a problem. That's why we have a problem, folks. [Applause] And I don't think, I don't think we should play games now.
I never did polling on that. I don't know if that's popular, I don't know if that's unpopular, probably you'll have some people. That say, Oh, that's, not nice, but -- but these people are killing our kids and they're killing our families and we have to do something. We can't just keep setting up, blue-ribbon committees, with your wife and your wife and your husband and they meet and they have a meal and they talk, talk, talk, talk, two hours later, then they write a report said, look, that's what I got in Washington.
I got all these blue-ribbon committees. Everybody wants to be blue-ribbon, and we the opioid problem, and for that, we have to go after the drug companies, we have to, we have no choice.
We have to go after the drug companies, [Cheering] we have no choice. So, so I think it's a discussion we have to start thinking about, don't you agree? I don't know if you're ready, I don't know if this country is ready for it, but I think, Rick, I think it's a discussion that we have to start thinking about.
So in Oakland you have a mayor [Crowd booing] and she -- and she told people that we're going to be captured in a big ray, that there's going to be a ray, can't do it, you can't do it, folks, we've got to get smart. My administration believes our cities should be safe havens for American people, not for American criminals, okay, not for American criminals. [Cheering]
We're going after violent criminals and we're going after vicious gang members. These are so -- these people is so tough, but you know, we had our ICE agents out in Long Island. Can you imagine? I grew up like around in Queens in New York, which is sort of, but I knew, Long Island, well now, it's sort of like on the way, right. And places that I know so well, I loaded up with MS-13.
Well, your daughter walks home, and they don't use guns, you never sell guns. The NRA happens to be very good people, by the way, they want to do the right thing, [Cheering] but they don't use them. They don't use guns, they like to use knives and other things, because it's much more painful, it's much slower, it's much --
These are animals and we send these guys out and we liberate those towns. We liberate them. Hillary wouldn't have liberated those towns, we liberate those towns and the people are cheering it's like a war. It's like if you got liberated as a country.
Can you imagine this is taking place in our country? It's crazy. So we are doing a great, great job. We are loving it, we're making tremendous progress.
Today, I'm calling on Congress to stop funding sanctuary cities, [Cheering] so we can save American life. [Applause] The funding bill should not give precious and massive taxpayer grants to cities aiding and abetting criminals. That's what they do. Look at the stories, Kate, and so many, look at the stories how horrible they are.
I'm also calling on Congress to finally end chain migration and cancel the very dangerous VISA lottery now they're probably, again, the Democrats want to obstruct, so we're probably going to have to wait till after the election, we'll get Rick in there and we'll get some other people in there and we'll be able to get it passed, because these guys don't want to do anything, they don't want to do anything.
You know they criticize, because we have vacancies in certain administrative offices. We have 270 people that we cannot get the Democrats to approve to come in and work in our administration.
They're out there. We have the Ambassador from Germany, and I take heat. These guys are always saying, Well, you don't have an ambassador. Because the Democrats won't approve them, they obstruct, they delay, they do everything they can and that's all they're good at. They have no ideas, they have no ideas.
I mean, I look forward, I really do. I look forward to 2020 because I want to see how far left the person is going to be that we're going to run against. I look forward to it. I look forward to it. [Cheering] I really do. I really do. So together with your help, your voice, your vote. We could achieve more than anybody.
I mean again. I really believe -- and I'm not saying this as braggadocious, because I tell you if we didn't, but the tax bill, when we got the individual mandate, but we also got ANWR, most people don't know what that's one of the biggest feels in the world. We got it approved. They've been trying to approve it for 40 years. That was a part of the textbook.
That alone would have been a massive thing to approve. It got ANWR in Alaska, one of the biggest fields in the world that will start working, and other things. So as long as we're proud of who we are and what we're fighting for, there is nothing beyond our reach, nothing, we need Republicans put in office. We need Senate, and I think we're going to do pretty well with the Senate. You know the numbers are looking pretty good.
Did you see the numbers from about two months ago? And you see the numbers now it's like from a different world, because people are seeing what we're doing, they're seeing what we're doing. We stand on the shoulders of Patriots, who poured out their sweat and blood and tears, and we're going to do things that nobody's been able to do? You know it's very funny.
Every time I go out to speak, we have these massive crowds and you know how many people thousands were turned away. We let thousands in, but thousands were turned away, and I read one woman in the Wall Street Journal today, nice woman, I like her actually, Peggy Noonan, and she wrote an article about me and you know I went to the Wharton School of Finance.
Nice student, that's a very smart. You know, Ivy League school, great, the best Business School, I think, it's one of the hardest schools, to even in my day, I mean, I went to the Wharton School did great, and then you got to read how we're like, like, Is Trump a good speaker? She's talking about, he uses a language, that you know.
You know how easy, remember I used to how easy it is to be Presidential, but you'd all be out of here right now, but you'd be so bored, because I could stand out, right. [Cheering].
I'm very Presidential, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here tonight. Rick Saccone will be a great, great Congressman. He will help me very much he's a fine man and young as a wonderful wife. I just want to tell you, on behalf of the United States of America, that we appreciate your service. We appreciate your service. [Cheering]
And to all of the military out there, we respect you very much. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] And then you go, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
Thank you very much. [Cheering] See that's easy, that's much easier than doing what I have to do because, but this is much more effective. Don't forget this kind of selected. If I came like a stiff, you guys wouldn't be here tonight, so I'm reading, Peggy Noonan, and she's a nice woman.
I like her. She doesn't like me much but and she's writing, like I'm some kind of a Neanderthal, and I'm saying, you know, I'm really smart, you know it's funny, they always talk. They always talk about how they're telling us, they said we couldn't get elected. I say We. because you guys came from areas -- Some of you never voted before, but you love the country. You never voted before, but you love the country.
A great congressman from Tennessee they vote early, and the voting gets started and he was at a speech I was making in Pennsylvania, believe it or not, but he was there 'cause one of his friends, and it was Lou, but one of his friends was there.
So I didn't know him, and they had early voting in Tennessee, and he said, You know, Mr. President... and at that time I wasn't President, but he called me that, because he saw it was happening, he said, In Tennessee the early voting started and I've been doing this stuff for 32 years and I've never seen anything like it in my life. Those people are coming out of the hills. They're coming out of the valleys.
They're coming out of everything that you can come out of. It's the most amazing thing, and these are people that love the country, but they never voted because they never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. And now they've got Trump, Trump, Trump Pence. They've got all this stuff, so I've never seen anything like it. [Cheering] And then they ask, Is he a good speaker? I don't know.
Look. I don't know if I'm a good speaker, but you know what every time I have a 25,000 seat stadium, we fill it up, so something has -- it has to be right. Maybe it's just pure ideas. I don't know, it's hard.
Oh, I love that guy. He said it's hard, we all have heart, but this man, great guy, great congressman, actually. He said, All these years, I've never seen anything like it. He said, and I can only tell you -- I love the state of Tennessee, but I can only tell you if the rest of the countries like Tennessee you're, going to win this damn election and it's going to be easy and we got 306 to 223.
Remember they said, 270, you cannot -- remember the famous 270, he cannot win the election because he cannot get above 270. We needed 270. In fact, they couldn't get me to 270, 69, so we had 269.
They said, He cannot win. He cannot get. Remember? To 270. And we didn't, we got to 306. [Cheering] But remember Pennsylvania, remember Pennsyl -- That was really terrible, so yeah, I've never done this before you know, I did -- I ran for President, never did it before.
Somebody said you know I've been running for the Senate like six times he said you ran for President, you won. What happened is Pennsylvania, remember that night? So we were one point away. We were at 99% of the vote was tabulated right, remember that? 99 and if I lost 10 points we would've win it.
Would there was no way you could lose because we were winning by thousands and thousands of votes, and one point doesn't have all of those thousands of votes. They wouldn't call Pennsylvania, they refused to call it, remember? and I wanted to win. I wanted to win with Pennsylvania was so befitting, because they had spent ten times more in the state of Pennsylvania than I did ten times more, and I'm waiting for Pennsylvania, I'm saying, Come on, Pennsylvania, go one point and I win and I have thousands more votes than I need. In other words, if every single person of the remainder voted against me, we win easily, they wouldn't call it, and then what happened.
Wisconsin came in, we won with Wisconsin, which hadn't been won in decades and then we won with Michigan and then finally they were devastated. You see that we're crying 1-1, crying, she's crying. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, remember John King with the board? I do this every once at the board.
The red board is all red. It's like red man. That board was red, meaning Republican and John King, He can't believe it. He goes, I think he just won the State of Florida. Yes, Donald Trump won the state of Florida's got off. Then they go.
You had to run. You know the electoral college is much harder than the popular vote, because popular vote you go to three or four states, electoral college, you have to go to like nineteen. I was all over the place. I went to Maine, four times, because I needed one vote. They had one vote, that was going to be 269 to 270.
The one vote was going to be very important, so I went to Maine like four times, that's a lot. Because I nodded, if a lot of people said: why are you doing? First of all, I like the people of Maine, but I needed one, but what happened was an incredible -- it was an incredible evening, one of the greatest nights in the history of television, in terms of numbers of people watching, and we have done a job. So here's what this is going to happen.
Let me give you the bad news. The bad news is, they want to take it away from us. They want to take it away, they're doing everything they can to take it away, and that starts with the election coming up in a few months and we have to win it. We have to get out and we have to win. Normally, I would not come except it's Pennsylvania, say I love it anyways, I love the people, I mean, I went to school, I went to Wharton, I went to school here.
I love Pennsylvania. I mean look, how can I not love it, right? Somebody else would show up here and then honestly, Rick, would it be 50, 60 people in front, right? First of all, you wouldn't have this you'd have a little place, but I love this state, but I really feel strongly about Rick Saccone, and I know him. I feel strongly about him.
He's an incredible guy. Number 1, and I don't know that this is important, but to me it is, he's a very fine human being, he's a good person. He's really a good person. Rick, come up here. [Cheering] He's a really good person. [Applause]
So he's a good person, I don't know if that means, that does that mean anything? He's a very, he's a very competent person, he's a very hard worker. He knows things that many people don't know. He understands North Korea, maybe better than anybody. I spoke to him about North Korea.
He was there for a long time and I spoke to him about North Korea and I'm telling you, I learned things that all of these great geniuses, all of these great experts on North Korea did not tell me. This is a very extraordinary guy. We need him, we need Republicans, we need the votes, otherwise, they're gonna take away your taxes, your tax cuts, they're gonna take away your Second Amendment rights. [Crowd booing]
True. They're gonna take away, you know, in the military big big military place, we just got approved $700 billion. We have to rebuild our military, $700 billion, far more than the other party.
They'll take that away too. Our military was really depleted, but I just want to know. I want you to know, I came tonight because this guy is special and beyond the vote, it's very important. Remember this, the other opponent, his opponent is not voting for us. He can say all he wants, is no way he's voting for us, ever, ever.
End he could be nice to me, and he is, but there's no way he's ever voting for me. Rick is gonna vote for us all the time, all the time. [Cheering] So... So I want to ask Rick to say a few words and -- and again, it's an honor to be with you, go out on Tuesday and just vote like crazy.
You got to get out there. The world is watching. This -- I hate to put this pressure on you, Rick, they're, all watching, because I won this district like by 22 points. It's a lot.
That's why I'm here, look at all those red hats, Rick. Look. Look at all those hats. That's a lot of hats. And we just had a poll, we're more popular now than we were on election day.
This guy should win easily and he's gonna win easily. You got to know him, he's an extraordinary person. Go out and vote on Tuesday for Rick Saccone. Rick, go ahead. [Applause]
Do we love our President here in western Pennsylvania? [Cheering] Yeah? Oh, we do. We do.
Let him hear it. Let him hear it, through those cameras. [Applause] They probably turned the volume down, they didn't hear ya. I'll just say a couple words.
You already heard me speak earlier. I want to thank President Trump. As I said before, if President Trump's in your corner, how can you lose? He's the best man you could ask -- anyone could ask to be in your corner. [Cheering]
As any good businessman knows, as any good businessman knows, you work on the deal, you work on the deal. There comes a time to close the deal. This is the time to close the deal. We got two days left. Are you gonna help me on Tuesday? [Cheering] Let's close this deal. [Cheering]
So again, with that we'll say, goodnight, but again go out vote for Rick. He'll never, ever disappoint you. He's a winner. He's never going to disappoint you.
Just go out vote with your hearts, vote with your brains. This is an extraordinary man. I'm gonna be home. Watching that returns, and I hope that I have to make a call on Tuesday night, where I speak to you and young, and I say great job, great race, the whole world, remember that, they're all watching. We want to keep it going.
We want to keep the agenda the Make America Great going, you got to get them in. This is a very important race, very important. Thank you. All god bless you. We love you all. Thank you. Thank you very much. God bless you. [Cheering]
Hello, Wisconsin. This is a great state. I am thrilled to be back with the thousands of loyal, hard-working American patriots who, by the way, gave President Trump a win. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Incredible people. I want to begin tonight's rally by addressing the suspicious devices and packages that were mailed to current and former high-ranking government officials.
My highest duty, as you know, as president is to keep America safe. That's what we talk about. That's what we do. The federal government is conducting an aggressive investigation, and we will find those responsible, and we will bring them to justice, hopefully very quickly. Any acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our democracy itself.
No nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation, coercion, or control. We all know that. Such conduct must be fiercely opposed and firmly prosecuted. We want all sides to come together in peace and harmony. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. It'll happen.
More broadly, there's much we can do to bring our nation together. For example, those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective. Have to do that. The language of moral condemnation and destructive routine, these are arguments and disagreements that have to stop.
No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villains, which is done often, it's done all the time. Got to stop. We should not mob people in public spaces or destroy public property. There is one way to settle our disagreements. It's called peacefully at the ballot box. That's what we want.
That's what we want. As part of a larger national effort to bridge our divides and bring people together, the media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories. Have to do it. Have to do it. They've got to stop.
Bring people together. We're just 13 days away from a very, very important election. It's an election of monumental -- just, if you look at it, monumental importance, isn't it? Wouldn't you say, monumental importance? There are dramatic differences between our two political parties. That we know. It is essential for democracy to draw a sharp contrast between the two different platforms put before the American people, and we have a chance to do that right now in many states and on November 6th. We need more, not less debate about policy issues in our country.
But what we cannot do is let our disagreements about matters of policy tear us apart as a country. Can't do that. We must accept the verdicts of elections and remember that America's greatest achievements have always been those endeavors we embarked on together. We have had great, great achievements. So true.
So let's put it all together, right? Let's put it all together. Let's get along. Great country. We're going to get along. But that's why I'm here today, that's to ask the people of Wisconsin to re-elect a truly great governor, Scott Walker... and to send an incredible woman and talent, Leah Vukmir... to the United States Senate.
Leah. [Audience chants Leah] Those are two great people. Scott and Leah are true champions for the state. Always have been. Early voting is now underway, so get out and vote. The decision and this election is so clear all over the country. Republicans are for lower taxes, less regulations, and more economic freedom.
And that's a good thing. That's a good thing. The Democrats are for higher taxes, more regulation, and more top-down government control. And by the way, do you see how nice I'm behaving tonight? This is like -- have you ever seen this? We're all behaving very well. And hopefully we can keep it that way, right?
We're going to keep it that way. Republicans want to create better health care through more choice, lower drug prices -- and you will see, very soon, drug prices will go plunging downward. You wait, you watch. It's all in motion. And we've created much more competition. Democrats want socialist health care where private plans are outlawed and abolished.
Republicans want a strong, secure border, border. [Audience chants Build the wall] You knew it a long time ago, but when our country is assaulted by thousands and thousands of people marching, and they openly say we're going to go into the country, we can't do that. We can't do that. We can't allow that.
It's unfair to you, but it's also unfair to thousands and thousands of people that have gone through a legal process. Some are waiting on line 10 years. Everything is perfect. And they don't get in, but other people just march right in. It will not happen. You watch. It won't happen. We can't let it happen.
Those who violate our laws and cross our borders illegally will be sent back home quickly. And we tell them that, because they've got a long hike. [Laughter] But they can't come. They cannot come in the way they want to come in. Doesn't work that way. We don't have borders, we don't have a country, and we have the greatest country on Earth, OK? Republicans know that the rule of law is essential to national sovereignty.
And we know that immigration enforcement is essential to public safety, national security, and the protection of American jobs, wages, and public benefits. You know that. And I said I was going to bring the jobs back. We have factories coming back. We have plants coming back. We have companies coming back.
They're all coming back. And the jobs are coming back like you have never seen before. I said it. I just didn't know I could do it this quickly. I just didn't know. Democrats oppose any effort to secure our border. And wait 'til you see what we're doing with our border over the next few weeks. As you know, we started the wall, $1.6 billion, another $1.6 billion, and we have another, but we want to build it very quickly all at one time, and we'll get it done.
But wait 'til you see what happens over the next couple of weeks. You're going to see a very secure border. You just watch. Just watch. Very secure. And the military is ready. They're all set. They're all set. [Audience chants USA] They're all ready, and there's nobody like them. Democrats believe in catch-and-release.
You know what that is, right? That's you catch a person coming across our border illegally. What's your name? My name is so-and-so. Well, do me a favor, write it down. Would you show up in about three or four years for a court case? [Laughter] Yes, I'll show up. And we never see them again! We never see them.
They strongly support sanctuary cities that refuse... to cooperate with federal law enforcement and release known gang members, predators, criminal aliens into our communities. That's not going to happen in Wisconsin, I can tell you that. Not going to happen. And we're getting them out fast. MS-13, thousands and thousands of MS-13, they're out.
We're getting them out fast because of ICE and other law enforcement. ICE, they come. And other law enforcement. And the Democrats even oppose legislation to increase the penalty for criminals and drug dealers who repeatedly break into our country and hurt and seriously injure and even worse our people. We're not allowing it anymore.
And they understand it. And they understand it. Everybody understands it. Republicans believe our judges should interpret the Constitution as written. Democrats believe judges should be able to rewrite the Constitution, which they're doing all the time. Especially when it comes to the border. They end up writing rules and regulations that are worse than anything you've ever seen.
But ultimately, we're going to get up to the Supreme Court, and hopefully that great court will straighten things out. And these are just some of the issues in this election. And these are also the reasons why it's so important for each of you, each one, to get out and vote. Get out and vote. Now, if you're going to vote Democrat, don't bother.
But if you're going to vote -- I think we have a lot of Republicans here, don't we? So between Scott and Leah, who's in favor of those two great people, right? I thought so. And you got a lot of people outside. This is a beautiful place, by the way. This is a beautiful place. Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, and America is winning, because we are finally putting America first.
Been a long time. It's been a long time. The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years. Five-oh years. Fifty. Manufacturing confidence has reached an all-time high in the history of our country. I think it's now 38 years old, this poll. It's a long time, could be longer, but I think it probably would also be -- in the history, confidence, all-time high.
More people are working now than at any point in the history of the United States. Think of that. And one of the reasons for that is that we have eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations... passed a massive tax cut for working families. And we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.
That's all for the middle class. That's on top of the tax cut we got for the middle class and for business. It's going to be great. And you see how it's working. We are taking care of our great veterans, and our military will soon be more powerful, by far, than ever before. Right? And I have to tell you, I know a lot of governors.
Some are good, some aren't so hot. [Laughter] Some are really not so good. [Laughter] And I want to just tell you, I have to say this to Wisconsin. He ran against me in the primary. He was tough. He could be nasty. [Laughter] Wow. But he was tough. And he was smart. But I've gotten to know him well, and he did something that I didn't think would be happening in this country for a long time.
I got him set up with an incredible company called Foxconn. And Terry Gou, the head, and the owner, and one of the richest men in the world, they make much of the Apple product. And you know I've been saying for a long time, it won't be complete until we get Apple -- and Apple, by the way, is spending $350 billion in this country, bringing back $230 billion from offshore, only because of our tax cuts.
And they're going to go wild. They're building a great campus. They're building places all over, $350 billion. I thought it was $350 million. That was -- sounded good. You can do a lot of good plants for three hundred -- they're doing $350 billion, Apple. But Foxconn does much of the work in China and other places for Apple.
And they came to Wisconsin with the most incredible plan. I don't know -- has anybody seen this place? It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen. And we toured it, and we had a ribbon-cutting a few months ago. And I handed it over to Scott. And I said, "Lots of luck." [Laughter] That was just the very beginning.
Ninety-nine percent of the people if they were governor could never have done that job -- not only do the job, do it so well. It was almost 15,000 jobs. And much more important, there's no plant like it anywhere in the United States. One of the most incredible things I've ever seen. One of the most incredible things.
I'll never forget, I'm going around with Scott, and Paul Ryan, and everybody. And -- and -- and, you know, just incredible. You have incredible people here. We're going around at the opening. And they needed robots, so they said, eh, rather than going and buying them from a German manufacturer, we'll make them here.
And this is complex stuff, just so you understand. These are the most sophisticated in the world. And you come back three months later, they have a whole robot factory made. It's the most incredible thing. This is truly one of the great plants -- certainly in this country, I don't think there's anything close.
And in the world, it's right at the top. And it was done because of Scott Walker. So I just want you to know. You people could have done it. A lot of jobs and all of that, but when you look at it, I've never seen anything like it. Earlier this month, I announced that we are replacing the horrible, horrible NAFTA deal with an incredible brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.
It's called the USMCA because I refused to use the name NAFTA... because I see things from NAFTA -- we still are scarred all over our country where you have empty factories, empty buildings, just by the thousands. And millions of jobs were lost. Big portions of our auto industry was lost to Mexico and other places.
NAFTA was a disaster. It was a bad deal from day one. It should have been terminated on day two. And 25 years later, I get it terminated, OK? And the new USMCA, I like that name. USMCA. It works. Now I say it like routinely. At first we had to sort of give it a little thought. Now it's very routine. USMCA.
It's a giant victory for Wisconsin farmers, manufacturers, and dairy producers. And I have to say this, because we have a lot of great farmers in this country, but I give Wisconsin a lot of credit for it. Because I came up here once, and it was rough. I was with Ron Johnson, a great person, a great senator who loves you.
And Paul. And I was with Scott. And I'm just going around, and farmers came up to me. Sir, sir, could you help me? I don't know that much about farming. But I know about business. [Laughter] And these great people came up. Sir, sir, Canada just put a surcharge on our dairy product and they did this, and they did that.
And I said, it can't be that bad. Then I'd go see another group. Sir -- and they had just put a very onerous tax on a very specific type of specialty milk. What the hell do I know about specialty milk? [Laughter] And you know what? It's funny. It was a very small part of the market, but it was the wrong thing to do. And it really angered -- because on the big part of the market, in dairy, you are paying 275 percent tariffs.
And nobody knew that. But this little tiny part of specialty market, it got you. In other words, you're paying it for years, 275. This little -- which was a fraction of the big market that you accepted and you lived with it. Basically, it was a barrier to Canada. It was a barrier. And they're great people, Canada.
But this was a barrier. This little thing got your goat. And I got up here, and I got hit by every farmer in Wisconsin over this. [Laughter] It was just a step too far, right? You know, you go up to the line. They just went a little too far. And since that time, I never forgot it. So you're really responsible, to a large extent, for the USMCA.
I never forgot. And now, as you know, the Canadian market, which was not open, is now open. Go do well. And it's a great agreement. And we're not going to lose our businesses anymore. We're not going to have them move down and build plants and build all sorts of things. And we've gotten tremendous reviews on that agreement.
So we're very proud of the USMCA and, to a very large extent, it started here because of a specialty dairy -- little, tiny, dairy product, OK? Really did, because I saw what happened. You were treated unfairly. And your political leaders -- and that's all of them -- they pushed me hard. They said don't forget those farmers.
I didn't. And I came back numerous times, and I saw the farmers. But now we have a final agreement. It's going to be approved by Congress I'm sure very quickly. I think statutorily we have to wait a period of time, and then you have to wait again, but it's right on track, doing well. And even -- I must say -- and this is very positive -- even Democrats like this deal.
The Democrats like the deal. Can you imagine? It may be bipartisan. Can you believe that? Can you believe that? And that's what we're talking about today. We can do a lot of that. And I think we will do bipartisan on infrastructure. I think we're going to have a lot of that. So that would be great. But thank you very much to the people and to the farmers of Wisconsin.
You had a lot to do with it. But two weeks ago, we achieved yet another historic victory for our nation. We proudly confirmed the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Right? Wow, was he treated unfairly. That was brutal. That was brutal. I went up to him and I said -- when I decided to -- I chose him out of the finest, brilliant legal minds, scholars in the whole country.
And for 10 years, I heard about Brett Kavanaugh. He'll be a Supreme -- young guy -- he'll be a Supreme Court judge some day. I didn't know I was going to be president. I didn't know. [Laughter] I heard he was going to be a Supreme Court judge. I didn't know I was going to be president. But for years, they talked about him because of his great intellect.
And I'll never forget. Just shows you how life is. We're in the White House. I say, Judge, because he was a judge -- now he's a justice -- but I said, Judge, I'm going to choose you for the United States Supreme Court. Now, Judge, this is going to go so fast, so easy, you're so perfect. [Laughter] You don't have a thing wrong.
You're the best student, number one in his class all over the place. You're the best -- a great intellect, a great scholar, your family, your beautiful wife, your beautiful daughters, everyone is so perfect. This is going to go so easy, so fast. [Laughter] And then I saw the way they made him suffer. But he got through it with style and got through it with grace, and now he's going to be on the United States Supreme Court for a long period of time.
And he's a good person. He's a great person. That was a tough treatment. That's what we have to get rid of, that kind of treatment. We have to get rid of it. And he sits alongside of Justice Neil Gorsuch... who we also put on the Supreme Court a little time before. And they're going to defend your rights.
They will be defending your rights, your Constitution, and your freedom, right? Not bad. A lot of people say that's the most important decision a president can make. Now, I would say war and peace, and then that, OK, if you don't mind. We'll change because that's the way it is. But it is a very, very important decision, and they are two great people.
And I'm very honored. You know, many presidents don't get a chance to put a Supreme Court justice on. Here we are, less than two years, we've put two of them on. Right? So if we go at this clip, we'll put eight of them on. How do you like that idea? Eight! One a year. We'll do one a year. We'll put one a year on. Thank you very much.
Very important that we have great, great talents and great people on the Supreme Court of the United States. This will be the election of the caravans, Kavanaugh, law and order, tax cuts, and common sense. A lot of it's common sense. A lot of politics is common sense. We are honored to be joined tonight by many great Republican leaders, including the Wisconsin leader who fought so hard for our tax cuts, regulation cuts, veterans -- hey, we fought for those veterans and choice -- we fought for choice -- and for our great military, in terms of $700 billion, we're rebuilding our military, stronger than ever before, Speaker Paul Ryan.
Paul? Where is Paul? Where is he? Where is he? And bring him up? I don't know. I think Secret Service -- looks like they're going to let you -- great job, Paul. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Great. Done a great job. Also here are your Republican members of Congress. [Audience member calls out Duffy] That's right, Duffy, we saw with Duffy.
Sean Duffy. [Audience chants Duffy] You know, I love champions, OK? I have to tell you this about Sean. So I didn't know. Sean was just a nice-looking young congressman. What do I know? Then I'm watching something and I see a guy going up a tree. [Laughter] It was a few years ago, but that's OK. He's going up a tree.
And they said, it's Sean Duffy. I said, it can't be the one I know. [Laughter] And it was. And he was the world champion for five years. And I said, that looks tough. He said going up isn't tough. It's coming down. Because a lot of times, you break your legs, you -- I can see that. They just do like a freefall.
But you have to use -- how many, every 10 feet, you have to stop, stop, stop. And if you don't stop, you're in a deep trouble. [Laughter] So Sean's been fantastic. And he's a great political talent, also. Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you. And your family. Look at her over there, huh? Do we love her? Do we like her more than Sean?
I think so. Anyway, great family. Thank you both very much. Great job. Glenn Grothman, Glenn, where is Glenn? Thank you, Glenn. What a help he's been on so many things, right? Thank you, Glenn, very much. Great job. And a man who has worked so hard, he is so smart. I actually said to him, you know, people really don't know how smart you are.
See, I worked with him on tax legislation, in particular. He knew that stuff better than anybody. He was brutal. He really understood it better than anyone. I said, you are like a hidden weapon. Senator Ron Johnson. And he took that compliment like it didn't matter. He just wanted to get back to work. [Laughter] Thank you, Ron.
Great job. We appreciate it. These people appreciate it. And I also want to thank a woman who works very hard. It's not easy being first lady, especially being first lady of Wisconsin. Tonette Walker, thank you, Tonette. Thank you. Thank you. And Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch, thank you. Thank you.
Wisconsin State Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Good job. And a man I got to know pretty well during a thing called the campaign from two years ago, Wisconsin GOP Chair Brad Courtney. Thanks, Brad. Great job. Great job, Brad. Well, you brought us to victory, so we should -- another man who brought us to victory -- and I'll tell you, he is a special person.
He's a great person. It took us all about five years to figure out how the hell to pronounce his name. But now we have it. He's doing fantastically well. He is just really somebody that -- you love him in Wisconsin, they love him in Washington, which is a rare combination, I have to tell you. But he's a very talented guy and a really good person.
Former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Thank you, Reince. Great guy. We had a lot of fun. That was a lot of fun. And he loves this place. We're especially honored to be here with the next United States senator from Wisconsin, Leah Vukmir. [Audience chants Leah] And you know I like looking at polls -- only when we're winning.
I don't like them otherwise. [Laughter] And I like real polls, too. And Leah -- Leah -- I don't know if you've seen the last polls, you're doing very well, Leah. You're doing very well. Leah is a tireless fighter for the people of Wisconsin. She will always vote for your Wisconsin values. She's a very special person.
I've gotten to know her. I don't know if she liked me at the beginning, but she likes me now. Does that make sense? [Laughter] She likes me know. We've gotten to know each other. She's an incredible woman. Leah's radical, far-left opponent is Tammy Baldwin. Who wants a socialist takeover of health care. You know, I'm trying to say that very nicely.
I'm trying to -- see, normally I'd scream it. "They want a socialist takeover of" -- now I say wants a socialist takeover... [Laughter] I'm trying to be nice, OK? Right? But it's true. Baldwin voted against our tax cuts. And she wants to restore job-killing regulations that have helped literally rebuild our country.
Baldwin opened and voted against Kate's law, if you can believe that. See voted against the thing that we're proud to have started and we're moving along rapidly, the border wall. And Tammy Baldwin voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities. Not too good in Wisconsin. Tammy Baldwin -- and this is a bad time for being in favor of open borders, but that's what she's in favor of. She wants open borders.
She wants people to pour into our country. Can't do that. Can't do that, Wisconsin. So if you want strong borders and safe communities, you need to vote for Leah. They will. They will. They will, Leah. [Audience chants Leah] I think you like her. They like you, Leah. It's going to be a big, big win. It's going to be a big win for you, because you need that kind of representation.
Thank you, Leah. Finally, let me introduce a true Wisconsin patriot, somebody that I have really gotten to know -- he's a fighter. And he's become a great friend of mine, one of the most capable people in all of government, Governor Scott Walker. You are, Scott. You are. Scott Walker is a tireless warrior.
He is a warrior. Didn't you win, like, three elections last time? Right? He's the only guy who gets elected three times and he doesn't stop. He's a warrior. That was some period of time, right, Scott? Three times! He's a warrior for Wisconsin workers and families. [Audience chants Four more years] Go ahead.
He's a good man, folks. I can tell you, he's a good man, and he loves this state. He loves the people of this state. He'll cut your taxes -- he's been doing it -- improve your schools -- he's been doing it -- bring down the cost of health care -- he's been doing that as good as anybody -- and continue creating great paying jobs for the state of Wisconsin.
Scott fights every day for you, and now we need you to fight for him. And all you have to do is go out and vote. Scott, will you come on up here, please? Come on. Come on.
Thank you. Well, thank -- thank you. And thank you, Mr. President. We are so happy to have you back here in the state Wisconsin, north-central Wisconsin. Are you happy to have the president here? Good spot. A couple weeks ago, the president called me when I was with our good friend, Mike Pence, our great vice president.
He said, where should we go? He said Wausau. Pretty good crowd here tonight. They're outside and all around. But I got to tell you, we're absolutely pumped up. We've got more people working in this state than ever before in the history of the state of Wisconsin. Eight straight months of record low unemployment.
Things are happening, just like they're happening in America. And the president -- the president mentioned my wife, Tonette, who does a super job as our first lady, but many of you know, I said before, she's got Type I diabetes. And, Mr. President, I want to thank you, you said it again today, earlier today, and I want to reinforce it to everyone here in this state and across the country.
We will always cover people like my wife with pre-existing medical conditions. Don't believe the lies. Don't believe the lies. We will cover people with pre-existing conditions. You talked about manufacturing jobs. This year, we're the second most new manufacturing jobs in the country in the great state of Wisconsin.
And, Mr. President, you talked about Foxconn. It's great to see where we were at back in June with the groundbreaking. But you know what? That helps people all across this state. It helps someone like Alex, who works at Merrill Steel, just down the way here in Schofield, Wisconsin, because he's one of the welders working on that project.
It helps the guys that work over at County Materials in Marathon City, just a few miles to the west, who are doing five-and-a-half miles of concrete for the drainage system down there. It helps people in Black River Falls at Hoffman Construction who are moving tons and tons and tons of dirt. It helps people in Eau Claire and in Green Bay and in Appleton and all over the state of Wisconsin who will benefit from the thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs at Foxconn.
And it wouldn't have happened without this president opening the door. And we took the ball and ran with it. You know, the president talked about dairy. And I remember, you talked about Reince -- a year-and-a-half ago, April of 2017, the president was talking about buy America down at Snap-on Tools in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
And when he came in, we gabbed for a minute, and we just -- as he talked about, we brought in some of the farmers, we talked about the problem, because Grassland had just cut off a bunch of our dairy farmers in this state because of Canada. The president heard about that, and he said, I'm going to bring it up right now.
The speech had nothing to do with agriculture. It was all about manufacturing. He took it head on. He said, we will take care of the dairy farmers, and unlike so many politicians in Washington in the past, this president never forgot his promise to the dairy farmers of the state of Wisconsin. He's making dairy great again in America, and it starts in Wisconsin! And I finally want to tell you -- because you want to hear him -- but one last thing, because we don't hear enough of this from the press.
You hear all sorts of myths about the tax cut. Well, let me set it straight. These aren't my numbers. These are official numbers from the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. Do you know how much the typical taxpayer saves because of this man's tax cuts, the tax cuts that the members of Congress he introduced help pass and he signed into law?
A typical family in this state, that's two people working, two-person working household, two kids at home saves $2,508. That's real money. That's not crumbs. And, Mr. President, we know a thing or two about taxes in this state, because over the last eight years, we've cut taxes on the hard-working people of this state more than $8 billion with lower property taxes and lower income taxes.
And we're going to keep doing it, because as my -- as folks heard before, my opponent wants to raise their property taxes. Tony Evers wants to raise their property taxes and income taxes and taxes on gas. More than a dollar a gallon. And what will that do? Tony's taxes will cost us jobs. We're not going to do it. We've got a plan to keep moving Wisconsin forward. And with this president, he's going to keep moving Wisconsin forward for generations to come. Thanks for the help for Wisconsin, Mr. President.
Thank you. Good job. [Audience chants Four more years] He's a great guy. Scott's opponent is an extreme liberal named Tony Evers. Tony wants to raise your income taxes substantially, wants to raise your gas taxes, raise your property taxes, raise all of your taxes. And Tony Evers wants to get illegal aliens to flood into Wisconsin to get free public benefits funded by you, the American taxpayer.
No good. No good. So don't wait. Vote early for Scott Walker. Tremendous guy. Leah -- Leah, would you come up here, please? Just quickly. Come up. She's so incredible. Come here. Come here. This is unscheduled, but I want to say it. [Audience chants Leah] Say something just for a second.
Thank you, Mr. President. It is an honor to stand with you. And I am so thrilled that you came back to Wisconsin. You promised me the day you called me after I won that primary, and you followed through on your promise, just like you have followed through on every promise you made for us. Everywhere I go in this great state -- and I looked out when I spoke to all of you before -- and it is overwhelming, because I have put on 92,000 miles on my car, and I see faces from every county that I have visited, all 72 counties, and you all welcomed me over and over and over again, and we are going to send Tammy Baldwin back to the private sector that she doesn't know exists.
Everything this president said he was going to do, he's done. And we need to send him someone in Washington, a reinforcement in that Senate, so that Senator Ron Johnson's vote isn't canceled. And I need your help to do that. Taxin' Tammy, she doesn't have your best interests in mind. Taxin' Tammy has voted to increase your taxes 413 times.
You heard the governor talk about $2,500. I think it was, $2,508, if I heard correctly. Taxin' Tammy didn't think that you deserved that $2,500. I think you do! And of course, the issue that we have been talking about, health care and health care reform, the big lie that Scott Walker talked about. Tammy Baldwin is saying that same lie over and over and over again.
We support taking care of people with pre-existing conditions. I have said it before, I'll say it again, I'll fall in front of a truck before I let people go without coverage for pre-existing conditions. Tammy Baldwin's plan, Medicare for all, you know what name is for it, Mr. President?
Go ahead.
Chaos for all. Chaos for all, because she wants to destroy, dismantle Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, TriCare. I'm not going to let her do it. I need to go to Washington to stand with this man so we fix health care reform once and for all. And one last thing, if I may indulge, Mr. President, I'm talking about chaos.
I mean, it is the left's -- that's everything they're about, chaos at the border, chaos in health care, chaos, resist, obstruct. Tammy Baldwin stands for that chaos. She stands for open borders. She stands for sanctuary cities. This -- this daughter -- this daughter of Greek immigrants who knows that we are a nation of laws and we must uphold those laws, and I want to stand with this president when he builds the wall and finishes building the wall! Thank you. I'm finished.
Thank you. Great job.
Thank you, Mr. President! We need your help. Let's win!
Thank you, Leah. Great job. [Audience chants Leah] She's terrific. And we do, we have to have her down there. She's going to be a great leader, but she -- we need the votes. And we need Leah. The Democrat health care plan would obliterate Medicare -- you know that -- and terminate Medicare Advantage for nearly half a million seniors right here in Wisconsin.
These are people that really depend on it. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it. And you know what? They've paid for it for a long time. They've paid for it. And Republicans will always protect, as Leah said, Americans with pre-existing conditions, 100 percent. One hundred percent.
And we've done a great job. We've gotten rid of a lot of different elements of Obamacare. We had it beaten, but we got no Democrat votes. Not one. And we had it repealed and replaced, but essentially we've dismantled it. We got rid of so much and so many bad elements of it. It's been brought down to size.
If you noticed, your premiums are going up because of what we've done. Going up very little by comparison. Remember, last year I came here and the year before I came here, we were talking about increases of 115 percent, 190 percent, 216 percent in some states. And we got rid of a thing called the individual mandate, where... where you had the privilege of paying a fortune in order not to pay a fortune for bad health care.
That was by far the most unpopular part. It really was the most important part, from their standpoint. Gone. It's gone. Saved tremendous numbers of people a lot of money. Saved a lot of small-business owners a lot of money. And now what we've done is we've come up with great plans. We have all sorts of co-op plans and other plans.
And people are going to them by the millions. And it's been an honor. So we've done a real job. And health care is going to be our major focus, one of our major focuses. We've done something very special. But getting rid of that mandate was so important. Scott would call me all the time, how do you get rid of the individual mandate?
Guess what? We put it into our tax cut plan. Can you believe that one? Because, you know, they talk about majorities. We don't have -- like, it's this. I always say, if a senator catches a cold, we don't have a majority, in one sense. So we have to wait. It's so close. We need more senators. We need more congressmen and women.
And it will happen, because if you look at the early voting, this blue wave doesn't seem to be doing so well. What happened to this blue wave, Paul? I've been hearing about the blue wave, right? It's not doing so well. Now, look, I'd better be a little careful, because, you know, in two weeks, if we don't do quite as well as we're maybe thinking we're going to do, I will be all over television with these exact remarks.
[Laughter] They will be doing a number, but that's OK. Look, early voting looks extraordinarily good for the Republicans. Certainly. Who knows? It doesn't matter -- it only matters on November 6th, when those votes are tallied up and counted. But the start that you've gotten out to -- because you want safety, you want security, you want great jobs, you want great Medicare and you want health care.
Thank you very much. Thank you. I like that person. [Laughter] Who is that person? Thank you. Thank you. Good-looking guy. Nice-looking man. [Laughter] But we want strength. We want a strong military. We want to take care of our veterans. We want to get our veterans -- you know, we did something for our veterans nobody thought was possible.
We got veterans' choice, where if they're not being taken care of, if they're not being taken care of, they go out to a private doctor, veterans' choice. Took 44 years, and Ryan and all of these incredible people that we just introduced, they helped every one of them. And, Paul, thank you. You worked hard on that one, right?
That was not an easy one. And then you had veterans accountability, Paul, right? That was 43 years. That means right now, if they don't treat our veterans right, they were really protected. They could do anything. They could steal, they could rob. They could be sadists. We had some of them, too. They wouldn't have been sadists with our veterans in their prime, but they were nasty.
They were nasty. You couldn't do anything. Now we can fire them so fast your head will spin. The Democrats also want to raid Medicare to fund benefits from so many different things, but they want to fund them for illegal immigrants, so the illegal immigrants come in. And how about the governor slightly different than Scott?
The governor, who's trying to become the next governor of the state of California? He wants open borders -- think of this, just think of this -- he wants open borders, everybody can come to California. And he wants to give you free health care, free education, driver's licenses. I said the other night jokingly probably a Rolls-Royce.
And one of these people said, he said he's going to give them a Rolls-Royce. And he did not say that, the governor never... [Laughter] You can't joke with these people. You can't be even a little sarcastic. I said, they want to supply a Rolls-Royce. And they actually said, one of them, just one, they want to supply a Rolls-Royce.
They said, the governor of California never said that. They can't take a joke. But maybe they will start taking a joke and maybe we're going to be a lot better off when they do. As we speak, the Democrat Party is openly encouraging caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to violate our laws and break into our country.
Don't worry about it, folks. You have nothing to worry about. Don't worry about it. The crisis on the border -- and it is a crisis, it's crazy. It's crazy. Right now is the sole result of Democrat laws and activists, Democrat judges that do whatever they want and that prevent us from returning illegal aliens back home to Central America and other parts of the world.
Democrats even support sanctuary cities that release violent gang members and MS-3 -- you see the MS-13 predators. Some people don't like it when I use that name. These are predators. [Audience members calls out] Only in Wisconsin, right. Only. She's screaming. Screaming. She's screaming. I won't say what you screamed.
[Laughter] Release them into U.S. communities, right? We don't want that. Unless you'd like to have them up in Wisconsin. Would you like to have MS-13... You sure? All right, because -- if you said yes, you know, we'll just send them your way. Paul, I don't think they want MS-13 -- doesn't work up too well, no? You want to know the truth?
I know the people of Wisconsin. Actually, I think MS-13 would be in big trouble. True. I do. Remembers believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And the Republican party will always stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement.
And you think they have an easy? They don't have an easy job. You know, ICE has taken a tremendous amount of pounding. Pounding. These are great patriots. These are people -- you're right, they're heroes. These are people -- you don't want their job. They go into nests. They call them nests of gangs and like MS-13, equal.
They go into these nests like it's a day at the office. I don't want to do it. You don't want to do it. You don't want to do it. You -- I think that one does want to do it. [Laughter] I think he does want to do it, actually. It's tough stuff. And, you know, where I grew up, near Long Island, we have, like, these great communities.
And they were infiltrated with MS-13. And we got them... [Audience members calls out get them the hell out] He says get them the hell out. We are actually. We actually are. Right? We are getting them out of this country by the thousands, if you can believe it. But, you know, it's like liberating, like a war, like there's a foreign invasion.
And they occupy your country. And then you get them out through whatever. And they call it liberation. You liberate it. ICE goes in, and they're much tougher, much stronger, and much smarter. They go in and they, in a relatively nice way -- I want to say that, relatively nice -- they get them out. They put them in the paddy wagons and they get them out of the country.
They bring them back home. Or worse. And these towns are being liberated. And the people are clapping. They're looking -- I'm telling you, it's like -- like watching World War II movies. It's like watching documentaries on World War I and World War II. The occupations, they get them, they take them out, and the people are on their windows, they're clapping and screaming and they're happy.
This is ICE. And the Democrats want to terminate ICE. They want to get rid of them. So if you want to uphold our laws, our borders, and our way of life, you need to vote for Scott Walker and Leah Vukmir. Leah Vukmir. You've got to do it. So, Leah and Scott, good luck. I think you're going to make it. If you don't make it -- he'll call up if he doesn't make it, hello, is the president there?
Oh, who's calling? Scott Walker. Didn't he lose? Yeah. Oh. [Laughter] I'll talk to him in a few months. [Laughter] But that'll never happen. Please don't let that happen. Please don't let that happen. He's got a good lead. Just -- you've got to vote. It doesn't matter about leads, you know? The lead. November 6th is your lead.
He does. He has a wonderful lead. And, Leah, lookin' good. You got to get out and vote. They'll both make it, and we need them both, badly. This election is about borders, and this election is about jobs. In less than two years, we've created 4.2 million new jobs and lifted -- listen to this -- 4.2 million Americans off of food stamps.
We've created half a million new manufacturing jobs. You remember when the previous administration said you can't have manufacturing jobs anymore. I used to say, what does he mean by that? By the way, I hate to say it, these are our best jobs. These are our best jobs. These are great jobs, and they're very important jobs for our country.
But remember they said, you need a magic wand. A magic wand. I guess we have a magic wand, right? In fact, now the number is almost 600,000, and that's since our election. And here in Wisconsin, manufacturing jobs are growing at the fastest pace in more than 23 years. African American and Hispanic American poverty has reached an all-time low.
African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest rates ever recorded. That's a tough soundbite. Isn't that a tough soundbite for the opponent? Right? And in addition to that, Kanye West likes me. Right? Which is good. Interesting guy. Big Jim Brown, right?
I had Jim Brown. These are opposites. Jim Brown sitting there. He looks like he could play tomorrow. Big Jim and Kanye, total opposites. Jim's strong and silent. Kanye, he has his ideas. [Laughter] But they're both good people, and they like what we're doing, and that's great. Great people. And women's unemployment just fell to 3.6 percent, which is, as you know -- I hate to say it, that's my worst statistic, because that's only the lowest rate in 65 years.
That's not historic. The lowest -- and I've been waiting for six weeks to get rid of that 65 years. And I haven't been able to do it, but it's happening soon. It's happening soon. We've also taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices. They want to make a deal. And I said, you're not ready yet.
It's true. They want to make a deal. And President Xi is a great person, and, hopefully, we'll do something soon or someday. But, you know, $500 billion has been taken out of this country for years every year, $500 billion. On trade, we lost $807 billion. Think of it. Eight hundred -- who made these deals?
Who made these deals? And we're the one with all the power, because we're the piggy bank that all of these countries want to come in and rob, so we have all the power. But we did Canada and Mexico, we did South Korea. We're doing a lot of them. Now they're all coming and they all want to make a deal because they're afraid of those tariffs.
They don't want those tariffs. They'll sign anything but tariffs, please. Don't -- don't do that to me, President Trump. We don't want tariffs. We don't want tariffs, please. [Audience chants Trump] Taking care of our people. We're taking care of our people. You know, we had these globalists. They didn't care so much about us. They want to take care of the globe.
I want to take care of the United States of America. And we'll help other countries. We're going to help other countries. But we can't have wealthy, wealthy countries where we take care of their military and we're not reimbursed, or we're reimbursed for a tiny fraction. Can't have that. These are wealthy countries.
I've already started. I've gone to some of them. I don't know if I should give you names. Eh, who cares? There are plenty of them. I say, Mr. Prime Minister, I say, Mr. President, I say, Mr. King, Mr. Dictator, Mr. Whoever the hell we're protecting, you got to start paying for this protection. Got to start paying.
And Prime Minister Abe, prime minister of Japan, great guy, fantastic man, actually. Just won a big election. But I said it to him. Japan's an immensely wealthy nation. They send millions and millions of cars to the United States, and they also build them in the United States. I like them better, by the way.
I think they're much nicer. But I said to Prime Minister Abe, I said, look, we're taking care of your military. We help you a lot with North Korea. They're not sending missiles over Japan. I did that. That's a pretty good -- wouldn't you say? That's pretty good, right? That's a good thing. But you're only paying for a percentage of your military.
We're doing the rest. You've got to really help us out. It's not fair. And he looked at me, and he didn't say anything. I said, has anyone ever asked you to do this before? He goes, no. [Laughter] It's true. I'm talking about billions of dollars. South Korea, the same thing. Wonderful people, President Moon.
We buy missile systems. How much is that system? Sir, that system is $1 billion. Good. General told me that. I said, General, who's paying for it? Sir, I don't know. [Laughter] I said, find out who's paying. I think I knew the answer. Comes back the next day, sir, the system is -- think of it, not a million, a billion -- the system is $1 billion, and, sir, the United States of America's paying for it. I said, why are we paying?
Let me ask you this question. You have missiles being shot from North Korea to shut -- it's not going to happen, folks, because we have a great relationship now with Kim Jong-un, Chairman Kim. Not going to happen. So this is a year ago. I said, so let me ask you, missiles go from North Korea to South Korea.
We have the best people in the world, the best trained -- we have a missile system that costs $1 billion. We shoot the missiles down. That's great. South Korea's very wealthy. They make your Samsung, your LG, they make your ships, they make everything -- they're making a fortune because of us. We have 32,000 soldiers over there that they don't pay for.
Figure that one. So they're making the missiles. I say, so, General, let me ask you a question. Why is it that they don't pay? Because, sir, they are an ally of the United States of America. And I say, General, I like them, too, but they've got to pay. They've got to pay. They've got to pay. Oh, I could tell you a hundred stories like that.
I could tell you stories all night long, but the politicians may get tired and go home. [Laughter] But we are really doing something. We secured $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military. And at my direction, very exciting, because this is where it's at, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force.
That's where it's at. Have to do it. Have to do it. Think of that. Isn't that exciting? And it's so important. That's what it is. Satellites are going to be very -- they're happening. That's where it's at. From the standpoint -- I'm not just talking about rockets going to the moon, rockets going -- I'm talking about for military protection, for military offense and defense.
That's where it's at. U.S. Space Force. And I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal or catastrophe. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And together we have made extraordinary progress, and we're just getting started.
You know, the embassy was supposed to cost $1.1 billion, you know that, right? And every president for many presidents said we're going to approve it, we're going to approve it, they never did. Because once they got to office, they found not so easy. First of all, every country in the world called, please don't do it, don't do it, don't do it. So I just turned off the phone.
I said I don't want to talk to these people. [Laughter] I was going to approve it on a Monday, and I said, tell them I'll call them back on Tuesday. I'm going to call them -- I called more people on Tuesday. I said, yeah, what's up? Well, I wanted to talk to you about the embassy. Oh, gee, sorry. It's done.
[Laughter] But I understand why Obama and Bush and Clinton and many, many all the way back didn't do it. Tremendous pressure. And we did it. But it was supposed to cost $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion. And one of the generals walked into my -- it's true, would you sign this? I started -- I signed Donald -- and I said, by the way, what is it I'm signing?
You know, I sign a lot of papers. Scary, you're signing so many papers. I said, what is this? Sir, we're building the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. Oh, how much is it? $1.1 billion, sir. How the hell do you build 1.1 -- we're building a one-story building. Any builders in here from Wisconsin? You'd do it for about $200,000, right?
Oh, it's true. I said, how do you spend $1.1 billion on a one-story structure? Sir, I don't know, but that's what they say it's going to cost. I say, wait a minute, I can't sign it. In fact, it's actually half-signed. No, it's signed half. It just says Donald. I didn't even get the J for John. Just says Donald and then you see it's a dead stop.
I said, I'm not signing it. And I called up a great man, David Friedman, one of the most successful lawyers in New York. He's the ambassador to Israel. I said, David, they want us to buy this unbelievably expensive site and they want us to build a building that's going to cost $1.1 billion. Number one, it probably will take 25 years.
It'll never happen. Let's get this thing done immediately. Is there anything -- he said, sir, can I call you back? Calls me back four days later, and he says, sir, we own the best site in Jerusalem. We don't have to buy a site. We have the best site. On the site setback, which they want for safety, setback is a building, and the building is nice, but the best location.
I think I can renovate the building, sir, and I can do it for less than $200,000. True. True story. That's a true story. I can do it for less than $200,000. First time in my life ever, I think it's the first time, I said, David, that's too little. I said, it doesn't sound right. I said, spend $400,000 or $500,000, OK? It's too little.
And we went out and we built the most beautiful building for $500,000. Yes? Go ahead. You have a doctor in the house, please? Doctor? Doctor, over here, please. Thank you. Are they OK? OK? [Audience Member calls out No] You have a doctor? Thank you, Doctor. Doctors do a great job. Take your time. That's great.
Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Hey. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Thank you folks very much. That's very nice. So we got it built. And we're happy, and we saved about $1.1 billion, essentially. And it's up. It's open. It's operating. And we're happy. Everybody's happy. If you vote Republican this November, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes.
We will protect Medicare and Social Security. We will continue to confirm judges who interpret our Constitution as written. We will secure our border. We will pass Kate's law. We'll stop those sanctuary cities, stop catch-and-release, end visa lottery, the worst. Pick it out of a hat. Pick it out of a hat.
How about that? Visa lottery. We have a lottery. A lottery for people coming to the United States. I don't think those countries are putting their finest in the lottery. We say, how do these people come here? We got them in the lottery. Oh, great. We're going to end the lottery, end chain migration, which is terrible, and we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists the hell out of our country.
We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. You now have a president who is proudly standing up for you and for America. [Audience chants Trump] Thank you. We are standing up for your values.
We are standing up for Wisconsin. And we are proudly standing up for our great national anthem. If you want to continue this incredible momentum, then you must vote Republican. Go out and vote. Vote for Leah. Vote for Scott. Great people. You won't get better. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people.
That's what's happening. This state was settled by tough frontier men and strong pioneer women who braved the wilderness to build a life and a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God.
These courageous Wisconsin patriots did not shed their blood, shed their sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win, and we are going to keep on winning like never before.
We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory, victory, victory. Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
And together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Wisconsin. Thank you.
Well, I want to thank everybody, because this was a rough, rough day for all of us. You know that? And I have to start by saying, hello, Illinois, special place, special people, great people. Hello, Illinois. And I'll tell you what, with this crowd, Mike Bost is going to win big. He has to win big. He has to win big.
But it's great to be back in the heartland with thousands of hard-working American patriots, as we work to re-elect a great man, and actually, to be honest, we have three great congressmen here with us today. And we're going to get every one of them in office. And I want to just thank you. But I do specifically -- he's been so great on steel and getting your jobs back, I felt I owed it to a congressman to come up today, Mike Bost.
Thank you. He's been fighting for you, and very hard. Before going any further, I want to address the horrible shooting that took place earlier today. The hearts of all Americans are filled with grief following the monstrous killing of Jewish Americans at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
You've all seen it. You've been watching it. It's horrible. The suspect is in custody. The federal authorities are on the scene and leading an aggressive federal investigation. State and local law enforcement has been incredible. This evil, anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us. It's an assault on humanity.
It will require all of us working together to extract the hateful poison of anti-Semitism from our world. This was an anti-Semitic attack at its worst. The scourge of anti-Semitism cannot be ignored, cannot be tolerated, and it cannot be allowed to continue. We can't allow it to continue. It must be confronted and condemned everywhere it rears its very ugly head.
We must stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat anti-Semitism and vanquish the forces of hate. That's what it is. Through the centuries, the Jews have endured terrible persecution, and you know that. We've all read it. We've studied it. They've gone through a lot. And those seeking their destruction, we will seek their destruction.
And when you have crimes like this, whether it's this one or another one on another group, we have to bring back the death penalty. They have to pay the ultimate price. They have to pay the ultimate price. They can't do this. They can't do this to our country. We must draw a line in the sand and say very strongly: Never again.
Tonight, everyone in this arena and every citizen across the land sends our prayers to the victims and their families. And we all do. We also send our gratitude to the law enforcement officers, who were incredible and who risked their lives and sustained very, very serious injuries during this horrible attack.
We salute the heroes of American law enforcement. We always do. We always do. We know how much we appreciate them, and yet they're underappreciated. They have done such an incredible job for so long, and it's a tough job. We see it now. We see it now maybe like we've never seen it before. And this is the time to renew the bonds of love and loyalty that hold us all together as Americans.
These bonds have always sustained our nation in its hour of need. You know that. Everybody here knows that. And they are always more powerful than the forces of hatred and division, anger and evil. In America, we love our families, we love our neighbors, and we protect our community. We -- we trust in God... we protect the freedom of worship... and we believe in the power of prayer.
We defend our Constitution, we defend our heritage, and we rally around our great American flag like nobody does. All of us here tonight are united by these same American values. And we are all fighting to defend these values in this election. This is a very, very important election. This could be, and I've said it, and I've heard it, and they have spoken it many times, this is our most important midterm election perhaps ever.
Because we've made so much progress. This is steel country and lots of other country. We have made so much progress, we don't want to give up that progress. We can't allow that to happen. Under Republican leadership, America is booming like never before, because we are finally putting America first. And because we put America first, I had a big decision to make.
I just spoke to the Future Farmers of America in Indianapolis. And with what happened early today, that horrible, horrible attack in Pittsburgh, I was saying maybe I should cancel both this and that. And then I said to myself, I remember Dick Grasso, a friend of mine, great guy. He headed up the New York Stock Exchange on September 11th. And the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day.
He said -- and what they had to do to open it, you wouldn't believe. We won't even talk to you about it, but he got that exchange open. We can't make these sick, demented, evil people important. And when we... And when we start changing around our lives and changing around our schedules and telling thousands and thousands -- look at this group of people and outside... And I hate to say it, but outside you have a group that's almost as big or just as big trying to get in. So you got the better location, but... But they have a better movie screen, OK? And they're great.
I see them right there, a lot of people, and great people. But we can't allow people like this to become important. And when we change all of our lives in order to accommodate them, it's not acceptable. So I thought of it for a little while, and the press said, are you going to cancel these two events? And frankly, the Future Farmers, I could have done that one.
But this is a rally for Mike Bost, and frankly this one maybe I could have, except I don't want to change our life for somebody that's sick and evil. And I don't think we ever should. I don't think we ever should. Remember the New York Stock Exchange. Remember the teams, the Yankees, George Steinbrenner.
He said we've got to play, even if nobody comes, if nobody shows up, we got to play. And I remember that George was a tough man. He was a friend of mine. But he was a good man. And he said we got to play. And they all played. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. And I love the people up here, also, and I didn't want to have any excuse.
I could have had a little bit of an excuse. There was no excuses. We have our lives, we have our schedules, and nobody's going to change it, OK? So we're here. So let's have a good time. And if you don't mind, I'm going to tone it down just a little bit. Is that OK? [Audience yells No] No? I had a -- you're from Illinois.
I had a feeling you might say that. I know you well. I had a feeling you might say that. But I do. I really appreciate it. And you are amazing people. And we wouldn't miss this. We wouldn't miss this. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great people. You're great people. You built America. You built America.
The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in more than 50 years. We produced. More Americans are working today than at any point in the history of our country. Think of that. And I don't want to be rude, but your steel industry was dead as a doornail and now it's a hot industry again. A hot industry.
They can dump if they want, but they're going to pay a big price. And that's what happened. And US Steel is bringing back many plants. You know that. And they're opening up some new ones. And Nucor, you see what they're doing. They're building brand-new beautiful plants. And I saw plans of one of them. They're so proud of them.
You didn't think you'd see that day when they're starting to build the new steel plants. And the steel workers, I said to a couple of them, big, strong guys. They came up to me. One of them said, thank you, sir, for saving our country. And he was crying. And I'm telling you, he was crying. I don't think this guy cried when he was a baby.
[Laughter] This guy never cried. But he said that. And I've had a lot of people said -- usually when I'm backstage, people will just say thank you for saving our country. And I really at the beginning... Thank you. Thank you. [Audience chants USA] Thank you. And at the beginning, when people would say that to me, I'd sort of, like, you know, I'd say it's surreal, that's a big statement.
But I realize now, when I see what's happening and what's going on and the no border theory and -- and take everybody into our country, when we can't... I realize -- I realize that if our opponent -- not my opponent, but if our opponent got in, our country would be in really serious trouble, maybe to a point where it never could come back again.
We are bringing it back. We just passed a massive tax cut for working families. And we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. We're working on it with Kevin Brady. We're putting our coal miners back to work. Clean coal. Clean coal. That was a gone industry, I'll tell you.
We're putting them back to work. Clean coal, beautiful, clean coal. What they do with coal today. And I know you won't like this much, but we're putting our steel workers back to work, right? We are really putting them back to work. We are putting our steel workers back to work. And by the way, that's an industry.
You can't do without steel. You know, we were at a point where we were just running on fumes, and we need steel for defense and aluminum, by the way, which is also roaring back. But we need steel and aluminum for defense. Some industries, you can. You can go buy it from somebody. We can't lose steel. So with those furnaces are starting up all over the place, it's a beautiful thing to see.
I'm very proud of it. Very proud of it. Thank you. Thank you, darling. Over the last two decades, nearly two-thirds of American raw steel companies went out of business. Did you know that? Two-thirds. And the rest were on fumes. More than one-third of the steel jobs -- and now it was getting up to about 62 percent -- were vanquished, they were gone.
You could say vanquished and vanished. It's a combination of both. More than 70,000 hard-working Americans saw their jobs eliminated and their way of life destroyed. They want to make steel. And I said to them, how about another industry? We'll teach you how to make a computer, little computers. Guys says -- his hands are like this.
His -- He doesn't want to make a computer. He wants to make steel. Does that make sense? I said the same thing to the miners in West Virginia. Remember that? I got -- I won that by 42 percent. Nobody's ever heard of it. Nobody ever heard of it. Over a Democrat, not like an independent over a Democrat, name, Hillary Clinton.
But... But... [Audience chants Lock her up] But I said to these beautiful guys, these -- the West Virginia, big, strong guys, their fathers were in the mines, their grandfathers, their great -- that's what they do. I said, fellas, supposing we take you to Silicon Valley... [Laughter] And we'll teach you, like, how to make these beautiful little keyboards, these beautiful computers.
They looked at me like, hey -- you know the expression. We want to dig coal. That's what they want to do. Nobody does it better in the world. And that's what they want to do. Guess what? That's what they're doing again, OK? Clean coal. Not far from here in Illinois, the historic Granite City Works had idled two blast furnaces.
You know, two of your blast furnaces were down. The whole place was down. And laid off hundreds and hundreds of American workers. But the era of economic surrender is over for our country. It's over. And earlier this year, I kept a very crucial promise. To protect our national security, I imposed a 10 percent tariff on foreign aluminum and a 25 percent tariff on foreign steel.
And now our steel, aluminum industries are roaring back to life, like nothing you've ever seen. Three months ago, Congressman Mike Bost, by my side, and I'll tell you what, he called me, sir, could you come? I said, who is this guy? He doesn't stop. He's a great guy. He called me, and I came to Illinois, and we celebrated the reopening of two blast furnaces at Granite City.
And it turned out that that was just the beginning. Thanks to our tariffs -- number one, you don't hear this -- hundreds of millions of dollars is being paid into the coffers of the United States Treasury. That's OK, too. You don't hear that. Hundreds of Illinois steelworkers and steelworkers all over the country are now back on the job, pouring 2.7 million tons of raw American steel into the spine of our country.
After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. And we are doing it with American steel and American pride. The choice for every American this November is between resistance and results. How about the Democrats? No, no. Their whole theme is resist. Oh, that's great. Resist.
It's actually the thing that they're good at. Their policies are no good. They're not good as politicians. What they do, do is they stick together and they resist and obstruct. If you don't want to be saying the words, ladies and gentlemen, Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the next two years... vote Republican. You've got to get out and vote.
And two great guys who are from a little further away, and they're doing well, but you never know in this business. We're honored to be joined tonight by Congressman Randy Hultgren and Congressman Rodney Davis. Come up, Randy and Rodney. Come up, please. These two guys are warriors, along with Mike. Mike Bost is a warrior. Get them in. Come on up, fellas.
Thank you, Mr. President. God bless you all. This is amazing. We need your vote. My name is Randy Hultgren. I represent the northern suburbs. We've got a tough battle running against a very liberal who absolutely is dying to support Nancy Pelosi for speaker. We've got to stop that. We've got to hold the House.
We've got to continue to fight for this great country. God bless you all. Get out and vote. Vote early. Thank you.
Hey, everyone. When I was up here earlier talking about the success of Republican leadership in Washington, working with President Trump, what was that chant we made? [Audience chants Promises Made, Promises Kept]
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I have to tell them -- be careful of that runway. You know, that runway is so narrow. Can you imagine if I went down on the runway, oh, would there be a -- oh. Oh. No, no, could you imagine? It would be -- you're right. Well, maybe they'd give me a pass and they'd say let's not show them, no? I'm always very careful.
You know, it's funny. I walk down the planes is very -- nobody cares if you walk nice and easy, so -- because if I ever tripped or stumbled just a little bit, it'll be headline news. [Laughter] And whoever's doing these runways, whoever the hell it is. Please make them a little bit wider, because that sucker is narrow.
That is a narrow runway. Finally, it's my pleasure to introduce the person we are all here tonight to support, Congressman Mike Bost. Mike fights every day for the hardworking people of Illinois, and I know it probably better than anyone. He calls me. Please, you've got to help my people. Other people, honestly, other people don't care.
This guy cares. That's why I'm here. That's why I'm here. He voted to cut your taxes, reduce your regulations, protect your Medicare, protect your pre-existing conditions. Mike Bost defends Illinois farmers, Illinois miners, and Illinois steel workers. Mike, come on up.
Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you. Thank you for coming out and showing how much we love our president, Donald Trump. Thank you. And the most important -- the most important thing to remember, the other two gentlemen that were up here, if you're in their district, get out and vote. If you're in our district, get out and vote.
Why? Because if you want our president to continue to succeed, you cannot allow Nancy Pelosi to take that House back. It's up to you, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you for leading in a way that we need America to be led, and thank you for coming to Southern Illinois. [Audience chants USA]
Good job. Thank you, Mike. And a vote for Mike is really a continuation to make America great again. Very simple. Very simple. Now, I did a little tiny bit of research. And Mike's opponent, Brendan Kelly, is a vote for Nancy Pelosi and, of course, Maxine Waters... and their job-killing agenda. Brendan Kelly opposes your tax cuts.
He's weak on crime. He's for open borders. Can you believe some -- seriously. Forget about -- forget about Brendan Kelly. Let's say you're a politician and you're running on this platform, open borders, we're going to take care of illegal aliens' health care. OK? Think of it. We're going to raise your taxes.
Think of it. How do you -- how do you win a race like that? Seriously. How does anybody win a race like that? I don't know. Brendan Kelly is beholden to the far-left Democrats funding his campaign. His third-largest contributor is a group of ultra-liberal -- you know who they are, whose name tells you everything you need to know.
It's called Swing Left. You like -- do you like -- so I think these people don't want to swing left. If you want to stand up for American jobs, factories, and workers, you must vote for Mike Bost. The Republican agenda is America's agenda. Republicans want to lower your taxes, they want less regulation, they want fair trade deals.
Oh, am I making you good, fair trade deals. I'm not making you fair trade deals. I'm making you unfair trade deals in our favor, OK? It's about time. You have been ripped off by a lot of countries. And I don't blame the countries. I don't blame them. I blame us. I blame our leadership. They should have never allowed NAFTA.
You look at NAFTA. You look at that. You look at what the European Union has done to us. You look at what China has done to us for so many years. So we're in a little dispute with China. We put $250 billion worth of tariffs on China at 25 percent. And I think we're going to make a deal. You know, look, if we do good and if we don't, that's OK, but we have a tremendous -- and we can put another $257 billion -- billion dollars' worth of tariffs on China.
And I have a feeling that everything's going to work out. They want to make a deal. I said, you're not ready yet. You're not ready yet. Remember they said, please make a deal with Canada. Please, these politicians stand up, not Mike, not Mike. Not the other two, either. The other two are saying don't do -- do whatever you want, because they want a great deal.
You know, you can't just run and make it. Canada has had an unbelievable deal. Canada, we love Canada, we love Canada. And I actually like the prime minister. I do. But -- but I have to -- good guy. No. But for years and years, they've taken advantage. They had on dairy products a tariff of 275 percent. Nobody knew that until I came along and explained it. This woman goes, what?
[Laughter] You're about four months late, but that's OK. [Laughter] And it's always tough. You know, you're negotiating -- and I'm telling Mexico and Canada, hey, I don't care if we ever make a deal, and then I'll have congressmen and senators standing up saying he must make a deal with Canada, he must make a deal with Mexico.
And I'm telling them, I couldn't care less if I make a deal. It doesn't really work. It doesn't work. But it did work. And you know what? We made a great deal, and I think they -- hopefully they made a great deal for Canada, they made a great deal for Mexico, and we all live happily ever after, but we have now got the USMCA.
It's a great deal. And we opened the borders and our companies will not be flowing into other countries, because now, if they do, they pay a tremendous penalty. Republicans want strong borders, no crime, and no caravans, right? We don't want caravans. We're not having caravans. [Audience chants Build the wall] So we started the wall.
We spent $1.6 billion. We then spent another $1.6 billion. Now we're spending another $1.6 billion. But I want to do it all at one time, but you know what? Watch, just watch. They're going to go crazy when I say this. You're going to be so happy next week. You're going to see something happen next week. You're going to be very happy.
You're going to be very happy. And you know, the military is going to the border. You do know that. And I want the people of the caravan to come into our country, but they have to come in legally, like all of the millions of people that are waiting on line right now. They can't break into our borders. They're not going to. We've done an incredible job, ICE, Border Patrol, we've done -- you know, I always say, it's my fault.
You know why it's my fault? Because the country is doing so well, it's so successful that everybody wants to come here. But it doesn't work that way. So it's my fault. I take the blame. I take the blame. If we let the country fail, we'd have no problem. But we don't want to do that. We don't want to do that.
So you're going to see -- we called in the military. The military, oh, they're ready, they're ready. And I wish I could just tell them -- and I say it, caravan, turn around. You're not coming in. You're not coming in. I'm sorry. We have taken thousands of MS-13 out of this country, ICE. We've gotten them out.
And if you look at that large group, sometimes it gets up to 17,000 people, they say. Today they said it's really gets bigger and bigger. And doesn't make any difference, because they're not coming in. They're not coming in. The military is all ready. And we're going to have border protection. You watch.
We're going to have a very strong border protection. But they're not coming in. They can't come in. We want them very badly. We actually need people for our companies, because we have many, many companies coming in to the United States. They're coming in, car companies, they're going into Michigan and Ohio and all over.
They're coming into Illinois, get your taxes down a little bit. We got to get your taxes down. Right? But they're coming in to Illinois. But we have car companies, they're going North, South Carolina. They're coming into Florida. Prime Minister Abe was showing me. We have a list of companies, they're all -- and you know why?
Because Japan has made so much money for so many years. I say we have to even it up now, folks. We have to even it up now. The European Union, last year, they made $151 billion. They won't take our product, but we take their Mercedes-Benzes and their BMWs. Not going to happen anymore, unless we straighten it out.
They understand that. And with China, that's the big one. That's the big one. China has been averaging $500 billion for many years. And I told President Xi, who I like a lot, he's the president of China, strong, smart, I said, I don't blame you. I was giving a speech in China, and I was ranting and raving about how China has been ripping off the country.
And then I realized I was in China. This wasn't playing too well. [Laughter] I said, this speech is not -- this speech is not playing well. And I looked at President Xi. He was looking up, what the hell is this all about? [Laughter] And I looked at him, I said, but I don't blame you. And he felt better. But he wanted to know why.
I said, I don't blame you, because our leaders were missing in action. They should have never let it happen. Just like they should have never let the whole situation in North Korea happen, get to that point. But we're doing great there now. No more rockets, right? I say all the time, no more rockets, no more missiles, no more nuclear testing.
We got our hostages back. We're getting our remains, the remains of our great heroes, they're coming back. And we have a good relationship with Kim Jong-un. We have a great relationship with Chairman Kim. And we feel good about it. So there's not much they can say. Look, there's no more testing. They're closing sites.
There's no more nuclear. There's no more -- the nuclear testing stopped. There's no missiles going over Japan. Think of it. We got our hostages back. We got our hostages back. We didn't -- hey, people said we'll never get the remains back. Vice President Mike Pence got the remains. He greeted the remains of these great, great heroes.
All right? In Hawaii, we're getting the remains back. So the only thing they said is now, when did I leave there, three months ago, would you say, Singapore? Would you say it's three months? No much more. So let's say I left three or four months ago. The only thing they say is, it's not moving fast enough.
They've been working on this for 70 years. I've been doing it for four months. And the rhetoric was very tough. Remember? Very, very tough. They actually said this is horrible, the way he's talking, horrible. This is going to cause war. Well, you would have been in a war the other way. This is going to cause war.
Horrible, oh, did they go after me. So now all they can say is two things. They can say we met. Remember? Because we've got everything. We're working along. We're getting along great. It's going to be great for North Korea. North Korea will become a great economic place, that location so good, between China, Russia, and South Korea.
What a location. It's going to be fantastic. But you know what? So they said, how can we go after President Trump? Ah, he met. I met. In other words, I met. Think of that. What did I give? I met. So that was one thing. The other thing they say is, it's not going fast enough. What, three and a half months?
And nothing's happened. It's so good. And remember when I first came in or just before I came in, right, just before, everyone really thought we were going to war and that was going to be a potential nuclear catastrophe. Well, I can't -- no, I mean, look, who knows in life, right? I'm not going to say -- I can only say the relationship is really good and we're really in good shape and they're in really good shape and they're happy and we're happy.
And if it takes long, I don't care. I tell my people, I couldn't care how long. As long as there's no testing, as long as there's no nuclear testing, moving mountains over a little bit, that's the kind of testing. But it's working well. But you remember when they said it's too rough, the rhetoric. You remember the -- I don't even want to say it now, because I have such a good relationship.
I won't even say it. I won't even say it. But the rhetoric was brutal. But ultimately, it was all very important to get this to a point where now we really have a relationship. Now -- and again, who knows? But I think it's working out really well. And before I got there, you were in trouble. This was going to be a big war, millions of people killed.
Seoul is 30 miles away from that border. And you talk about a protected border. That's a serious border. That's a wall like you never saw before. You look at the wall and you say, uh, I'll pass, I'm going back home. [Laughter] That is a -- that is a -- I looked at it. I saw it. That's a real deal. It's a fence with a lot of electric current going through it. A lot of different things happening on that fence.
You know what you say, you take a look at that, you say, I'm passing. But you know, it's funny. So with that one, they said, he's too tough, it's too strong. The rhetoric is -- we're going to end up in war. I had a great meeting with Vladimir Putin. Great meeting. We got -- I talked about everything. We will do great.
And don't forget, Russia wants our help economically. We're an economic -- we have created such wealth. I have done a really good job, $11.7 trillion. Russia wants us to be involved. Russia wants us. Everybody wants our help. I brought up the pipeline. I said, why is Germany paying billions of dollars a month for energy in a pipeline that goes to Russia?
Why is Germany giving billions of dollars to Russia and then we're supposed to protect Germany and Europe from Russia? So they're paying the person and the country. Think of it. They're giving billions of dollars for the pipeline. Nobody else brought that up. Nobody else. I brought it up. But they said, he was too nice to Putin.
So with one, I was too rough, the other one I'm too nice. And let me tell you, if I walked up to President Putin and started a boxing match, and I would have done just fine. But if I walked up to President Putin and started a boxing match, they would have said, he was too tough, this is terrible. In other words, makes no difference, makes no difference.
But we had a very successful meeting With Russia and President Putin, and we're just doing great in foreign affairs. We are doing so much better than anybody thought possible. So much better than we've done in years. And we'll end up getting along well with Russia, well with North Korea well with China after we equalize out.
But we're getting along with a lot of people. And part of the reason we're doing that, and very important for us, is we have built and are in the process of building by far the strongest military that we've ever had. We have to have it. We have to have it. But even that, it's economics, because people want a part of this dream.
You know, every country virtually that comes in to see me, the prime minister, the king, the queen, the president, every country, they start off by saying, Mr. President, congratulations on what you've done. We've never seen numbers like this coming out of the United States. We've never seen anything like it. We've never seen... And if we can help other countries -- and that includes the big ones and the strong ones, I want to help them.
We want to get along with everybody. We want to get along with everybody. But we want to have a level playing field, not what we had before. OK? Earlier this month, we achieved a historic victory for our Constitution and for the rule of law. We proudly confirmed the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Right? Boy, oh, did they treat him horribly. Did they treat him badly. A great scholar, a great intellect, a great person, great family. Did they treat him badly or what? That was hard to believe. This will be the election of the caravans, the Kavanaughs, law and order, tax cuts, and you know what else? It's going to be the election of common sense, because most of it's common sense.
A lot of it's common sense. People say he's a great, great conservative. You know, if somebody else did what I did, two great Supreme Court justices already, Justice Neil Gorsuch, don't forget, one of the greats. He will be -- he's doing fantastically. Another great intellect, great scholar, Harvard, Oxford.
These are a serious, great people. Justice Kavanaugh, Yale, then Yale Law, top, top talent. I heard with Justice Kavanaugh for years, long before I thought of doing this, 10 years ago, I heard someday there's a man named Brett Kavanaugh, he'll be on the Supreme Court. I said, who is that? But I really didn't care, because I didn't figure I'd be putting him on the Supreme Court, right?
I hadn't given it too much thought at that time. That was a long time ago, 10 years ago. But we are doing great. But if somebody named Bill Smith was president and he did the things I did, tax cuts, regulation cuts, two Supreme Court justices, right to try, you look at all of the things we've done for the vets, you look at the rebuilding of our military, $700 billion.
And his name was Bill Smith, President Bill, they would say he is the greatest conservative of all time. But because his name is Donald Trump, you have the haters and they continue to hate -- these are foolish and very stupid people. Very stupid people. No, I see some of these guys -- seriously, and, look, for the most part, I think -- I just came out -- was it 93 percent?
I'd ask the Hollywood -- look, this is like the Academy Awards. Look how many cameras they have back there. It's the Academy Awards. We are in the Academy Awards. But 93 percent of the people in the Republican Party, it's like a record or something like that, 93 percent have a high approval rating of Trump.
OK? But I'm not -- I'm not talking. I'm talking about that tiny, little -- you know, the losers that were -- the losers that were some guy named Kristol, Bill Kristol. He -- listen. He called it wrong from day one. He said he's not going to run. OK, I ran. He is not going to win the primaries. OK, I won the primaries.
He will not win the election. I won the election. He will never get a Supreme Court justice approved. I got that. He will never get tax cuts. I got that. He will never cut regulations. I cut more regulations than anybody in the history of the country. I mean, these are losers. Why do they put them on television?
Seriously? Why are they on -- every time I watch -- and I want to say, gee, I wish you could almost like debate these people. They're like fools. And just say every single thing that they've wanted in their whole life that they never would have gotten, I've got them. And they still hate Donald Trump. It's incredible.
Fake. No, but there's fake -- and honestly there's fake on our side, also, although I don't even know if they are. But I could name the names. I just don't want to get into it. But you know what I'm talking about. So we have the greatest conservative agenda ever, but I don't view it that way. Somebody started, are you a great conservative?
I say honestly -- and I think you'll understand this, because you people, you built this country, OK? You built this country. You can understand this. You can understand this. And I just said it. I am somebody that has tremendous common sense. So whether it's conservative or not conservative, it's the right thing, but it's common sense.
OK? It's common sense. And when I see open borders and come on in, I mean, in California, he wants open borders, the man running for governor, the Democrat, and I think your Republicans are doing a good job out there. But it's a hard place, because the Democrats, who knows. But in California, he wants open borders.
He wants to take care of all welfare, all medical everything. He wants to pay for college education and education. He wants to pay for medical. I mean, California is going to have more people than the United States of America. No, seriously. People are going to come from all over the world. They get free education, free health care.
I mean, does anybody really believe -- and by the way, they owe about 14 zillion dollars. And they just put a gas tax on that the Republican candidate wants to take off. He should win, John Cox. He should win. He's so good. It's a hard place to win, but he should win. He wants to take off the gas tax. They have a gas tax.
But it's really -- I think I am the person and I am running -- I'm conservative, but I'm running on common sense. It's all common sense. We can't let people break in and assault our country. We can't let -- you saw the caravan. I mean, you look at it. Sometimes it is massive. How the hell can we take everyone in? And some of those people are people that we don't want.
I hate to say it. Some of those people are people that we do not want. And some of those people I would love to have, because we need them, but they have to apply. As we speak, the Democrat -- not the Democratic -- the Democrat -- I hate saying it. You know, it so -- that doesn't flow right. I say the Democrat Party, and I always say it, because it's the right thing.
Their name is the "Democrat Party." It sounds so much more beautiful, the "Democratic Party," right? And I say to myself, I don't want to tell them they should probably change their name. But as much as I hate saying it, because it sounds badly, and it doesn't roll off your lips, the Democrat Party is openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and overwhelm our country.
And Democrat sanctuary cities released these criminal aliens out of jail and right onto your streets. And you have it up here more than you know. You do know that. Illinois. Congratulations. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And the Republican Party will always stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement and those great Pittsburgh police officers.
You saw the job they did. We stand with them, and we wish them well. God bless them. Seriously injured. This election is about borders, and this election is about jobs. In less than two years' time, we have created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Think of that.
Because they're working. Do you know how much money our country saves when we do that? And you have happy people. We have created almost half-a-million new manufacturing jobs. Think of that. Remember? You'd need a magic wand. Nobody's manufacturing anymore. I kept saying, when I heard the past administration -- I'm being nice.
I want to be nice! When I heard the past administration say that we don't have to make things anymore, I say explain that to the people of Illinois, please, OK? And actually the number is going to be 600,000 new manufacture. And these are our best jobs. African American poverty has reached an all-time, historic low, lowest it's ever been.
That's why Kanye West and Big Jim Brown, and so many others, so many others. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have reached their lowest rates in the history of our country. How do you win that one? If I'm in a debate, and you know the Democrats have always laid claim, because it was sort of like an automatic vote, it's not automatic anymore.
Take a look at the polls. Smart, they're smart people, and take a look at the polls. Not automatic anymore. And how do you win that statement? How do you win the statement that we have now? Let's say I'm in a debate with one of these Democrats, whoever is chosen. So far. I, like the field very much. [Laughter] Somebody said, who do you like best?
I said I like them all. So far. But how do you lose a debate where you say as an example -- no, we can't use Pocahontas anymore. She's got no Indian blood. We can't use the name. He says call her Pocahontas. I can't do it. She doesn't have any Indian blood. I have more than she does, and I have none. Right?
I have none, but it's more than her. So I can't call her Pocahontas anymore, but I think I will anyway. Do you mind? I think I will anyway. But how do you lose a debate -- you're up in a debate, millions of people are watching, and they're going to say what they're doing for the African Americans and what they're doing for the Asians, what they're doing for the Hispanic Americans.
And I say, excuse me, but we just had the best job numbers in the history of our country for all of those groups. How do you win that? You know what happens? They go, uh, OK, let's get on to the next subject. But that's not all. Almost every category, every number is the best. Except I failed with women.
You know that. Women's unemployment just fell to 3.6 percent, which is only the lowest rate in 65 years. So that's not historic. We're going to get there soon. Remember last election? They said he will do badly with -- look at all the women signs, right? He will do badly. I love you, too. He will do badly with women.
He will not get the women. Did you see the women vote? I think I won the election because of the women, not the men. No, we did very well with the men, too. We did well with the men, too. The men get it. They get it. We're bringing down the price of prescription drugs massively. This week, I took historic action to stop the global free -- you know what this is. We actually capitalize it. Global freeloading in which drug companies charge higher prices for Americans to subsidize lower prices for countries throughout the rest of the world.
Other than that, it's very fair to us. We're not doing that anymore. Secretary Azar has done an incredible job. Drug prices will be falling radically. Got a lot of people that are middlemen that aren't going to like me too much. Republicans are also strongly protecting Medicare. A majority of Democrats on the ballot for Congress have already signed up for a government takeover of health care that would obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage for half a million Illinois seniors who depend on it. It will obliterate it. Republicans will defend Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it. And whether you know it or not, they've actually paid for it. This week, I proudly -- very proudly signed into law the largest bill to fight the opioid epidemic, largest in American history, $6 billion to fight a big problem that you have in Illinois and that we have all over the country.
We passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor, rather than waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks. Forty four years they've been trying to pass that. I got it passed, it's signed as of two months ago. It's finished. Here's a veteran. Are you happy? Are you happy?
Thank you. He's happy. Thank you, man. Thank you. Thank you. He just said you saved our country. I love you, veteran. Thank you, man. Hold up that American flag. Hold it up. Great. Thank you. Thank you. I like him. I like him. At first, I thought he was a protester. We don't seem to have too many protesters anymore.
You notice, a lot of love in these rooms. We don't have too many -- I shouldn't say that, they'll start sending paid protesters that are... [Laughter] And the landmark V.A. accountability law, don't forget that, to ensure anyone who mistreats our great veterans -- and by the way, in primetime they would have never mistreated our veterans.
But they were bad. We have a sadist. We have some bad people. They're gone, boom, we fire them. You weren't able to get that for 45 years. We got it signed. We got that signed, too, veterans' choice and accountability. They're accountable if they steal, if they rob, if they hurt our veterans, if they're not there, if they punch in but they're not there, we can fire them.
And you think that was easy to get through unions and civil service? It wasn't. But we got it passed, and I signed it, and they let go of a lot of people that were not treating our veterans properly. We secured $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military, and at my direction the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force.
Space Force. Very important, very important. And I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It was a catastrophe. And Iran is not the same country anymore. I hate to say it. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And altogether, because I don't know whether you know it or not, but I know it, and a lot of you do know it, this is the greatest political movement in the history of our country.
This is the greatest in the history of our country. We have a lot of bad people out there trying to hurt us, but we're not going to let that happen. We've made extraordinary progress, and we're just getting started. Keep winning, he said. You're right. We're going to keep winning. We're going to win so much you people are going to get so disgusted and tired.
You're going to be so tired of winning. You're going to go to Mike Bost, and you're going to say, please, Mike, get them -- with the president, we can stand all this winning. The truth is, we are winning. We're starting to win a lot, you have to say. Mike, talk to him. Talk to him. Talk to our president.
We're not used to this. We've been losing for so many years here in Illinois, and now we're winning. Our steel is coming back. Our taxes are going down. Our regulations are going out. We got health care that's good. We got rid of the individual mandate disaster from Obamacare. Mike, we don't want to win so much.
We're getting tired of winning. it's getting boring. And I'll say, I don't care, Mike, I'm not going to obey that one. We're going to keep -- you go back and tell the people of Illinois and the rest of this country we're going to keep on winning. I don't care. I don't care if they like it or not, we're going to keep on winning.
I don't care. But I know the people of this country, and the people of this country, they want to keep on winning. That I can tell you. If you vote Republican this November, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes like we've been doing. Think of where you are now compared to where you were three or four or five years ago.
It's like a different planet. We will protect your right to free speech and religious liberty. And we will continue to appoint judges who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We will fully secure our border. We will pass Kate's law. We will stop sanctuary cities, stop catch and release, end the visa lottery disaster.
We will end chain migration, and we will keep the criminal drug dealers and terrorists the hell out of our country. We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's going to happen. And they're going to love it. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America.
Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values, we are standing up for our great steelworkers, we are standing up for the great state of Illinois, and we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. To continue our incredible momentum, you need to get your friends, get your family, get your co-workers, and get out and vote early for Mike Bost.
Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country, returning power to you, the American people. That's who we're doing, and that's what we're doing. Illinois is the state that gave us two of our greatest Republican presidents. Not bad, by the way. Not bad. I mean, you got to pick two.
These aren't the worst. I can think of a little bit lower down the ladder. You gave us Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Not bad. Wow. That's not a bad job. They'd be high on my list. And Illinois is the state that gave us generations of proud farmers and steelworkers and miners and soldiers and patriots who made our country into the most powerful nation on Earth.
And we are now more powerful. We have a greater military right now and getting better all the time. Our military is bigger and better and stronger. We have never had anything like it. And you know what? The stronger it gets, the less likely it is that we'll ever have to use it, because that's the way the world works.
And everything is made in the USA. Everything. The greatest ships and missiles and rockets, the greatest jet fighters and bombers and tankers, the greatest submarines in the world, it's all made right here in the USA. This state was settled by tough pioneer women. Really, they were tough. Much tougher than the men, by the way, but we won't -- tough women.
Strong women. Beautiful women, I'm not allowed to say that. They're strong, they're tough, and they're beautiful. And the men weren't so bad, either. The men went along for the ride. The men weren't bad, either, OK? Is that enough for you, men? No, they're not too happy about it. From the foundries to the farm fields of southern Illinois, your ancestors worked, they sacrificed, they built a life and a home with their own two hands.
They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud American heritage.
For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our great children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win, and we are going to keep winning. It will be total victory. You know it and so do I. We will not bend, we will not break, we will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, we will never surrender, and we will always fight on to victory, always.
We are one people and one family with one glorious American destiny. We all share the same home. We all share the same heart. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same almighty God.
And all together, with love in our hearts and hope in our souls, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Illinois. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Do we love Nashville, do we love Tennessee. We love Tennessee. Thank you. What a crowd. What a crowd. I want to thank you. I want to thank Trace Adkins; he was incredible. And, you know, Trace won The Apprentice. Trace is a winner.
And I want to thank you very much. Trace. That was fantastic. I'm thrilled to be here in the great State of Tennessee, and that's what it is; it is a great state. It's the heart of American music, and I mean incredible music. I love country music and culture, joined by thousands of hardworking American patriots.
So joining us this evening are many of your wonderful Tennessee Republican leaders. Boy, this feels just like before our election. This is a big crowd of people, a lot of people, a lot of people, with bad weather and bad everything. And they're still coming in. We love you. We love you. Thank you.
And we're producing for you. We're really producing. You know, people are saying that we made certain promises and I'm the only politician -- can you imagine, the word politician -- I never thought that was going to happen, I don't even like it -- but I'm the only politician that produced more than I said I was going to produce, and we're only 1 1/2 years in.
But, before we begin, we have some great people. State Republican Party chairman who's done an incredible job, Scott Golden. Scott? And Lieutenant Governor Randy McNally. Randy, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Randy. Thank you, Scott.
From your House delegation we have David Kustoff. Where's David? David? Thank you, David. David Kustoff. Scott DesJarlais, the most beautiful name in politics. Thank you. Diane Black? Diane? Where's Diane? She's in a big race. Good luck, Diane.
And Jimmy Duncan, right, Jimmy. First time I met Jimmy Duncan, I was in Pennsylvania doing a speech with a good friend of his, Lou Barletta, who's now running for the Senate in the great State of Pennsylvania and I think he's going to do really well. He's an incredible guy.
But they're good friends. So I was making a speech and Jimmy Duncan comes in. I didn't know Jimmy at the time. This is before the election. And Tennessee has early voting, right, very early. And this is like three weeks before the election.
And he comes up and he goes, You know, Mr. Trump -- see, then, it wasn't Mr. President; it was just Mr. Trump -- and he goes, You know, I've never seen anything like it, but I love the State of Tennessee. And those people were coming from the hills, from the valleys, from the mountains, they were coming from everywhere. He said, I've never seen anything like it.
Really early voting in Tennessee. He said, All I can say is you're going to win Tennessee in a landslide, which we did. But he said, If the rest of the country is like Tennessee, right, Jimmy, If it's like Tennessee, you're going to win this election very easily. But we all kept hearing, he can't get to 270. Remember, you need 270 Electoral College. There is no way to 270. And they were right: 306.
There is no way to 270. I went to Maine. I love Maine, but I went there four times, because I needed one, I had to find one because I believed the fake news. They were wrong. There they are right back there.
They're fake. They are fake. Look how many of them. Look how many, oh, boy. That's a lot of people back there. That's a lot of people. Fake news. We're also very grateful to be joined by Senator Lamar Alexander. Lamar?
And Senator Bob Corker. And, finally, the person we are all here tonight to support, the next United States senator from the great State of Tennessee, a very, very early supporter of ours and a really wonderful woman -- she loves your state, she loves your country, she's going to win -- Marsha Blackburn. Come up, Marsha, for a second. Marsha?
Thank you so much, Mr. President. We are absolutely thrilled that you are here and I'm glad all of you are here. Thank you for everything you've done to elect so many Republicans and thank you for everything that you are doing for President Donald Trump.
I've got to tell you, he has had an amazing 18 months -- a Supreme Court justice, 40 federal judges, repealing record number of regulations, tax cuts, decreasing illegal immigration, standing up to China and North Korea, defeating ISIS in Syria. Let me tell you, that is what you call getting the job done.
And I'm going to tell you right now, Tennessee needs a senator who is going to support President Donald Trump, and I am going to be there to stand with President Donald Trump and take your Tennessee values to Washington D.C. to fight with him to get the job done. Thank you all so much.
Thank you, Marsha. She is a great woman. She is a great woman. So we need Marsha in the Senate to continue the amazing progress and work that we've done over the last year and a half. There has never been an administration -- and even some of our enemies are begrudgingly admitting this -- that has done what we've done in the first year and a half. Think of it.
We've created 3.3 million new jobs since Election Day. Now, if we would have said that before the election, that I'm going to create 3.3 million new jobs, we would never have survived the onslaught from the fake news. They would have not accepted it. They wouldn't have accepted it.
They would have said, There's no way you can do that. Unemployment is at its lowest level since the turn of the century. Now, the actual number is 19 years, but I said, Let's see, 19 years -- that brings us into the last century. I love the sound of the turn of the century, right? So I said, Let's not use 19; let's say the turn of the century. But that's a long time.
African-American unemployment and Hispanic-American unemployment are at their lowest levels in history -- in history. Unemployment among women is at its lowest level in almost 20 years.
And wages, for the first time in many, many years, are finally going up. Wages are going up. I used to talk about it on the campaign trail. People were making less money working two and three jobs than they were making 20 years ago.
Well, now, wage -- it's going up, folks. What can I say? They're just going up. Wages going up and they're going up fast. The forgotten men and women of our country are no longer forgotten. They are forgotten no more, no more.
We're reasserting American strength and confidence and talent. We have tremendous talent in this country, tremendous talent in this room, a big room, this stadium, this arena. We have tremendous talent, and our talent and our strength is being respected again.
Prosperity is booming. Optimism is surging and America is winning. We're winning. We truly are making America great again. Look at all those hats. But, most importantly, our country is respected again all over the world. We're not making apologies. We're not making excuses. We're respected again as a country.
No more apologies. But, to keep this momentum going, to continue this incredible progress, to keep on winning, you have to vote Republican in November. You see what's happening with the Democrats.
So Marsha's very liberal Democrat opponent, Phil Bredesen -- I've never heard of this guy. Who is he? Who is he? He's an absolute, total tool of Chuck Schumer. He's a tool of Chuck Schumer and, of course, the MS-13 lover, Nancy Pelosi.
She loves MS-13. Can you imagine? Remember? I said they're animals, and she said, How dare you say that? How dare you say that? Have you seen what they've done? Have you seen what they are doing to us? And we're taking them out of our country by the thousands -- out, out by the thousands.
So Philbert was recruited by Schumer to run for the Senate. He had to get Pelosi's approval -- can you believe this? And, if Bredesen were ever to get elected, he'd do whatever Chuck and Nancy -- remember the term, Chuck-and-Nancy. They don't want the wall. They want open borders. They're more interested in taking care of criminals than they are in taking care of you.
Bredesen donated a lot of money to the campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton -- Crooked Hillary. So how do you like the fact they had people infiltrating our campaign? Can you imagine? Can you imagine? Can you imagine people infiltrating our campaign? Is there anybody in this big, beautiful arena right now that's infiltrating our campaign? Would you please raise your hand? That would take courage.
Now, look, you take a look at what's going on. Never in the history of our country has something taken place like took place during this election. In all fairness, I'm no fan of Crazy Bernie Sanders. I'm no fan. But I want to tell you, he got screwed. He did. He did.
Crazy Bernie -- he still doesn't know what happened. No, he doesn't know. I saw him on television. I don't know what happened. Me, too. I thought he was winning.
But it helped me, because we were very, very cautious and we worked hard -- many, many speeches a day. That last month of campaigning -- and some of the polls got it right. But I'll tell you what, I'd see the crowds, crowds like this. I'd go one to another to another all over the country.
She'd go there. The only way she filled up the arena was to get Jay-Z. And his language was so filthy that it made me, like, the most clean-cut human being on earth.
He'd stand up there before those crowds -- and, by the way, without any musical instruments, I had much bigger crowds than he was drawing -- but he'd stand up before those crowds and he'd use the F-word and Hillary would sit back and -- I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. Please, don't have him use that kind of language anymore.
And then he'd finish and everybody would leave and she'd be standing up making a speech to 400 people. But Phil Bredesen supported her. And he supported her ideas. He opposes the border wall. We need a wall. We're going to get the wall. We've already started doing it.
So we've already started. We got $1.6 billion in the last approval. Now, remember this: We had to take care of our military folks, OK? We had to take care.
I got $700 billion for our military and next year I got $716 billion. And our enemies look at us much differently now than they looked at us two years ago.
We also, by the way -- very important to all of us -- we got $6 billion -- that's B billion -- $700 B billion, but we got $6 billion for opioid and getting rid of that scourge that's taking over our country.
And the numbers are way down. We're getting the word out -- bad. Bad stuff. You go to the hospital, you have a broken arm; you come out, you're a drug addict with this crap. It's way down. We're doing a good job with it.
But we got $6 billion to help us with opioid. So, if you want strong borders -- and again, we started that wall. We have $1.6 billion for the wall. We've started the wall. And, in San Diego, they came to us -- they wanted the wall in California. And you heard the story.
I said, Don't give it them, because we lose a lot of energy. They wanted it so badly. They got tired of illegal immigrants walking across their front lawn. Can you understand that? Isn't that terrible that they got tired?
Why shouldn't they have people walking in their living room? Why? So they wanted the wall. So I said, No, let's wait. And they said, Go ahead and build it, we got a good price. So we started to build it. Then I had second thoughts because of the governor of California, who loves sanctuary cities and other things.
So he didn't want the wall. But they were putting so much pressure, so I decided to do it. Then, in the middle of doing it -- it's beautiful. It's big. Nobody is crossing it very easily. Not one of those that you can just scoot to the top. This is a real wall.
So what happened is, in the middle, like, I sort of had second thoughts. You ever have second thoughts about something? I said, You know, let's stop building the wall, because we get more pressure put on this crazy governor where the taxes are high and the crime is high. Other than that, he's doing a fantastic job, OK?
In California -- I have property in California that I don't care about anymore. When you do this job, there's only one thing that matters. That's getting it done properly. It doesn't matter -- getting it done. Who cares? Who cares if you have property? Big deal.
So I said, Let's stop building the wall. I said, How much would it cost? Because I know too much about contractors. I think half the room is contractors. Look at these people. I can tell a contractor. I can smell a contractor, believe it or not. There are a lot of contractors in this room.
So I said, Find out how much it would cost to stop. And one of the generals said, Sir, it wouldn't cost anything to stop. I said, Really? Find out. When he came to me, he said, It's $7 million to stop.
I'd said, All right, keep building it, OK? I'm not going to stop it for that, right? We got to get it done. So we're doing the wall. We started the wall. But we want to do -- we need about 700 miles of wall. It's 2,000 miles. We need about 700 miles of wall. We're getting it. We have a lot of natural barriers that are better than any wall you could build.
But we're getting it. And, for those people -- remember I used to say, And who's going to pay for the wall? And these guys all think, Wow, we finally have them. Because Mexico said they're not going to pay for the wall.
What does that mean? What does that mean? We're renegotiating NAFTA. Remember what I said. We are having -- we are having -- you remember I said to Tennessee, I said to everyone -- we have such a bad deal with Mexico. We have such a bad deal with Canada. We lose with Mexico over $100 billion a year with this crazy NAFTA deal.
One -- think of it. It's impossible. We lose $100 billion a year, and that doesn't include the billions of dollars of drugs that flow into our country. That's not included. That's probably another $100 billion, probably more than that. And it's really destroying our youth. We're going to stop it and we have been stopping it.
And immigration is down much, but we need border wall. We need -- we got to have a change in our laws. Our laws are the worst laws of any country anywhere in the world -- catch and release. Did you ever hear?
You catch, you take their name and you release. Great. Wonderful. Then they are supposed to show up to a court. There's only one problem: They never show up. So we're working on it. We're having a real problem.
The Democrats want to use it as a campaign issue. And I keep saying, I hope they do. The fact is the Democrats are lousy politicians. They are lousy on policy.
I happen to think them allowing open borders, which we don't allow anyway -- but they make it very difficult -- but them allowing open borders -- that's a good issue for us, not to them. I really -- but the one thing they do -- the one thing they do is they stick together. It's always like 48, 49. Nobody leaves in the Senate.
They stick together. They always vote, like, 100 percent. OK? So we need more Republicans. We're going to get them. We're going to get the wall done anyway.
Mexico, I don't want to cause a problem. I don't want to cause it. But, in the end -- in the end, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. I'm just telling you.
All right. I don't want to cause any problem. But in the end Mexico is paying for the wall. They make all of this money and they do absolutely nothing to stop people from going through Mexico from Honduras and all these other countries -- the caravan, all of this stuff -- they do nothing to help us. Nothing. They're going to pay for the wall and they're going to enjoy it. OK?
They're going to enjoy it. They do nothing for us. So, if you want strong voters, and if you want -- not only that; we have to do something with the lottery. We have to do something with chain migration.
We have a guy in New York a year ago -- he ran over and killed eight people, right? Eight people, and nobody ever talks about the people that were injured. Do you ever notice? They say, eight people who died, well, about 12 are just horribly injured. They lose an arm. They lose a leg.
These are people that are running alongside of the Hudson River, which I know so well. And they are running. And this maniac takes his car, he's driving fast, he goes, he knocks off as many people as he can. Eight people killed, many people badly injured -- missing a leg, missing an arm. Can you imagine?
These are people different from me in the sense that they want to run. I don't want to run. They want to run. And they go and they work hard. And they want to look good. And they come home because of this maniac and others like them. Look at what's going on all over the world. Look at what's going on -- look at what's happening to Europe.
So they go. And they take this man, right? And he got here and he's got 22 people that came in -- his mother, his father, his grandmother, his uncle, his brother, his sister. He got -- 22 people come in for this one guy. That's called chain migration -- 22 people.
And then, of course, you have the wonderful lottery system that was started by Chuck Schumer, or -- sometimes referred to as Crying Chuck Schumer, right? I know him for so many years. I know him from New York so long.
Crying Chuck -- remember, he was crying. He was so sad. He got up, he was crying. He was working those tears. He was trying so hard. He was trying so hard that, actually, they weren't tears. It was sweat. He was sweating.
So Crying Chuck wanted to have a lottery system. Think of it, a lottery. You pick people. Now, let me ask you. So these countries that are sending people in -- do you think they are sending us their finest? Do you think they are sending us -- so we got the lottery.
So they put names, and we pick the names, and they come in, and then we wonder why we have problems. We're not going to be a stupid country anymore. We've stopped it. We're not going to be.
And you can say what you want, but I think border security and security in general is a great issue for the Republican Party. I think it's a great issue. Not a bad issue.
So, if you want the strong voters, if you want crime to stop -- and, by the way, as a country, we have it way down. But then you take a look at a place like Chicago. What the hell is that mayor doing? What is he doing?
But we have -- crime is down in the country. But we need Republicans, and we need to get out and vote for Marsha. If you want your communities to be safe, if you want your schools to be safe, if you want your schools to be safe , if you want your country to be safe, then you must go out and get the Democrats the hell out of office, because there's no common sense.
And we're going to defend our borders, and we're going to fight hard on crime. We're not going to let what's happened over the last long period of time -- been going on for a long time. We have borders down 40 percent, and it's tough because our economy is doing so well. More people try to get in, so it makes it even tougher.
But the other thing is we are going to protect your Second Amendment. You won't have a Second Amendment if the Democrats take over. You won't have a Second Amendment. You won't have a Second Amendment.
So, last week, I visited a place where -- I essentially grew up right next to it -- to discuss the menace of MS-13. This vicious gang has transformed once peaceful, beautiful communities that I know so well -- I know them all -- into bloodstained killing fields, savagely murdering, raping and mutilating their victims.
And they don't even want to do it with a gun. They talk about gun control. They don't want to do it with a gun. They want to do it with knives. They want to cut people up into little pieces because it's more painful.
And then I have to listen to Pelosi and these people saying, We have to respect them. They are human beings. They are not human beings. They're not human beings. And this is why we call the bloodthirsty MS-13 gang members exactly the name that I used last week. What was the name? [Audience calls out 'Animals']
Animals. MS-13 takes advantage of glaring loopholes in our immigration laws to infiltrate our country. That's what they do. Think of it. We're bringing them out by the thousands, but they come in. We're bringing them out by the thousands. In Long Island, we have guys in border patrol. And we have guys in ICE -- and women, fantastic women and brave and tough and strong -- but we have the people in ICE.
They go around and grab MS-13. And the beauty is, they are much tougher than these gang members. And they see these people. And they say, Man, and they throw them into the paddy wagons. And the towns -- this is Long Island, where I grew up.
You have the same kind of communities. But, for some reason, so many in Long Island -- it's like they've been liberated, like from a war. It's like the enemy has been taken out and the people are dancing and they're waving and they are looking out their windows and they are waving to the ICE people. Those people are incredible, brave, tough people. They've been liberated.
Terrible. If you would have told me 30 years ago, 20 years ago, that could happen to Long Island, I would have said, No way. But that's what happened. But think of it. It's like these towns have been liberated.
Yet, in the face of MS-13 and its threat, Washington, Democrats voted against legislation to remove these criminal aliens. They voted against Kate's Law. And they voted in favor of sanctuary cities that protect criminals. And they voted in favor catch and release. OK?
So Democrats have opposed every common-sense measure necessary to stop this horrendous scourge of crime, to dismantle MS-13 and to stop illegal immigration. That's why we have to go in November. You have to work with Marsha. We have to get the votes. We need the votes. They stick together. They'll always vote.
Phil -- whatever the hell his name is -- this guy will 100 percent vote against us every single time. I have Democrats come up to me. I love you, President. I love the job. I'm with you, President. Some of these states, I won by 44 points. And they're afraid that, if I go there, which I will -- so they're telling me all sorts. They're actually saying good things.
Democrats running for office -- many of them are saying great things about me. In fact, I think they're Republicans. But here is the problem: They're not going to vote for us. No matter what they say, doesn't matter.
The only thing that matters -- they don't have to say anything. The only thing that matters is will they raise their hand. They will never raise their hand, because I told you, they are bad at everything, but they are good at sticking together.
They are good at sticking -- I give them respect for that. They are good at sticking together. It's the only thing they are good at. We support the rule of law and we support the heroes of law enforcement. Thank you.
And we defend our Constitution. And we have confirmed -- we've got now through confirmation a record number of judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, as written.
We have pride in our history. And we have respect for our great American flag. We put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance. Put our hands on our hearts. And we always proudly stand for our national anthem. Thank you. What's that all about?
Guided by these shared values, we've already accomplished more than anyone ever dreamed possible. A year and a half -- that's all it is. We have not let you down. I'll never let you down, never. We passed the largest tax cuts and reform in American history.
Larger than Ronald Reagan, many years ago. And you know? When I got involved, I said, You got to help me with this, because why have you never been able to pass tax cuts? You might have heard the story. And they said to me, Sir, I don't know. We just can't pass them.
I said, Can I see a few of these bills over the years? I looked at one from 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 30 years ago. But it doesn't say Tax cut. It says the Tax Reform Act of 1994, tax reform. It says things -- what does reform mean? It might mean you pay more taxes.
It didn't say cuts. So I meet with the politicians, and they've been doing it much longer than me. Remember that I've only been doing it for a couple of years, right? But we have common sense.
I said, Wait a minute. When you pass the tax reform act of whatever year, nobody knows it's tax cuts. Well, I think they do. Great, let's give everybody an education. We're going to give 350 million people an education. You got to call it the Tax Cut Act. The Tax Cut Act.
And then said -- good people -- well, meaning they want to pass it -- really good people -- Kevin Brady, a lot of great people, knowledgeable -- they said, Sir, what would you like to name it? I said, I'll tell you, and I'm being serious about it. I want it to be called the Tax Cut, Cut, Cut, Cut Plan. Four cuts.
And we all agreed that was a little bit hokey, so we decided not to do that. But we call it the Tax Cut Act, OK? And it was -- and I don't say easy. I don't say easy -- and then, of course, repeal and replace Obamacare.
But what -- we had it done, folks. It was done, and then, early in the morning, somebody turned the hand in the wrong direction. That cost our country a lot. That was a very, very terrible thing that happened that night. That was a very terrible thing.
That cost our country $1 trillion in entitlement saving that nobody would have known. It would have given us a good health care plan and that cost us a lot. And nobody knew that was going to happen, because we had it done.
Repeal and replace. And the person that voted that way only talked repeal and replace. He campaigned on it. So I'll tell you this. I'll tell you this. To get that, we are coming up with great health care.
Our secretary of labor is coming out with a plan in two weeks -- association plan. Going to be great. Our secretary of health, Alex -- we have Alex Acosta, you know that. I have my two Alexes.
Both my Alexes are coming out with plans that are phenomenal plans, phenomenal plans, Alex Azar, Alex Acosta. And they'll be out over the next four weeks.
It's going to cover a tremendous amount of territory. Plus, in the tax cuts, what did we get? The individual mandate is out the window. That was the most unpopular part of Obamacare .
So unconstitutional. That was where you have the privilege of paying a lot of money so that you don't have to pay for health care because you're not going to get it, OK? So you pay not to have to pay for health care, in other words, you're not going to get health care. You pay for the privilege, they give it.
You pay for the -- every time I think of this, you pay for the privilege of not getting health care -- great. That's a great one. I love that. That was an Obama special. Who would think of that? Who would think of it? So we got rid of the individual mandate.
We also got ANWR in Alaska in tax cut plan. Friend of mine called, they said, You know, that's amazing, ANWR. He's in the oil business. Successful guy. He goes, I can't believe it. They've been trying to get ANWR. That's a massive find.
It's been for years and years they haven't been able to get it approved. And I wasn't pushing it too hard, to be honest with you, because I was more focused on the tax cuts. He called up, he goes, Is it true that you're trying to get ANWR and you'll maybe get it? I said, Yes. Who cares? It's the biggest, like, the biggest find. It's like phenomenal.
I said, Why do you ask? He said, Well, you know, every president -- Bush. Bush -- $7 trillion in the Middle East -- great, great, great investment. A lot of death, death and blood and money -- horrible, Bush. Everybody tried to get -- so he said, People have been trying to get that approved since Ronald Reagan.
I said, What about Reagan? He tried also. They failed. When I heard that, I said, You got to get ANWR approved. And we got it approved as part of the -- I never knew it was such a big deal. It's actually a big deal. And the people of Alaska, who are great -- they're working on it right now. They're moving it along.
Last week, we passed new landmark legislation to give choice to our great veterans. It's going through. We're going to have it. It's going to be incredible. We're going for choice. Haven't finished the process yet, but it's happening -- choice.
You know, before I knew too much about the V.A., I used to say, We're going to take care -- these are our great people. They are, in many cases, in pretty rough shape. They'd have to wait for a doctor for three weeks, four weeks, for 16 days, for a week, sometimes for months. They go on to line with something that could be easily cured; three months later, they haven't seen a doctor and they're terminally ill. OK?
And I said, We have to help. And I didn't know too much about it. But I said, You know what makes sense to me? They wait for the doctors, they can't get in. You know what makes sense to me? Let them go out to a private doctor who's looking for business, and let the government pay. Right?
And I went to the so-called experts and they said, Yes, we've been trying to do that for years. I said, I see. So it's not like an odd idea. No, we've been trying, but we can't get it passed. We're very close to getting it fully passed. Choice. Choice.
We also did something else. That -- the V.A. -- our veterans -- we got the V.A. Accountability Act. Do you know what that is? Do you know what that is? Now, we all love the unions. We all love civil service. But the power that they have -- you couldn't get it.
For years and decades, they've tried to get accountability, so people wouldn't treat our vets badly. You had sadists. You had people that would -- would be terrible to our vets, and you couldn't fire them.
You had people that would steal, they'd rob. You'd catch them, you couldn't fire them. And I had what's called the V.A. Accountability Act. Nobody thought I could get it through -- nobody -- because of the unions. Hey, I understand -- and because of civil service, which is very powerful.
We got it through. I signed it a couple of months ago. Right? And now, when somebody steals or when some sicko hurts our great veterans, we look them in the eye and we say, Jim, you're fired. Get out of here. Get out.
And they're gone. They're gone. They're gone. V.A. Accountability Act -- I'm proud of that one. Nobody talks about it. By the way, these guys don't talk about it. They never talked about it.
They never talk. They don't even talk about it. Something good happened -- they don't want it. And it's mostly good, I will tell you. They don't want to talk about it. This month, just like I promised during the campaign, the United States officially opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
Good. That's good. Here's just a quick story. I really understand now why it was never approved by everybody that ran for office -- every president, both parties in running. They said, We're going to open the embassy in Jerusalem. We're going to recognize Jerusalem as the capital. We're opening the -- OK, this was their campaign, the politicians. This is their campaign over and over. Many, many presidents.
But not one -- because you're fired, yes. They got fired. I guess you're right. They're not here. But not one did it. And I thought that was terrible, because you see them campaigning -- it's one of their many points. But we're going to open the embassy in Jerusalem, over and over and over. Now it comes time -- one of them wins. They never do it, right? They never did it. And now I know why.
Because, two weeks out, when people sort of started to think that we're going to open up the embassy, I was called by every leader in the world. Don't do it. Don't do it. We don't want it. Don't do it. Don't -- and I understood. The pressure not to open it was tremendous, and we did it, and we did the right thing. We did the right thing.
And, after -- I'll tell you a little business story, fast one. But, after it was approved, I told the generals -- and John Bolton is here some place. Where's John Bolton? Great John Bolton. They think he's so nasty and so tough that I have to hold him back, OK? It's pretty great.
And he's doing a great job. You better get some rest, because we have pretty good negotiations coming up. He's here with his daughter, who lives, by the way, in Tennessee -- so happy.
So I say, I want to build it. We just got it approved. It was a big deal. I want to build it. And they said, Yes, sir. So I get this, you know, executive order -- this big, beautiful piece of paper. It must have cost, like, a fortune.
Like, even -- look, for my speech, I haven't used it yet, but (inaudible). So beautiful. Leather -- most expensive leather money can buy, you know. Thing probably cost $2,000. Look, it's got the seal. Remind me to take it when I leave. It's so beautiful.
But I have this executive -- and I'm getting ready to sign it. I signed Donald. I say, What is this, general? I'm signing so much stuff. What is this, general? Sir -- because they're -- I love these generals. They're much better fighters of wars, believe me, than they are negotiators for money. Sir, this is the new embassy in Israel. It's for your approval, sir. The cost will be $1 billion.
I said, Wait a minute. What? What? $1 billion. I said, $1 billion? How can it cost $1 billion? It's like a one-story building. Sir, we estimate the cost to be $1 billion. We're going out to buy land. We're going to do this.
Well, in the meantime, it won't open for 30 years, you know, they all say. So I called my head, my great diplomat, my representative, David Friedman, right? To Israel from the United States, our Ambassador, David. I said hey, David, David, I got a problem. I can't spend a billion dollars on building an embassy. I just can't -- not that the country can't. I just can't do it up here, you know, mentally. I can't do it.
It's like a one-story building. They want to go out and overpay for a piece of land that's in a bad location, like they did, by the way, in London before I got there. I said, David, I can't do it. Now, David was a great lawyer, great businessman, very successful, one of the most successful lawyers.
He said, Let me look into it. He calls me back two days later, says, Sir. What? Sir, we can build the embassy for $150,000. Now you got to understand. I said, What are you talking about, $150,000?
He said, We can build the embassy, sir, for $150,000. We have the best piece of land that we already own. We have a building on that piece of land. Its set back, it's a very big piece. Many acres. It's in the best location. And what I want to do, sir, is take the corner of that big, beautiful building and carve it up, and we can build an embassy for $150,000.
So you know what I told him? I got a little extravagant. I said, David, make it for $400,000. OK. So think of it. So we opened up -- and here's the other thing. And, sir, we can have the embassy built in about three months. That's incredible, as opposed to 20 years.
So here's the deal. $1 billion, land we don't own, will take forever to get it open. It'll never open. And then, in addition to all of the people who will try and stop you -- and that's a billion dollars as opposed to a better location for $400,000. I said, Spend more, please.
You know, sometimes something can cost so little, it's ridiculous, right? So we opened it. It is totally beautiful. The finest stones, the finest marbles, the best location.
It's open. It opened in four months after we started building. We had the dedication ceremony. But that's government. By the way, I could tell you a hundred stories like that. These stories are crazy.
So, instead of spending $1 billion and not having it for 20 years, we spent 400,000 bucks and it opened up in a few months. Is that good? Is that a good story?
And I think it probably is better. Somebody said, Well, it won't be. I said, Yes, I think the big difference -- it's probably better, OK? So that was the story.
But, in order to ensure the other big move -- the Iranian regime never obtains nuclear weapons. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal three weeks ago. Instead of apologizing for America, which we always do, we are finally standing up for our great country.
And that's why, in November, we will reverse a trend. When you win the presidency, for some reason, you always end up losing the House, losing the -- it happens like 90 percent of time, makes absolutely no sense.
But I think what happens is you get complacent. You work -- all of you people in this room -- some of you are friends of mine, some of you I recognize. But you worked so hard in Tennessee. They're working hard all over the country. And you win.
And now you sit back and you relax. That's the worst thing that can happen because, all of a sudden, you have another election. And this election is a very important one. This is a really important election, so you have to get out. We need Marsha Blackburn to win.
And it's going to be a very special time. So we'll deliver all of our citizens -- we'll deliver all of our promises. Together, we will lift up our country. We'll lift up millions and millions of Americans from welfare to work, from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity. And that's what we're doing. That's what we're doing. Remember when I'd make a speech and I'd talk about African American -- and I'd say, Highest crime rate, bad education -- I go up like 10 points.
And they're always voting -- African Americans vote for Democrats for the most part. You know, vast majority. They've been doing it for over a hundred years. And I said, Highest crime, bad education, bad this, bad that. And what did I say? What the hell do you have to lose? And, now, we have numbers coming out that are so fantastic... [Applause] ... for Hispanic, for African American. Thank you. Right? Right?
And I fulfilled -- but we have just started. We have just started. Because we're going to build new airports. We've become like a third world country. You look at our airports.
You go to places like Saudi Arabia and other places, or China -- go to some of these countries, and you'll see things that you've never seen before. We used to be the leader. We're going to build new airports. We're going to build new highways.
We're going to build new dams. We're going to build infrastructure. We just had approved recently -- we just had approved -- we're fixing up all of our airports. Billions of dollars just got approved, and I'm signing shortly.
We will build new strengths into our country. We will breathe new hope into our communities. And we will do it all with these big, beautiful hands. Look at these hands. Because we've got more capability, we've got more grit, and we've got a thing called American pride, and nobody has it like us.
Loyal citizens like you, the people of Tennessee, helped build this country. And, together, we are taking back our country. We're returning the power back to our great American patriots.
This great state was forged through the sweat and courage of tough frontier men and strong frontier women who braved the elements and defied the dangers to carve out a home in the wilderness. Not easy.
Generations of proud patriotic Tennessee pioneers -- these are incredible people. Your relatives, who love their families, love their country, and love their God, made this beautiful state into their beloved home.
This is the state of country music, of Nashville legends we love -- we love those legends -- and of Memphis blues. It's the state of Andrew Jackson, a great president and a great general, by the way.
It's the state of David Crockett and Sergeant York. And, this November, this is the state where America's comeback will continue full speed ahead. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who have -- what we have done -- what we have done.
We have beaten empires. We have tamed continents. We've triumphed over the worst evils in history. We have triumphed over evil like nobody's ever seen before. Our ancestors -- they crossed the oceans. They blazed the trails. They climbed the mountains and created the modern world with their own two hands.
We're the nation that built the Empire State Building in less than one year and the Golden Gate Bridge and the incredible Panama Canal, which we gave away -- which we gave away -- we won two world wars. We defeated communism and fascism.
And we put a man on the face of the moon. And you see what's happening with NASA, see those rocket ships starting to go up again. A lot of jobs, a lot of great stuff happening with NASA.
As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never, ever fail -- never fail. I say it, and I say it all the time. We are so respected again. I can't even tell you the -- really, the degree to which people respect our country again. It's amazing. It's amazing.
With your help, with your voice and with your vote, we will win, win, win. We will achieve victory for our magnificent land, the land that we love, because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We will never give in.
We will never give up. And we will never stop fighting for our country, for our flag, and for our great, beautiful freedom. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God.
Without a question, without a doubt, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you very much. God bless you. We love you. Thank you. God bless you everybody.
Wow. Thank you. Thank you everybody. I know so many people in this room. This is a room I really know that people, there's no question about it. Mike, I just want to thank you. I've known Mike so long and it's -- I knew when he was a young, handsome, beautiful guy. Now he's a little older but still handsome right.
But thank you, Mike. It's a great honor having the Conservative Party. And just so you understand we are going to play New York. You know we're not just doing this for fun. We're going to play New York. And I want to wish the best to Wendy and I've watched Wendy over the years and know Wendy and she's a terrific woman and she's gonna be fighting hard and I think she's going to surprise a lot of people.
So Wendy wherever you may be back there, right there. Great. Great luck. You're going to do very well. I want to just thank a few people that are here. I assume that we have Carl Paladino somewhere. Where's Carl? Carl. John J. We have and Joe from Nassau we have, and we have I think Ed, I don't know. Is Ed here?
Ed Cox. Where's Ed? Where's Ed? Where the heck is Ed. Ahh. Hello, Ed. We're going to play it, Ed. OK. We're going to play we're also going to do those others that you told me about but we're going to -- I think we're going to do very well. I think we're going to do very well. We have been and I have been in love with this state for a long time and this is, I guess, the first time in a long time that you really have a competitive person running for president that comes from New York.
And I think we're going to do very well. The polls are looking great. We're playing a lot of states that a lot of people never thought of in terms of a Republican. I don't know maybe they're just not thinking I'm as much of a Republican as I think I am. But states are in play that are never in play for Republicans.
And you probably saw the polls coming out in the recent CNN poll that came out, I guess, this morning has us to up on Hillary. So -- So I'm a long time New Yorker. I've spent billions and billions of dollars in this state and city I've produced tremendous numbers of jobs it's been very good to me also. And we want to win it. We want to win it. And we're going to help New York.
We have to help New York because it's got very difficult problems. Taxes are too high, by far. Get a lot of great opportunities to reduce taxes yet a lot of great opportunities upstate that weren't taken advantage of. You know what I mean. When I went around and won New York so big in the primary. This was the one it was just boom.
We won New York. It was a it was massive just about everything. We won just about every location every place you could be. And it was an honor and I always tell people you know winning New York by such a landslide against very capable people in the primaries. That was an honor for me because nobody knows me better than New Yorkers.
I say it's always bad. [Applause] Always bad, never good when you lose your state and you lose it badly. So we won it in a landslide and just won every area of it. And with the help of all of the folks I just mentioned -- and Carl and I were just talking we're going to make a very, very heavy play upstate.
We're going to do unbelievably well. I see the ads. I don't know how much money they spent on that ad but I guarantee you the money would have been better spent doing something else because I don't think a lot of people have signed up but I'm hearing numbers like hundreds of millions of dollars. I've never seen an ad that's been on so much in so long.
But it's a -- it's an ad nevertheless about bringing your business to New York. Right. And you've all seen it. And I just wonder how much business has been gotten from that ad. Mike, how much business has been gotten from that Ad? Would you rather have the ad money or the business that's been gotten?
I'd take the money.
You'd take the money. Come here. Get over here. This is like old home week. Come here. Say something.
It's nice to have the president of the United States from New York but also a Westchester resident. Thank you.
Take care of yourself. Nice to see you Rob. A good man. He's gonna do very well. Gonna do very, very well. So over the years, I've watched a lot of bad things happen, a lot of good things happen. But I've watched upstate. I've watched out on the island. I've watched businesses leave and I think one of the reasons I'm standing here instead of somebody else is that frankly, we have really hit a chord with jobs and we've also had it with illegal immigration.
Lots of different things. The military, in fact I'm going from here, I'm going over to NBC, we're doing an interview with Matt Lauer. Sure that'll be a lot of fun. That'll be a lot, a lot of fun. Sure it'll be very fair. And maybe it will be -- hey, he's a good guy. Maybe it will be. Let's see. Well let's you know.
Right. But I just you know I it's so sad when I toured the state during the primaries and I got to see every part of the state I was in Syracuse and I was in Albany and I was everywhere, and I saw those great beautiful buildings that were empty and rotting and falling down from the wind and the rain and the snow and they're all over the state and there's no hope, there's no hope other than if I become president because they will be great.
They will be great. Because we're going to bring our jobs back to New York. We're going to bring our jobs back to our country. But we're going to bring our jobs back to New York. What happened is so sad. Those companies have moved to Mexico and other places but a lot of them moving to Mexico. I tell this story I have a friend who builds plants.
That's what he does he builds plants, probably he had to build an apartment house, maybe he wouldn't know where. But I'll tell you, this is a great guy. I think he's just about the biggest in the world that doing this. And I say to him, "How are you doing? How's business?" He said, "Unbelievable." "Oh, good.
Where are you building mostly?" "Mexico." "Oh, that's not so good. That's not so good." Well, why? He said, "Donald what we're doing in Mexico is the eighth wonder of the world." The eighth wonder of the world, think of that. This is a man who builds these massive factories and car plants etc. He said it's unbelievable when you see what's happening.
I said, "How you're doing in the United States?" where he's from and where he really would like to be doing the building. He goes, "Mah, not so good." And he said, "But you have to come to Mexico." I just left Mexico, by the way. That worked out very well. And I don't blame Mexico for doing what they're doing.
I mean I respect Mexico. I have great respect for the leaders and the president was very, very nice. But you know our businesses were building -- our businesses just pouring -- it's just pouring into Mexico and other places. And then China in a different way, they're making our product and they're dumping it all over.
You look at what's happening with our steelworkers. You look at what's happened with our miners and all of the -- It's just incredible what's happening to our country. And we've got to stop it and we will stop it. By the way, 100% we will stop it. We're not going to let this continue to happen. So -- So I just have to say, it's been such an honor to be involved for so long with a conservative party, with the Republican Party too.
Ed, I couldn't forget you. I would be in trouble if I forgot him. But for tonight the Conservative Party, I've been a supporter, I've been a supporter of Mike's for a long time. And we're going to do a great job. You know it's a little bit like fixing the country, fixing the state. We have to fix it. When I last time -- when I was with the Republicans at the Grand Hyatt, which I built, I told the story of the Wollman Rink.
How it was closed for eight years, a total disaster. The city couldn't get it built. They had no clue. They had engineers that came from Miami. You don't want an engineer for a ice skating rink that comes from Miami. And they couldn't make ice. And they try and they had copper tubing and it was going miles and miles and miles and they'd lay it. And the next day it would be stolen and then they'd lay it and it will be stolen.
This went on for years. Right. They'd lay it down, copper was -- wasn't this very expensive. And what happened is I went to Koch, Ed Koch, the mayor of New York, I said, "Mr. Mayor, my kids are growing up. I want them to be able to ice skate at least once before they're at a point where they don't want to ice skate anymore." And I see people sitting in the rink all day long.
They had two lunch breaks one in the morning one in the afternoon and there was no work and hundreds of people would be sitting on this massive slab. And when they poured the slab they poured in little chunks. OK. A lot of construction people because I have a lot of friends here. But that port in little chunks and then they come in the next day.
And by the time it was all finished they had chunks all over the place and it wasn't even. And it was like this was at a big level. So when they put the water on in one side they had like a foot and a half of water and the other one they had like an inch. And they didn't know what they were doing. And I said to Ed Koch and I went to the newspapers.
I said, you know, because they didn't want to let me do it. They didn't want to be stood up or they didn't want to be shown up and they went -- I went to the newspapers, the editorial board to actually, even though I'm much more successful now they don't treat me nearly as well. I'm trying to figure this out.
But they actually did treat me very well and they said, "Let Trump do it." And it was a lot of pressure put on and they let me do it and I did it in four months. They had spent, I think, probably 20 $21 million sometimes I hear 18, I hear 17, honestly, they had no idea what they spent. Whatever it was, they spent a fortune.
And I took it over and the first thing I did is I had to get an engineer, so I fired the guy from Miami because he obviously didn't know what he was doing. And he -- he recommended actually, he said, "Why didn't you try somebody Mr. Trump from Montreal?" I said, "That's good." And then I remember I have a friend who was involved with the Montreal Canadiens, the ice hockey team.
So I called him. I said, "Ed, can you do me a favor? You have an engine -- Do you have anybody that knows how to make ice?" Said, "Oh, I have the greatest guy." And he gave me the name. The guy came to New York really nice person and he said, "Oh, Mr. Trump this is terrible." They're using gases they're using Freon and in that pipe if you have one little pinhole one little tiny pinhole in miles and miles of pipe it'll escape and you can't make the ice.
That's a horrible thing. That stuff is meant for refrigerators not for ice skating rinks. I said that makes sense. You know on the back of the refrigerator right. Not quite, you know, 20 miles of stuff. So he said, "What you want is brine." I said, "What's brine?" He said, "Well, it's basically water with salt in it so it doesn't freeze, and you put it in rubber hoses and you make it very cold, doesn't freeze, and all of a sudden you have ice." I said, "Boy, that sounds good." So I thanked him he drew it up. I went out, I heard some really good contractors.
I got rid of all the copper there was really none left, it was mostly stolen and I put down the rubber hose. Nobody was stealing the rubber hose. Nobody stole the rubber hose. It's amazing. Rubber hose doesn't have quite the same allure. But it was rubber hose, clamps at each end. Miles and miles of rubber hose.
And we put it down quickly and beautifully. We got the right machine that froze the water and the water went through the rubber hose and we checked it for leaks because even if it leaked it wouldn't matter that much unlike the other. But I said I don't want to leak anyway. So before the concrete went down we checked in. I got a concrete guy who was great and we had trucks lined up to Harlem, all the way back to Harlem.
One contiguous pour, because that's the only way to do it. One contiguous pour. We laid the rebar and we had these trucks, they poured for 24 hours straight. It's a big surface. Massive surface, actually. And it was like perfect we laser finished it. And then we let it heal and we poured water over it. Two inches.
They said two inches is perfect and we turned on the machine and lo and behold shortly thereafter, there was ice. Amazing. Amazing And that has been a story that's been documented in the Wharton School and the Harvard Business School and all over because it's really -- it's private enterprise, free enterprise, private versus government.
And there are others you know I just did the very point job whereas saying was under construction for like 25 years or something nobody even knows you know you ask him how long. And they don't really even know that I've no idea how much they spend. And we got that when open. It's a tremendously big success in the Bronx.
But somehow the woman [Inaudible] It's just -- it's just a case study then we fix up the building, which was really easy. And I have it to this day, it's -- there's no ice rink in the world that does more business than our ice rink and it's been tremendously successful and we really have a good time and you know in a very, very large scale version, we have to do the same for New York State.
That's what we have to do. We have to bring back our businesses. We can't let our remaining businesses go. If they go and they make a product and they want to move to Mexico and they want to fire all of the employees, like they've, in all fairness, been doing. We're very late to the picture. This speech should have been made 15 years ago.
But I was doing other things I was one of those companies that was doing well in New York. But if they want to leave and if they want to make product in a different country and they want to send it over to our borders and yet fire all our people and not pay taxes and they think they're going to send that over the border, there's not going to be consequences, not going to happen.
And once you say, "Look, we hope you enjoy your stay in Mexico or wherever. It's a beautiful location and you're building a lovely looking plant. But every time you make you a product and you think you're going to send it over, what will be very soon a very strong border, you will pay a 35% tax every single time you send your product over." And I'll tell you, it's very late in the game, unfortunately.
But this should have been done years ago and you would've had nobody leave. Because two things are going to happen. Number one, they're not going to leave. That's about 95%. And then if they do that's OK too because we're going to make a fortune. OK. But they're not going to leave and nobody wants to do this because these people and these politicians are all controlled by the special interests that own the companies that want to move to other countries and make lots of money.
And that's the way it is. So we're going to bring our businesses back. We are going to make sure that they're going to come back into New York, in New York State. I'm tired when I looked out in Suffolk and different places on Long Island when I made that tour. I couldn't believe what I saw. I couldn't believe it, actually.
I've been here all my life. I couldn't believe it. The devastation that has happened in this state. I couldn't believe it. So we're going to turn things around. We're going to bring back our jobs. We're going to bring back companies. And we're going to start a lot of new companies but not with an ad. We're going to start it by having low taxes and being smart.
And I just want to tell you, folks, I'm being 100% serious. You know everybody would say, "Oh, don't bother with New York because Republicans don't win New York." I don't think that we're going to be in that position. I think we're going to win New York. I think we're going to do great in New York. Don't forget Hillary.
She's not a New Yorker and, by the way, in Arkansas and she's really not from Arkansas either, but in Arkansas, what do have, a 25-point lead. I have a 25-point lead. You know she is from Arkansas but she's really from Illinois. So yeah. Thank you. I'm a real New Yorker, folks. I will say this. You will never get more of a New Yorker if you want a president than you're getting with me. So I want to thank Mike.
I want to thank the Conservative Party. I want to thank everybody in this room. I want to thank my son Eric Trump, who has been working and his wife Laura. And we have so many supporters but I just want to say to you we are going to play so hard. We are going to play so hard and win. We're going to win this state.
It's going to shock people. And by the way, you know if we win this state, it's over, we win. OK. We win. So I appreciate the endorsement of Mike, always. I really appreciate being given this great honor by the Conservative Party and I will tell you, Mike, get up here for one second. Come here, come here, come here.
I want to thank you, man. Do a hell of a job for this man. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, Carl.

You know, thank you very much. Wow what a lot of welcome. It's a terrific place. Terrific. We just got in and we were driving. I'm driving through these beautiful fields I want to grab that corn like you've never seen so rich so beautiful. And thank you for being here on a Saturday. I know you can be doing a lot of other I mean we have such a huge crowd.
We have another room that's packed like this one and people standing outside. They I don't know we can let them in if we can put them up but we had so many people standing outside. I just want to thank you. And actually the Des Moines Register is standing outside to us some. Sort of funny. So it was sort of funny.
So you know it's a super liberal rag not respected around here but they come out with an editorial. Mr. Trump I'm rated number one now in every poll because you know what people are tired of what's gone up because of me get tired and they said so you number one in every poll and they say you should drop your candidacy I say Excuse me. I mean you know why.
But it's such an honor to be here and to discuss some of the things that taken place over the last week. This has been a big week. First of all Hillary is now officially under investigation for the emails. Big big you know if you look at it. Look I don't think anything's going to happen to her because it's all Democrats that are doing the investigation.
I mean. It's the way it is. Right. And. You look at you look at the prosecutors are all Democrats and they want jobs and they want to continue onward. And. You know the attorney general is a Democrat right. Oh that's different. I agree with that. But I say you have all of these people and it's just a game that goes on in Washington it's terrible what's going on and you look at General Petraeus as an example so he was a general did a very good job although I don't know you know that whole thing is such a disaster with what's going.
But he did a good job and he was a respected guy and he did much less than Hillary much less in terms of information in terms of importance in terms of volume. I mean he gave a little bit. You talked about years and years and thousands of emails and they destroyed his life. His life is over. They've destroyed him.
He's like a ruined man. I saw him. He's like a ruined demand. And. With Hillary she's supposed to be running and she's favored to win not against me she's not favorite. I'll tell you that. But she's favorite to win. So. Look if the prosecutors are honorable. And they may be if they're fair if they're just sadly bad stuff has to happen because what she did is very criminal and very serious and it's too bad it's too bad.
And I don't I don't know how a person with that cloud over their head actually can be running for the office of president. You know you wouldn't think so. So we'll see what happens it'll be very interesting. And you don't hear that talk from other politicians it's almost like they have you know even these Republican guys that I'm running against it's like you're not going to hear that.
You know they protect each other because they say that could be them. That could be this. I've got to take it easy I don't want to me I don't care. I say the truth. So I went to Laredo and my wife came home and she was crying and I said to myself why are you crying. You made it home You made it safely from the border.
She was crying tears were coming down her face because she thought it was so dangerous. And I said to myself she either really loves me a lot or she's got a pretty good line of stuff going OK. But it was a little bit you know scary going over the border. And while I was there and by the way I have to tell you the mayor.
Pete great guy really great guy and he's a Democrat but he's a great guy. And they gave us such good treatment. The law enforcement there is unbelievable including the Border Patrol. You know they were told as I was in the air from Washington don't be there for Trump DON'T BE FOR TRUMP They're the ones that invited me the Border Patrol.
They're incredible people. And they were told in that area which you'd call a local. But there are hundreds or actually thousands of border patrol guys and women tremendous people like the people I just met outside some of the law enforcement people the sheriff some of these people are great. I'm not going to mess with them it's true.
No I looked at some of these people outside I said you know what. Nobody's messing with me today. Not with them. But. But when I went there I saw you know the mayor couldn't have been nicer. I saw the city manager Hey Suze great guy. And they gave me a whole big tour of a lot of different things. And the Border Patrol people were told not to be there from Washington.
They were told from Washington. I wonder who told them I won't. But they said don't be there. And you know by the end of the trip many many Border Patrol people came to see me anyway. I mean they actually disobeyed orders then I actually made a third stop that wasn't anticipated right by the airport. And I spoke to law enforcement and a lot of the Border Patrol.
The reason they wanted me to be there. You know it's pretty simple especially down in the valley. It's really dangerous. It's really really dangerous. There's the border. Remember I made the statement about Mexico is sending in people who come in every year so what a horrible thing. Well now I've been I have journalists calling me up I have people calling me up saying We apologize.
I was right. And then And then of course you had Kate beautiful Kate incredible family the mother the father the brother Brad. They're incredible people I spoke to him and you have these people and they are living in hell. They lost this incredible person shot as you know the story very well shot by an illegal immigrant that came over.
Had to know he was forced over or he came over five times and then the fifth time was disastrous for a family and for a country frankly. And Jamiel the football player. Young boy incredible father Jamiel Shaw who I got to know. Unbelievable kid. And he was coming home he's walking home from the deli. A few minutes away from the house and his father tells the staff I everybody even the reporters I knew some hard veteran reporters and there's tears coming down their eyes we had a conference in California a couple of weeks ago with six families who lost their children to illegal immigrants.
It's a big problem. Such a big problem. And nobody wants to talk about it. Suc h a big problem in the case of Jamiel applying to Stanford. Excellent player good student. Incredible parents and father who I got to know the father really well and he was five minutes away and this guy just walks up to him and shoots him and after he's down he takes a gun and shoots him again and he didn't do anything fact he called his father because his father affectionately like my kids he said old man he used to call a moment old man I'll be home in about four minutes and right after that a minute later the father heard a shot and he said Oh no no that can't be and his son was laying there shot by. An animal an animal that shouldn't have been in this country and people coming across the border coming from many places not just Mexico I mean they're coming from many places and you know they tried to put on Mexico I love the Mexican people I have such a great eye.
Thousands of people over the years thousands of people from Mexico from all over Hispanics that worked for me. They'r e incredible people they work hard they're great people. And Mexico is a country I respect and I've said this. The problem is that their leaders are too smart too cunning they're just better.
They negotiate better. They're tougher. They're much smarter than our leaders our leaders are dummies. They don't know what's happening. It's true. No they're incompetent. They're incompetent. Along with our sanctuary cities nobody even heard the term. And frankly I hate to brag. If it wasn't for me you would still never have heard of the word sanctuary city.
I hate to tell you that and you know things that we never even heard about. And what's happening is there's a movement going on folks. You know there's a movement going on and it's a very strong movement. We want to take back this country. We have to take it back. We have to take it. APPLAUSE AND Baxley one of the very big reporters call me and actually use the word movement because as you know they just came out the economist just kept very highly respected business magazine very respected poll and they just came out and I think I'm at 28 and Walker is at 14. And we'll talk about Walker in a second because that's the whole big story but Walker's at 14. I think Bush's at 13 28 and saying what's going on some movement.
I'm telling you so. So when I was in Laredo I met some incredible people and I'm watching and I'm watching thousands and thousands of trucks and buses and cars. Basically it's a gate. It's a gateway into Mexico. And I asked people that were their experts because they were giving me like a whole big Charette.
And I asked some of the people said so let me guess because I was looking at these cars just flowing and trucks flowing into Mexico. And again I respect Mexico for this. I like Mexico for this. I just wish our leaders were the same. I'm not knocking them. I don't not China because they outsmart our country.
They make we rebuilt China with the money they drained out of our country. We rebuilt it. That doesn't mean you know the largest bank in the world is my tenant. How could I dislike China. They pay me a lot of money. Through Chinese bank. The biggest so much bigger. I said How does it compare to Citibank.
That is like a small subsidiary. That's what they told a small subsidiary. Now I have the lar gest bank in the world I sell millions and millions of dollars. I mean when I sell a condo for 25 million to a man from China for 45 million for 30 million for 10 million for 5 million to China am I going to dislike them I love them but their leaders are much smarter than our latest.
Same thing with Mexico where they make a fortune. And I respect that people said I don't like Mex I love Mexico. I just want our country to be well represented. You know free trade is a good thing. But the one problem with free trade is you have to have really smart leaders and you have have to have great negotiators because what being killed were being killed in negotiation so while I was at Laredo I noticed something very unusual I said.
Number one I saw that traffic was so massive and it was so nice to me they stopped the traffic for while I'm there to do me a favor let those poor people go. They said no no we want to stop. Let them go. They go into Mexico to spend money. But here's what happened. So while whether you probably read it it was in Drudge who's great by the way Drudge is amazing.
But the story on Drudge and big stories all over the place now guys swimming across in big bags of stuff trucks swimming across the river right. Swimming right across. And they put the drugs and actually the camera crew or the reporters were. Petrified because they thought they were gonna be killed. Because they have chosen this on camera.
The guys carrying bags of stuff. It was drugs. And then ABC the big one I always got ABC at 630 but the big one. And they have their cameras are setting up and two guys go running by. And there are two other people running behind them trying to catch them from the water this and this is the g ood part of the border because as they say oh the valley is much you know the Valley is that's trouble.
And I saw something that was amazing. I said to let me see the drugs come through. And what goes back cash. Oh so Mexico has the best of all worlds again out of respect. The drugs come through and the cash goes back to Mexico. So we get the worst of two ends. We lose our cash and we have drugs all over the country.
How stupid a way how stupid. Think of how stupid applause so that wouldn't happen with me. Believe me that won't happen with me. And we have you know sometimes you say sometime and it was a great experience for me. I mean told the pilots I said fly a little bit away from the border please just you know go fly a little bit inland.
But it's a whole scary thing. You know when you're afraid to walk into your own country. Pretty bad. Hard to believe. You don't have that problem in Iowa and offer it is but it's pretty rough out there. But think of it. So the drugs come in. We get the drugs bad stuff. The cash goes out. But I mean so we get it but so it's got to be straightened out.
We need a border. It's got to be strong combination of walls combinations of fence combinations of great Border Patrol. These people are great. The reason they wanted to meet me is because they want to explain how bad it was. That's all. They didn't like the way I look they liked what I said. And many of the families that testified last week before Congress whose children were killed.
I was so honored but more honored than just about anything I've done. They said if it weren't for Donald Trump nobody would even know how serious this problem is I was so honored almost all of them said. Applause. So we need borders. We have to stop illegal immigration. And by the way immigration is a great thing.
Illegal immigration is a great thing. And maybe we should speed up the process. We should definitely speed up the process. And we should take people in that a great people sort of a merit system. You know when I went to school I had like a marriage. We did good didn't you know we felt good we got an A. We got to be we got to see whatever we got but we don't have anything.
We just have people flowing in and staying and in some cases they're not people that Mexico wants because they say why should we take these people that are rough. Why should we take the certain people that are rough and put them in our prisons when the extremely dumb politicians in the United States will put them in their prisons or worse or worse will not put them in prison at all.
Well let them just roam around shooting people and killing people. OK. So then we have another thing happened this week the Iran deal. OK. You know I say I sometimes start speeches by saying we don't win anymore in this country. What a win. What was the last time we won. What a win. When did we beat China in a trade deal.
We don't win. When do we beat Japan. I mean Japan sends as millions of cars I was in Los Angeles this week I looked at some of these boats. They're the biggest boats I've been around I've seen boats the biggest boats I've ever seen. They're sending us millions of cars. We send them in all due respect weak.
Not a good trade. I love we. It's wonderful. But I'd rather be sending the cars in the way. Does it make sense to you folks. We send them cattle and in many cases as you know you've been reading they won't take our cattle because the farmers don't want it. They're always fighting to get it in. And yet they drop millions and millions of cars.
So I heard that the stat is about let's say we're 100 percent over here and we're under 20 pe rcent over here. So we're sending 19 20 percent and not as profitable stuff because it's very perishable. So we're very expensive to transport was a car you put it on the boat and it goes right. So you get you. We're sending them very perishable stuff here.
That's 20 percent. They're sending us automobiles that we have up. To our gills. So that's over here. Right. And I said to myself so easy. All you have to do is say hey look you won't take our cattle you won't take our wheat you won't take anything you don't want it because you say the farmers don't want.
OK I understand that but maybe we'll cut your cars down to the same 20 percent so we have a balance. So. All you have to do all you have to do and if you think that Hillary. Or Jeb. Or Scott Walker in all fairness we'll be able to negotiate with Japan you're wrong you're wrong. It just doesn't happen. You know it's like why is Jack Nicklaus a great golfer.
He can't even explain it. Nobody knows really why just gets something in your gut. Why are the great baseball players great why do they hit they asked Babe Ruth hit more home runs one year than the entire league pretty good. Right. And people would go up to Babe Ruth and then say Babe babe How do you hit the long ball.
And I'd say I don't know man I just swing at it. It's called talent. Talent. Well you know a business person a good one like me. But a good one. And some of the people in the audience by the way. And you know what I'm talking about I mean a good one. Just you make deals. I mean I buy things like Doral. I bought Doral.
Hundreds of acres in the middle of Miami goes up. I don't know goes up. I mean I make good deals. I could get other guys there are other guys great deals great deal makers. We don't use them. We use Carolyn Kennedy in Japan. Excuse me. She couldn't believe she got the job. They said Would you like the jobs he said really.
But she has to be good. My daughter Ivanka likes her so I think she's a nice person. When Ivanka like somebody you ever hear of Ivanka and so what we want we want people. And I tell it all the time. I know people the greatest negotiators in the world they know. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.
I know people that you've never heard of that are better than all of that's what we need negotiating for us. Now some of these people are horrible human beings. You wouldn't happen to dinner they're vicious. They're crude. They're unhappy they treat everybody badly who cares. I want them negotiating against China.
You know my applause. I mean there's so many. You take a Carl Icahn. It's a friend of mine. He'd be great. I a Carl take China. We'll be do we're going to do very well. I'll get it see. I don't even have to say do this or do that. You take Henry Kravis you take Schwartzman to it there's so many great but we don't use him.
We use people that are donors. We use people that are friendly with the lobbyists. And it's a big problem for instance I read where Jeb Bush raised over one hundred million dollars. Now if you think that those people giving him all that money aren't getting a lot. You're wrong and not always in favor of the United States.
You have China you have countries that have lobbyists. Yes I have countries that have lobbyists so they can make good. That's what everybody makes good deals. And here's the beauty of me I couldn't care less. I hire the lobby. I know these guys know I mean I know on I know the lobbyists I have them when I need something sometimes if I don't know myself you know I give it every.
When I was a businessman I get a lot of criticism. Oh but you gave to the Democrats. Who cares. I was a businessman. I kept everybody a U.S. senator calls me congratulate him. I you know I'd like to be totally idealistic and I largely am but the system we have is broken because a guy like Bush a guy like Walker all of these people are controlled by the people that give him the money.
It's true. When I give money I don't know if I need anything but two years later I'll call a guy. Yes Mr. Trump what can I do. Well you know I'm having a problem with this and that but we'll take care of it. I built the great business I built it very legally legitimately but our system is broken. We can't have that.
And I give the example of Ford have anybody heard me talking about the Ford plant should I do it again. Do you mind I just go because it's such a great example So Mexico's done a fantastic job. From an economic development standpoint not only with the trucks going back. I'm talking big. It's becoming the car capital of the world.
They do an amazing job because their people are very smart their leaders are very smart. And Ford announced that they going to move a lot of their workers out of this country. But in particular they're going to build one plant 2.5 billion dollars to put you embassy hey in Iowa 2.5 billion that would build a plant bigger than any field you have.
Is that right 2.5 billion. I said wait a minute you mean two and a half million right. They said no 2.5 bit. OK. It is 2.5 billion. So they're going to build this plant to make cars. And these cars are going to be sold all up but they're going to come into the United States. No tax no nothing what means not going to have to close up in Michigan you're going to close up another place you got to build this massive plant.
And I said so why would I do if I'm president Trump would be very easy I wouldn't even call any of the people I told you about I don't have to call Carl Icahn I'd have to call anybody. I c an do this so easy. It's too easy. I deal with a phone call. I'd call the head of Ford. And say congratulations on the new plant you're building in Mexico.
I think it's a wonderful thing. Congratulations. So thank you very much Mr. President. Let me give you the bad news. Every single car and truck and part that comes into the United States we're going to tax you 35 percent. Now. Now here's what's going to happen. He says hey Mr. President Mr. President you can't do that.
Mr. President I don't care about him. I care about the country I care about the country applause. So he's going to say you can't do this you just can't do this. It's too late. We saw this it's okay. Good luck. Build your plant. I don't care. But you're not going to rip off this country. You're just not going to do it. We want jobs in the United States.
So a hundred percent. This isn't like ninety nine point nine percent. This is 100 percent here's what's going to happen. He'll call me back probably that afternoon but he may play tough and call me the next day. Does that make sense right. He may want to be done in the meantime I will have been called by different people in Washington some of whom I know but they don't give me any money I don't care about him I couldn't care less I couldn't care less.
And many of them work for me they work for me and they'll say Mr. President you know what you did with Ford is really not good. I mean they've been wonderful thing. You know there's no way I went to the Wharton School of Finance I was a really good student I know getting good for the United States right.
So these you know all of this stuff I say look I want it here. And the next day I'll get a call from the head of Ford. He'll give me one more pitch and I'll say Mr. President we've decided not to build that plant. They were going to build it in the United St ates. That's what's gonna happen. That's what's going to happen.
Now let me explain sir. That's 100 percent. I mean my only question is will it be that day or the following day. OK. That's what happens. Hundred percent. And I would make my own phone call I'd check ethics first of all. But I guess I can't be guilty of anything if I'm not doing like I don't know you know with this crazy laws now you can be guilty if you do something that's good for the United States.
You know it's a little bit tough. So check ethics. I may have to have somebody else make the call but I'll probably be able to make it myself. I have good lawyers. So what happens. So what happens I said to myself OK that's me. I say get him back Sorry I don't want to be lobbyist save me the donor see me everybody sees me I said I don't need your money I never took any of your money.
You have no control. Bye bye. Now here's what happens with President Walker. Who's state by the way is a disaster but I won't say that. Here's what happens. And I'll tell her about that second. Something happened today which was n ot nice or President Bush or President Hillary Clinton if she makes it. No. Well it's all the same to be honest with you.
It's a system. It's all the same. So they may be I mean these aren't stupid people. So they probably know that building a two and a half billion dollar plant in Mexico is not exactly the best thing that can happen to us. So they may even say let's stop that. They will be bombarded by their lobbyists that donated a lot of money to them again.
Jeb raised one hundred and seven million dollars so far. OK then putting that money up because it's like a wonderful charity although it is a charity but not for this country for other countries. They're putting that money away so their lobbyists their special interests and their donors will start calling President Bush President Clinton President Walker pretty much whoever is president.
Other than me other than me they'll say you have to do it. They can't. They gave you a million dollars to your campaign. And this one gave you five and this one you have no. You have to do it. You know what he's gonna say OK how to hire and the plant will be built in Mexico. And we just lots lots of plants all over our country.
Okay that's what's going to happen. And folks this isn't like maybe it's 100 percent this 100 percent and then the same thing happens in China. Japan is back. You know they have a really good leader smart cutting the hell out of the yen making it possible for us to compete. People are rotting Komatsu tractors now instead of Caterpillar tractors capacity.
Japan is back big lake big leg. You people know you are in the farmers as you know what I'm talking about. They're big league ordering stuff made in Japan because they've so cut their currency they've devalue their currency so quickly. Now China is an A student one currency devaluation in the history of the world there's nobody that plays with currency better than China.
And Obama has no clue here. Honestly I don't think he has a clue. I don't think. In fact in that stupid trade bill they didn't even talk about currency devaluation. And they called me up. They want to know if I'd get support if I were to pass it. Well then number one economic power. Is devaluation. What do you say about it. Nothing.
We don't talk. They said that that's their power. It's not publicity that power is exactly that. It's currency devaluation and they're genius at it and we're not. And by the way our dollars going up you know it sounds good. Our dollar is going up. Sounds good. Strong Dollar. Except for one probably kind of any business.
That's the problem. Somebody like Obama hears Oh it's a strong dollar. Oh that's great except we lose all our business. It's great for me. I can buy property all over Europe I can buy it so cheap I bought done back in Ireland. I. Scott I'm all over the place. I bought the great Turnberry. They're having the Women's British Open at my place Turnberry one of the great resorts of the world what are the great golf courses of the world.
I bought it. I bought it. And you know what. Here's the problem. Next week we have the women's British Open one of the greatest majors in the world. I don't even know if I'm gonna be there. Do you think I'm going to be allowed to take two days off and just go for two days and see should I or not. Or should I say.
No. I know my people say oh can you stay here and make more speeches. I said Can I just go see for two days two or four days. I mean you know. So anyway but it's a Turnberry. But you know you can buy over there because the dollar and what's happening with all of the other currencies. And let me tell you.
I mean there are certain good things about a strong dollar. But mostly it's going to suck us dry. It's gonna be a real problem and you can see it. And I know you people are saying it you're seeing it big league in this world in this business. So we go and we have people and we can make our country so strong through negotiation and you know the Chinese have a lot of respect for me. Made a lot of money on a big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco.
Nobody knows and nobody knows what I young you know I have these guys maybe is not worth 10 billion I think he's only worth seven. Actually worth more than ten. But you know that's. Remember they said he'll never file. They said he'll never run. These guys they're arrogant you know they call him The Walking heads.
You know the political pundits they're arrogant people the terrible and you know the ones that hit me the hardest are the conservative ones the liberals like me better than the craziest thing and I have nothing liberal going about me. I think they like my style better. You know it's funny but the walking hits so they say he'll never run ever ever.
You know with such confidence then I announce I'm running. They say oh well he'll never say I'll sign his paper. You know it's a single page which sort of says you know you're putting up your life expecting to sign they'll never sign his FEC paper. I signed the paper. So. They say. Well putting yourself on the line.
Applause. I feel guilty with these folks. How's my hair look back. You know it is. It is my hair. I take more up use I had a story recently was so good they say is a financial genius everybody said they. He was the worst hairpiece I've ever seen. I'm saying I can't even give the sort anybody and it's not true anyway.
So they said he'll never ever in a million years signed his papers and then they say oh he'll never put in his financials so I have these counts are paying a lot of money. I have these counties all over the place because I think it's 98 pages of sums. Largest one of a found the largest numbers ever filed and I put that in. They don't know what to say.
They don't know what to do. They have no idea what to do. And they thought I wouldn't file because they said well he's probably not as rich as people think. But then it turned out I was much richer. Now they don't know what they really screwed up much Richard fact. I'm so proud. I'm unlike Mitt Romney. You know he ran from it and his numbers were peanuts in all fairness.
But but I was very disappointed because he joked I mean he I don't know something happened to him that last month month and a half. I don't want his endorsement. Believe me I will get it. But but he choked that last month and a half he was a disaster. I said to Mitt why aren't you on television. Obama say what you want about Obama.
He was on Jay Leno. He was on David Letterman was all over the place. I said Where are you. And he wasn't there. So he choked you know like. An athlete. Sometimes they choke and that's bad. But I put the numbers in I put the papers in and then I go. And now people think I'm hurt because you know nobody thought I was running.
Because they listen to these people. So now people say he's running and then the polls start coming out because you know when I'm not running it's different. Let me ask you question to you because you look so friendly stand up fo r a second before you with the glasses handsome guy stand up. When. Before you thought I was running you wouldn't give me a poll because you say hey Trump's great I love Trump at all that somebody's not going to run I'm not going away.
Right. But after I run it's a different story. Now you like Trump is that right. You better believe it's I pick the right guy. Thank you. Thank you. See that's a very dangerous thing to do because it could be. He's not a jump fan and then the whole day is over. Right. Thank you. That was great. So. The polls now coming out kind of just killing everybody.
I'm even like surprised and a lot of people are surprised and the biggest people are calling me saying this is a movement as we said and it's just a great feeling and the feeling is. And then they say oh here's the new one. Well he's having a good time. He's having a good time. If you think this I mean I love you people I love Iowa but it's hot as hell in this room I'm sweating like a dog.
Applause and I could be doing something else right now. I mean honestly he's having a good time. He'll eventually leave the race. Why. I've already had Macy's which is a terrible company with chicken. I'm just a chicken company guy was a good friend of mine and he let me down. And you know why he let me down because I want to stop illegal immigration.
So they got angry and it was peanuts anyway. It wasn't a big deal. But I just hate to say. And by the way so many people are boycotting Macy's. It's I love it. I love it. I love it because that's what's wrong with our country. People are afraid to do the right thing. They're afraid. Then I heard I was losing NASCAR headlines all over the world.
And I friend a friend called me from Paris France. Oh Don it's too bad about NASCAR. You know they have these headlines Trump and NASCAR to sever their over want illegal immigration sever relationships. He said How big a deal was it. I said they rented my ballroom for an evening. That was the deal they read.
And I'm going to rent it to somebody else hopefully for more and keep their deposit. That's what they be. That was the. Then the next day headlines all over the world. You saw it. ESPN does sever ties with Trump. I get calls from my friends Oh my. Donald so bad you're taking such a beating you're taking such a terrible beating.
And you know what that was that was a golf outing in Los Angeles on a wonderful course along the ocean. That's fantastic. So now they're going to a third rate course and they're not very happy. And by the way they all say don't worry Donald will be back next year. That's that's the way life works. So I'll just tell you I'm on the plane and I see this vicious twinkle I've been nice to Scott Walker and you know he's a nice guy.
He came up to my office like three 4 months ago presented me with a plaque because I helped him with his election. I like that he was fighting. You know at least I didn't know what the hell he was doing. But he was fighting and I like a fighter. Does that make sense. So. I've been very nice to him. But he brings me this beautiful plaque.
I don't know who pays for it does he pay for that or does Wisconsin pay for it. I don't know but it's beautiful. And I'm being very nice to him. And then today I read this horrible. Statement from his fundraiser about Trump I said Oh finally I can attack. Finally finally I would have never done this. I didn't know because I hear I'm the only one beating me in Iowa is Scott Walker not by that much.
And he grew up you know he grew up next door. I mean he's like great. Next a little advantage right. Except Wisconsin's doing terribly. It's first of all it's in turmoil. The roads are a disaster because they don't have any money to rebuild them. They're borrowing money like crazy. They projected a one billion dollar surplus and instead of a one build I wrote this stuff all down.
Although I need because I've a really good memory but they projected a 1 billion dollar surplus and it turns out to be a deficit of two point two billion dollars. And money all over the place. It's the schools are a disaster and they're fighting like crazy because there's no money for the schools the hospitals and education is a disaster.
And he was totally in favor of Common Core. Did you know that he was totally in favor of it which I hate. I heard you got to educate your children from Iowa not some bureaucrat in Washington making one hundred thousand I mean you gotta do something that to me I don't get. I mean Bush is totally in favor of Common Core now with Bush.
I'll give him one thing. He stuck with it. No way I'd rather have it stick with it because he stuck where he's still at it. Scott Walker changed what he saw he was getting creamed. So he changed so now he's not here but he was strongly in favor of Common Core and their interests they borrowed so much money that a big portion of their budget now is paying for it. So what he's doing is kicking it down the road and he's the only guy that's ahead of me and I can't believe I'm in second place I finally am in second place to Iowa but he is next to it but folks you please put me in first place so I feel better.
APPLAUSE So we had the illegal immigration. And last week it became heavy heavy heavy with our incompetent leaders in Washington. I hate to use the word leader because they're not leaders are competent politicians in Washington and it really turned into a battle for the veterans because nobody fights harder for the veteran s and me I built with a small group the Vietnam Memorial in Manhattan.
Believe me and I got a lot of credit for it and I put up the money so years ago and I tell this story you know I put up a lot of money and got worked hard with a very good small group of people and we built the Vietnam Memorial because they were never treated properly especially from Vietnam. They would never treated properly and I'm not so innocent or it but I felt this is something I can do. This is my wheelhouse.
This is what I do. I'm good at that. I'm good at money and I'm good at building things right. Does that make sense. I might not be a great soldier. I don't know maybe I would maybe I wouldn't but I'll tell you I am good at this. And we built this gorgeous. And I've done many things like that Wollman Skating Rink in Central Park so many different things but never has any group of people thanked me. So off.
And this was years ago. This was a long time ago but every time I see a vet eat an especially a V ietnam vet they say Mr. Trump thank you for the memorial. Nobody else. Everything else I do people forgotten it's gone it's gone. Short memories. But the Vietnam Memorial is like something I'm very proud of. And it's beautiful right on the East River.
I mean it is really beautiful. Looking at one of my buildings actually but I didn't build it for that right because I didn't even own the building at that time. So that's good. But. I'm very proud of that. But people they just say they love it. They thank me thank me thank me and everyone else forgets. So I've been fighting hard for the vets because the vets are being treated like third class citizens in this country and there are best therapists and when I came here when I came here today they said we have literally seven or eight in one day hundreds.
I don't even know what the number is hundreds many hundreds of letters from Vietnam vets thanking me. Don't can you bring them up just bring them up if you have them. You have them somep lace. Where are they. Oh here they are. Wow. Oh wow. APPLAUSE Look look at this. This is this is from veterans. These each page different letter.
This is one day we have so many and each one. It's amazing. Each one is a separate. Each one of these letters. This is one day. This took place over the last two weeks I've been fighting like hell. And each one of these is a story about what a disaster the Veteran's Administration is. It is the most corrupt group of people in all of Washington.
And the politicians. The politicians in Washington are dishonest and or incompetent. But there is nothing like worse that happens to our vets. And I mean I could show you back as back in the office we actually have now offices in Iowa would have a great group of people great group. Chuck is here someplace and staff and we have great people.
But you know they said that back in the office you can multiply this times ten times ten. This is less than a day. So. And these are letters of horrible stories and horrible complaints. The waiting list as of last Wednesday was longer than a waiting list has ever been in the history of the V.A. the waiting list to see a doctor.
OK. I mean. Who can do b etter than Trump. I fix things. I get things to work. I manage an so we'll wrap it up but I will say this. Look you have to understand we have a country. And my slogan I actually marked it up with copyright it. Can you believe because other people were using my slogan. They see I get by the way I get the biggest crowds I get the biggest standing ovations.
Everybody knows that the press never reports it and the press doesn't understand that there's a room like this in another part of the building where it's packed also with its closed circuit. You people did better with real estate than they did but that's OK because I'm going oh I'm going over to see them right after this to say hello but they're hearing what we're saying.
But the press is very dishonest the political press you know I've dealt with the financial press and you know look maybe it's simple because it's numbers you have that you have it you don't have maybe it's simple but. And by the way a lot of the a lot of the political press is great like 30 35 percent but some is so dishonest you'll have a meeting like this and the same the crowd was minuscule.
Somebody said this the largest crowd they've ever had in Iowa here the whole thing. I mean that's what I've heard. I don't know but they'll say Mr. Trump spoke in front of a crowd you know record crowds. Mr. Trump spoke in front of a crowd. That is so dishonest it's so terrible. And you know one of the things I say is that I have an expression I used a lot in speeches.
The American Dream is dead but I'm gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. OK. I mean I say that. APPLAUSE I say that. APPLAUSE And I say it a lot. The American Dream is dead and I'm gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. So I go home I see my wife and you know all my speeches alive.
It's like the like when CNN LIVE ON FOX It's life. How do you like to do this you're always live on television and if you make one little mistake they'll say oh it's terrible. I'm on life everyone else. They don't even have cameras you know the other candidates they come there's no cameras with me all my life.
My wife called up. Darling you live all over the world. I say Oh that's great. That makes me feel great. But you know what. I could do without it. I could do without it. So I say that the American dream is dead going to make it bigger. OK. So she said Darling that was terrible what you said today what you said the American dream is dead.
I said no no but I'm going to make it. No no you didn't say that. You should have said that. Since should turn it on. You know the TiVo stuff right. I say turn it on. Let me see. And it has to be the American dream is dead click. And next subject and I go Whoa. Whoa that's bad right. No I go to like man.
That's terrible. She was upset with me. She said Why didn't you say it properly. I said I did. So they have the America because you know how bad a statement that is. So the people in the room loved it but the people in the television didn't get to hear but make America great again. So I actually copyright it because I'm using that a lot and I think it's a great statement.
I think it's a great statement. And all of the candidates have you know different statements. You know one of them has I think rise. I'm saying excuse me. Whose is that. Who's his rise. They have rise. Who's that. Who came up with the rise. That's not good. Probably paid a million dollars to some guy you know to come up with that one.
No but I love to copyright it. So I actually won the copyright I got a cup. I didn't even know I could do that. Good lawyers. I have very good I'm very good with contracts don't you want that. Or do you want. You know a woman got up because I actually think I'm a nice guy I love people I have lots of fun in life.
I've been great at what I do I've had big success I went to the best school I was a good student I got out I built a fortune I had a book The Art of the deal which everybody read probably right. Oh it's right there. Look at them. So so but it was a you know I guess the number one selling business book of all time.
I do the show called The Apprentice. It becomes a big hit. Let's see how well it does without Trump. You know I told NBC I'm not doing it. They were angry at me. They came to my office. They had people from NBC and Comcast just before I announced they came to my office to see if I would not announce would I do the apprentice.
And you know it's big it's a lot of money. Hey did you see. I put down two hundred and thirteen million dollars. That's what I made from the Apprentice. And you had some clowns on top. There's no way. And then I said I'll tell you what I'll bet a year's salary your salary not my salad because they made a mistake.
I would. If you're right I'll pay you for yourself if you're wrong. We'll split it. You'll do it the other way right. So then I found out I was right. All right. Two hundred. So when I won I do you know when I say I'm not doing it. Ma rk Burnett called me good guy. He did the apprentice survivor you know.
He said Donald you're turning down an extension nobody to let me tell you what I'm giving up not only there. But what I'm giving up in deals that I'm not done. It's here somebody said well how much will that campaign cost that's peanuts compared to what I'm giving up. That's peanuts. The campaign is my my smallest cause I'm doing it to make America great again.
That's all. So what happened is a number of people started using that phrase and we actually can you believe this. I sent them legal as you know they were saying and will but they don't say it like I do. They will make America great again. Everyone says just another politician is not going to happen. We will make deals that are so good with foreign countries.
Remember this we're being drained. We're being fleeced. We're being fleeced. The Iran deal. Twenty four days to go and think of that. You know it's funny. I love the idea of a nuclear deal but we got to do it from strength. We should have put the sanctions on double and triple and made the real deal not and not have a guy like Barak as not had a guy like Tony I mean I watched him on television the other day I said Is he right.
Is he right. He's trying to justify 24 days. So first before you get to the 24 days it's a long process OK. You say we're going to do. They're going to fight you. That is probably take who knows how long it took. Then when the when it starts 20 by that time they can move all they can move whatever they want.
They'll go Oh there are no missiles here. You know six months. Oh no this is lovely. Oh. They're so honorable. You know the Iranians is a great people and they are smart. They're great negotiators you know the Persians are great negotiators but there are two things we could talk about the accelerators we could talk about the feel we can talk about a lot that a lot of it you know I had an uncle who is great up at M.I.T. Dr. John Trump really smart guy.
He said well you can do with this stuff. So they have all this period of time all this period of time. But there are two things that you can not ever justify. One is 24 days. And remember this is much longer because before that time limits such a whole process. So one is twenty four days can't be sold. Nobody can sell it. Why isn't it like immediate.
You know they say anywhere any place etc. anytime. But why isn't it immediate. Why is it the media so you can't. So I'll tell you what the other thing you can't sell hostages. We'll get four people over of them and I guess you could say the third thing is a hundred and fifty billion dollars that we give them.
So they are going to be I mean if they were a stock I would buy so much of Iran right now. I would do you know how good I did with picking stocks. You see that all those stocks went up I think 48 out of 50 is very good even though it's not even my business. I don't do stocks for the most part but I just looked and I said you know what it's like let's do some of this.
And I was proud to do it in fact I sold them because I wanted people to see and they saw I had a great record. What was it like forty seven out of 52 or 51 went up. Well if I were a stock picker if I were a country picker you got to pick Iran because what we have done is we have made them a tremendous power an extraordinarily rich country think of it. We're giving them one hundred and fifty billion and much more.
They're going to end up with nuclear. You're going to start. A nuclear revolution. People are going to you wait till you see what happens now with other countries. Israel is devastated as they should be. Israel has been hurt. I mean I don't get it. I have friends of mine that are Jewish that contribute to Obama and I say and smart people.
I say What are you doing. What are you doing. It doesn't make sense. I don't understand it but Israel is going to be. I mean this is a real problem for Israel and it's a real problem for us. And then you see today I don't know. Did you see that the picture of Obama with a gun to his head was a caricature of Obama.
Where the supreme leader. I see on NBC the other day they said the supreme leader not my supreme leader don't call him the supreme leader. It's a great term. That's like a term that Trump would use supreme leader. That's right. He like my supreme leader. So don't use that term say the leader of Iran. Don't say the supreme they say the supreme leader.
And he said today or yesterday big big thing in the papers it says Don't mess with us don't mess with us. And you know the chief negotiator who I watched on television and as soon as I saw him I sai d this guy Kerry cannot deal with him cannot deal with him. It's a different level it's like the New England Patriots playing my high school football team.
That's what it's like. That's what it's like. And you can't deal with them and you have to see you. I mean it's so devastating to see what happened. But the three things the money. OK. And then the other two things. Twenty four days. And why don't we get. So they said about the president's. This I mean. They said we didn't want to talk about the prisoners because it would complicate the negotiations.
Think of this. You know what it is we will feathers we want our prisoners back before we start give them back to give it. If you have the right messenger there are people in this room could do a good. There are people who I would do a great walk in fellas before we start this should have been done before we start not at the end.
We should have it done before this should have been done. I mean I call it the world's longest negotiation . OK just one no forever and we just kept giving up giving up giving up would say we'd like this. No. Oh how about this. No. We have nothing. But if you went in right at the beginning so here's the story.
First of all you should have increased the sanctions have done or would have been very easy actually. That would have been almost as easy as it may be easier. But. But you say right at the beginning fellas no women in the room Sadly they haven't figured that one out that the women are smarter than the men but that's OK they'll figure it out.
In about one hundred and fifty years they'll figure it out. You say fellas you don't want him. You don't need him. We need him up here. It'll be good for the deal. Let the prisoners out right now. Please let him out. Come on. Don't do it. We don't even ask. And then I see Kerry and Obama on television the other day saying it was too complicated too complicated.
And yet according to certain papers a couple of years ago we gave them a nuclear sci entist. Does anyone even know that we gave them a nuclear scientist right. It's hard to believe how incompetent our country is run. So as so it's an honor to be with you and I will tell you if I'm elected president we will.
And very quickly make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much. Wow, what a crowd. Look at that! Thank you. Thank you. Well before we begin, I have to tell you that runway is like an ice skating rink and the first step, I said, "You know this sucker is slippery." I think it was put in by the Democrats or will they let us slide.
I don't know whoever the hell got that thing that's not -- that's a trap, I'm telling you it's like -- it's like ridiculous. You know what I'm saying, "Therefore, don't pay the bill." OK. Because that is crazy, fellas. So next time, you know, we don't want to have that. Can you imagine if I went down, the press would have a field day for weeks and weeks.
They'd say, "He went down. He finally -- He made a mistake." Look at that. Isn't that terrible? Isn't that terrible? Well, I just want to say, hello, Panama City Beach. It's a nice place. We had some -- We had some great times here. You remember before that -- that great election, great, great election. Sixteen, right?
Sixteen. And now we have 20 coming up, who would believe November 3rd, not November 8th, it's November 3rd, and it's going to be just as special as November 8th. Going to be just as special. And in certain ways I can't say it's more important, but it's equally as important, because we've made strides like no country has made strides, what's happened to our country.
But we had a great time and we had some incredible rallies right here and we're working really hard for you and we're going to talk about that in a little while, things are going well, OK, well. You got hit with a little hurricane called Michael. That was not a nice hurricane, I can tell you that, but it's going well and I'm thrilled to be here with really truly incredible men and women of the Florida Panhandle.
My friends, your strength and devotion and values are what truly make America great and what make America run. You know that. You love our country, you're proud of our history and you always respect our great American flag, right. So I was last here in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Michael, you remember?
We came, it was pretty bad stuff and I pledge to you unwavering support and the support of our nation until you have fully recovered and rebuilt and we will never ever leave your side. We've already given you billions of dollars and there's a lot more coming as you do it, and to support your recovery from Hurricanes Michael and Irma.
The federal government has committed more than $10 billion to the state of Florida. That's committed, it's all committed. And Rick Scott and your new Governor is a great Governor. Rick was great. Ron DeSantis is great. So now, Rick has gone on to the Senate, along with Marco Rubio and they're all working we're all working together and things are going good for you and for our country.
Thank you. I love you too. Thank you. That's the guy, but I love him, all right. Wherever the hell you are, I love you. And tonight I'm pleased to announce that my administration will be allocating $448 million in HUD disaster recovery funds for the great people of Florida. These dollars will help communities get back on their feet.
We've already given you many, many millions of dollars, but these are additional monies that are coming in to help the families put their lives together. Some families are still working very hard. It's been a tough one. More money is needed. I've just come from a stop at Tyndall Air Force Base, where I saw the devastating effects of that Category 5 hurricane, Category 5. Never heard about Category 5s before, a Category 5 is big stuff.
Tyndall was scheduled, as you know, by the military to close, you know that, right? You know that? And I got a call from your great representatives and they said, "President, they want to close Tyndall because it got beat up badly." It got beat. In fact we have our best planes there, the F-22 is incredible, incredible fighter jet, the most beautiful plane, I think, I've ever seen and some of them were damaged, but we lost none, we lost none, seven were very badly damaged, they lost none.
And the military had it scheduled to be closed and I heard about it and I made a couple of calls and I said, "General, why are we doing that?" Those people are incredible. Those people they work, they're just outstanding. I said "General, why we're doing it?" And they said, "You know, it was damaged." I said, "So what do we gonna do? Build a new -- a new one someplace else at a bad location?" I said, "We have thousands of people we're going to end up having 8,000 people back there working so we're rebuilding the whole place, and we're doing a job, and we're actually moving in the F-35 fighter jet, which is the newest and the best in the world, and we get a lot of them, we've got a lot of them, and they're going to be moving in, so we're going to have actually many more people working at Tyndall than you had the day before the hurricane.
OK? So be prepared. And they're doing drawings and they're doing architecture of different areas, we're building some new buildings, we're fixing some old good ones that got very badly hurt, but structurally this out and when we're finished, it's going to be something that's really special, one of the best anywhere in the country, OK? And you have something very special, I was with Colonel Laidlaw, who runs it. You know him?
Oh, good, he's a good man. And he was telling me the reasons, and he said we fly right over the ocean. We get up, we fly right out over the ocean. "When you do that, sir, you can do a lot more than when you're flying over people's houses. We know that feeling too." So it's great and it's going to be fantastic in the wake of the terrible storm.
This extraordinary community pulled together and showed the world your unbreakable spirit down here a lot. I knew that long before the storms, by the way, and you've also seen countless volunteers and visitors, students, and faith groups coming here to lend a hand to help like almost no place else you can imagine.
And of course people are still traveling from around the world to enjoy your sun, I happen to be one of them, by the way, and your sand and your pristine waters, which is exactly what you have because Panama City Beach, is open for business, as beautiful as ever. And today, I'm doing the most allowed by law to support the people of Florida because of the severity of this storm, Category 5, we will have the federal government pay for 90% of the cost in many circumstances, 90%. And we can do that because of the incredible devastation and the size of that storm.
So now we need Democrats in Congress to work with us to pass an acceptable bill. We're getting close, it's pretty tough dealing with it. They don't want to build a wall, but we're building the wall. They don't want to do a lot of other things. They don't want to do a lot of things so we're building a lot of things.
We're doing a lot of things that includes additional Hurricane Michael relief funding immediately. The money is coming immediately. No games, no gimmicks, no delays, we're just doing it, we're just doing it. And by the way FEMA. My people at FEMA. FEMA did a tremendous job here and elsewhere, by the way.
They had this, they had Texas. They had Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico got $91 billion, and I understand they don't like me. It's the most money we've ever given to any -- anybody. We've never given 91 billion to a state, we've never given -- we gave to Puerto Rico 91 billion and I'll tell you, the services, you look at the Marines, you look at the Navy, the job they did there was really incredible, incredible, incredible.
In fact, I brought a chart. Would you like to see a chart? Very haphazardly I just happened to have it with me, so there's your chart, has everyone seen that? So now -- I don't want to spend it a big board because that costs the government too much money, I want to say, but you can all see that. That's Puerto Rico, they don't like me. Texas, Florida, the biggest hurricanes we've ever seen, Texas, Florida, but this -- and what the Democrats want to do, they want to give more and more, and I say, "You know what, I have a great relationship with the people of Puerto Rico, but it hasn't been fair the way they've treated all of us from the standpoint of their leaders because they complain they want more money.
You got 91 billion, it's the largest amount of money ever given for a hurricane to a state, to any element, and that's the way it is, but you're getting your money one way or the other and we're not going to let anybody hold it up. And I think that the people of Puerto Rico are very grateful to Donald Trump for what we've done for them.
That was a bad -- that was a bad storm. And you know with with Florida -- Thank you. With Florida, you drive on. Have you -- you drive on. With Puerto Rico it's a little tougher. It's called -- it's called -- yeah, it's called you get into a boat or you get into something, but they did a hell of a job, including bringing the biggest hospital ship in the world right off the island.
So I want to thank the military. I want to thank FEMA for what they did there, for what they did in Florida, Texas. You look at Louisiana, look at South Carolina, they got hit hard. North Carolina got a piece of it. Georgia, Alabama, these are great places and they're all getting aid, but the Democrats are trying to stop it but you're getting it. Don't worry, you're getting get it. You're getting it. And you've already gotten a lot of it, so that's... Instead of wasting time, energy, taxpayer dollars on partisan stunts and hoaxes and witch hunts, Democrats should be focused on building up our country.
Did you see what just happened, by the way? No collusion, no obstruction, no anything. Two years on a witch hunt. I got a gotten anybody in this audience I could have found something on you. Two years, almost $40 million, 20 Trump haters, Democrats, I call them "Angry Democrats". After two years, nothing, no collusion, and now the Democrats, we have a great attorney general.
Now the Democrats are saying, "We want more." You know it was gonna be like, "We want the Mueller report." Now they say, "Mueller report? No. We want to do start all over again." It is a disgrace. We got to focus on infrastructure. We have to focus on lowering medical prices and medicine. Always focused on our military and our vets, which we've done, and the Democrats really should be focused now on restoring and helping the Emerald Coast to Florida, because that's what it is. It's time to come together for the people of Panama City, for the people of Florida, for the people of our country.
It's time to stop this nonsense. They think they're going to win and if you see the one man he said, "It's the only way we're going to beat him in 2020. We have to do this." The only way they -- Well, that's a compliment, I guess, but think of what he said, it's the only way they're going to beat me, and actually it's working the other way because now we have our best poll numbers that we've ever had, it's crazy, it's crazy.
So we want to work with them and we want to do infrastructure. We want to do all of the things that you know about and we're going to get it done. Nobody's done so much as all of us, because it's not just me, I'm a messenger. I've done a good job as a messenger. I've done a good job, but you've done a great job because you came from all over.
You came from all over, you voted, they didn't know you, they didn't know you folks existed in many cases, the invisible people. And you know what you are? You're the smartest, you're the hardest working, you're paying your taxes. You do all of this stuff, great jobs, great talents, you're the best looking people, that's for sure.
You ever see I joke about this, but it's really not joking. They call themselves the elite. You ever see the elite? This is the elite. They're not elite, you're elite. I always take heat. I say you have better houses, so do I. You have better boats. You have better everything. You have better everything, you're smarter, you know, I say, "No ,we're the elite." So let's let them be the elite, but with the super elite, there's not even a contest.
There's not even a contest. I always laugh when I hear "The Elite" and then you see this guy and you say, "He's not elite." Not in my book, he's not. But we're delighted to be joined tonight by many terrific Florida Republican leaders. They really have been fantastic and I you just got a little sample of it and you're getting a great sample of it, because as your Governor, Ron DeSantis, has been doing a fantastic job.
Where is Ron? Where is he? Thank you, Ron, great job, great Governor. And along with Ron, you know, his first lady Casey DeSantis. And your first lady, Melania, is a big fan of Casey, big fan. And a man and a Senator who is working with me very hard on Venezuela and Cuba and lots of other things and he's become really a good friend.
We had our little squabbles, minor squabbles, but we've come together, he's a terrific person actually, Senator Marco Rubio. Where is he? Thank you, Marco. Great job. Good man. How are we doing in Cuba, Marco? How are we doing in Venezuela, step by step? Step by step. What's happening in Venezuela is disgraceful.
People are dying, they have no food, they have no water. This was one of the wealthiest countries, really, in the world and now they're living so badly, so dangerously. So many people are dying and we're working hard on that problem and we're being tough. We're being -- we're being tough, but we have no choice.
It's not fair what's happening to those people, great people The Venezuelan people, I know them very well. Those people around Doral, they're all -- Venezuela's got little Venezuela. I got to know them very well. They're great people, they're great people. Another friend of mine, he was just up and he was a solid, solid person for the people of Florida when he was Governor, he loves the people of Florida.
Now he's in Washington. Senator Rick Scott doing a fantastic -- doing a fantastic job. We have a lot of members of Congress, Matt Gaetz, Neal Dunn. Thank you. Thank you, fellas. You have your Florida Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nez. Jeanette. Thank you, Jeanette, great job. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody.
Thanks, Ash. And by the way, I just met your great U.S attorney. Where is he? Where is he? Thank you very much. You are doing a fantastic job. You are doing a fantastic job. Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis. Jimmy, thank you. Thank you, Jimmy. Florida GOP chair and State senator, Joe Gruber's. Joe. Thanks, Joe.
RNC chairwoman, you know who is she. Won the state, the great state Michigan. I said, "Who was that?" Now nobody's won Michigan for decades as a Republican and we won so when it came to choosing who the head of the RNC would be. I said, "Who is that woman that was so great up in the state of Michigan? Because we won that state we weren't expected to, but you know we left.
That was the last speech I made and we have 32,000 people show up at 1 o'clock in the morning, which is now Election Day. Think of that. And I left -- think of it, Election Day, and I left, and I said, "You know, I don't know why we're going to lose." We had 32,000, our opponent -- we want to be nice, our opponent was there at primetime, like 6 o'clock, and she had 500 people.
I said, "Why are we going to lose Michigan? And you know, what we didn't, because Ronna McDaniel was fantastic. And another one who's fantastic, RNC Co-Chairman Tommy Hicks. Thank you, Tommy. Thank you. Thank you, Tommy. Great job. And we have so many people, like we have so many. We could go on on that, but let's get back to business, right?
So this is an incredible time for our country. America is thriving again, America is winning again and America is being respected again, where respected. In fact, one of the Democrats today said that he, it's a he, sleepy person, said that he heard from a lot of foreign leaders and they want him to be President.
Of course they do, so they can continue to rip off the United States. Of course they do, of course. I think if I heard that I'd never vote for him. And then you have Bernie. Bernie. And then you have Bernie. He gets some real beauties, Crazy Bernie. He had a choice between Sleepy Joe and Crazy Bernie, and I'll take any, let's just pick somebody please and let's start this thing.
Let's start it. Pick somebody. There were a young man, boot edge edge. Edge, edge. They say edge, edge. He's got a great chance, says he'll be great, he'll be great. Representing us against President Xi of China, that'll be great, that'd be great. I want to be in that room. I want to watch that one. By the way, you see the tariffs were down because they broke the deal.
They broke the deal. They broke the deal. So they're flying in the vice premier. Tomorrow he's flying. A good man, but they broke the deal. They can't do that so they'll be paying, if we don't make the deal nothing wrong with taking in over $100 billion a year, hundred billion. We never did that before and we have that happening.
A lot of good things happening with a lot of countries. We have a deal with Mexico. We have a deal with kind of -- worst deal NAFTA. How bad was NAFTA? All the empty buildings, all the empty plants. We have a great deal with Mexico and Canada. We've got to get the Dems in the House to approve it and if they don't that'll be OK too, we're going to do something else, we'll be just as good if not better, you always have alternatives, folks.
Gotta have alternatives. When they want to hold you up, which is a hold up, when they want to hold you up for political reasons. You always have to have alternatives, that a lot of good alternatives, sometimes better, some of it's better. Our economy is now the hottest anywhere on earth and it's the envy of the world.
Every time a foreign leader, a President, a prime Minister, a king, a queen, a dictator, we got some of them too, every time they come into the office they say, "Congratulations on what you've done for this economy. It's the hottest on Earth, it's incredible.", every single time. That's how they started off the conversation, and you know it because the people of Florida are truly benefiting by what we've done internationally and nationally, so thank you.
And our policy can be summed up in three very simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs. The United States economy created another 260,000 jobs last month. Way, way, way above what people thought. They were making predictions much lower than the big one. They were thinking about. 1%, 1.2%, maybe 1.5, and our growth number came in for the first quarter, which is almost always the lowest quarter of the year.
Historically, 3.2%, crushing expectations, a lot of surprise people, I wasn't surprised. Since the election, we've created nearly 6 million new jobs, including more than half a million manufacturing jobs and nearly 700,000 new construction jobs. Numbers that, if I would have said this during the campaign, those people back there, I call them the fakers, fake news media, the fakers would have said, "He exaggerated.
He exaggerate." They are a bunch of fakers, there's no question about it, but you know in six years they're all going to be out of business, folks. They're all going to be out of business. Now if we want to drive them crazy, I'll, say in 10 years they'll go crazy. See he is a despot. He is a despot. Well, 10 or 14, let's see whatever we like, right?
Watch, it will be headlines tomorrow. Donald Trump wants to break constitution. Unemployment just reached the lowest rate in more than 50 years. The women's unemployment rate is the lowest in more than 65 years and soon will be a record number. Women, women, remember last election, "Oh, he's going to do so bad with women." I did great with women.
We did great with women. Hispanic-American unemployment just hit another brand new all-time historic low. African-American unemployment recently achieved the lowest rate in the history of our country, and likewise Hispanic-American unemployment lowest in the history of our country. I'm going to like that on the debate stage, you'll be hearing me laughter, I'll say, "The lowest rates ever in history, highest income ever in history for the different groups, highest income." More people are working today in the United States almost 160 million than have ever worked In the United States before.
Nearly 1 million more African-Americans are employed today than when they took office. Think of that, think of that. That's what it is. This guy just screamed out 14 more years now. Fourteen more years after many years of stagnation wages are rising very fast, hasn't happened in 20 years, and they're rising fastest, which makes me feel very good for blue-collar workers, fastest proportionately.
And driving our whole agenda is a jobs boom that is historic. Hasn't happened like this in many, many years, if at all. Certainly, during record keeping has not happened like this, and it has a lot to do with the fact that we've cut more federal regulations and regulations than any President in the history of our country.
So these great companies now can breathe and hire people, right? OK. And we just passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history, the largest. And we got rid of the individual mandate of Obamacare, the most unpopular. And by the way, we would have repealed and replace Obamacare, but one vote didn't work out after campaigning for eight years, this particular person decided at the last moment to go no, it's all right, we'll get it anyway, doesn't matter.
This will end up getting better, we'll end up doing better. Sometimes you know things like that happen and you get angry and you get a little bit sad, and then some of you weep, I don't weep but you don't weep too much. I know too many of you. They never weeped in their life. They didn't weep when they were babies.
But you get a little bit angry about it and you know what you do, you go and you fight and it ends up being better than what you were trying to do in the first place, that happens, that happens. And a good one for those of you that love your children, of which I would think, probably it's 95%. To keep your family farms and ranches and small businesses in the family, they don't talk about this.
We eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax. So now if you love your child or you love your children and you have a beautiful farm, ranch, small business, it's doing great. You know the old days meeting like about two years ago, they had to go out, borrow money from a bank, lose their business in many cases.
Now you don't have a tax, you don't have a tax. So if you love them, good. If you don't love them, I would leave it to them, and it's not going to matter. It won't help you much. But if you love your family, that's what's going to happen. It's a great thing. We're reducing burdens in our businesses, but in return we expect American companies to invest in America, which is what we're demanding to raise wages in America, which is happening and to hire American workers to do the job.
That's what we want. And as I stand here floating around on a piece of ice, this is crazy. I'm a little bit concerned about leaving the podium, I'm holding. You have no idea what I'm going through on this stage. It's the worst damn stage I've never seen. I've never seen -- Stupid people did this one. I don't know, or brilliant, or brilliant, it may be enemy.
If it is the enemy, then they're brilliant, but I want him the hell out of here. And we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that enrich Wall Street at the expense of Main Street. You see what's happening, although everyone is doing well right now, everybody, the companies are doing great when Wall Street does good, that's a good thing for us. A lot of you have 401(k)s, where they're doubled what you had just a couple of years ago, right?
I tell the story happens a lot, but for some reason this big policeman, you might have heard it, but this big, strong guy comes to me, I was in New York, and he said, "Sir, thank you. My 401(k)...", and that was a year ago. This happens all the time. He said his 401(k)s up 47%. He said, "My wife used to think I was just horrible at investing and now she thinks I'm the greatest investor in the world, and I thank you." Now the numbers are much better since then, but that's the 401(k)s, everybody's through the roof and we're on the way to keep it that way.
We're going to make it better and stronger and we're going to take in a lot of money from a lot of these countries and other folks that have been ripping us off for a long time. Long time. I mean, we pay for the military or we're defending nations that are so rich. And I say to him, "King, you've got to do me a favor.
You got to pay." "But nobody has ever asked for money." I said, "No, no. You got to pay. You've got to pay." We'll lose billions and billions of those individual countries, and you know it's one thing, if we're helping people who are being horribly treated and they don't have money, and the countries are -- it's one thing.
It's another thing if we're dealing with countries that are loaded with cash, make a fortune, and we're defending them for a tiny fraction of what it costs. It's ridiculous. So it's all changing, lots of changes. One country, I won't say the country, but one country we spend a lot of money on defending. Very dangerous territory and it costs us $5 billion, and I said to a general, "Please do me a favor, General.
Tell me how much is it cost for us to defend this country, which is very rich?" Sir, I will check. He comes in, "Sir, it's $5 billion, sir." I said, "That's okay. Now, how much do they pay us? "Sir, they pay us $500 million." I say, "We lose $4.5 million to defend a country that's rich as hell and probably doesn't like us too much." Can you believe that?
And we've been defending it for many years. So I call the leader of the country. I said, "You know it's not fair. We're spending all of this money, great danger, and we have our men and women, they're the best in the world and we're sending them over to your country, not fair. You got to pay, you've got to pay." And he said, like the king, he said, "But nobody's ever asked us that before." I said, "That's because you had stupid people." So they said -- they said -- Thank you.
He said -- I just wonder if I could give you a hundred stories like this. He said that we can't do anything now because it passed our so-called parliament, and so we can't, it doesn't come due. 'When's next year?" He said, "Two months." I said, "All right, pay me something now. How much will you pay?", "We can't pay you more than $500 million." I got to say there's one phone call, right?
They said, "Make it 750." Now that's a long way short of four and a half billion that we're losing, but I should make it 750. Anyway, we agreed to a number around 500 million. It was one phone call that lasted for 10 minutes and once they got over the shock of being -- they have plenty of money. And now the two months is up, and I just told my people call them and ask for the rest of it, OK? But we have many countries like that, I mean, we have many countries like that.
We have countries like Saudi Arabia very rich, nothing but cash, right? So I think they can afford to pay us, right, for defense, and they will, and you know what, they will. And they're buying a tremendous amount of equipment, $450 billion they'll be spending in our country. Four hundred and fifty billion.
But we have a lot of countries that are rich, that we're defending, and they don't even respect it. Honestly, when I ask them, they almost are looking at me saying, "I should have thought, you know, like it's amazing that nobody's asked us that." They don't say that they're smart, but you feel it. So a lot of countries we're defending, it's not fair what's happening, they're paying us a tiny fraction in some cases.
We defend Europe, it's not fair they're not paying what they should be paying. We'll work it out, but they got to pay their bills. And you know what? In the end, they're going to like us more and in the end they're going to respect us ,they're going to respect us. Under the previous administration, the United States lost nearly a quarter of a million manufacturing jobs.
You remember that. They let other countries raid our factories, steal our jobs and rob us blind, other than that they were very nice. They allowed China to freely loot our economy, plunder our intellectual property and target our industries for destruction. That's what was happening and look, President Xi, who's a friend of mine, great guy, but he -- he's for China, I'm for the USA, I'm for the U.S., so we're going to see.
They come in tomorrow, whatever happens, don't worry about it. It'll all work out. You know why, it always does. I'll worry about it. There's no pressure, because you know we're the piggy bank that everybody wants to rob, you understand that. So we have the thing that everybody wants. We're now the biggest market in the world by far.
I'll tell you, China was catching us. If another person happened to be in this position right now, first of all, they'd be about 10 people instead of all the people -- hey, I wish the cameras could spin around and show this massive field. You know, they won't do it, they won't do it, they never do it, they don't like to show it. And you know, I actually try and explain the ones that are semi friendly.
I said, "You know, it's good for your production value to do that." Your production values are much better. Yup, let them know it now. Look at this field. They never show it. They will show the people behind me, congratulate. They may have a lousy seat, but you know what they'll be famous tomorrow. But it is true, they never like to show the crowds.
I went to Texas and I made a speech and Beto, Beto. Why has he fallen like a rock? What the hell happened to Beto? So we went to El Paso and I made a speech and we had an arena that holds 8 or 9,000 people, the arena was packed. We had 35,000 people outside we had these massive movie screens outside, so those people that couldn't get in could see.
He had 502 people. The next day in the news, the New York Times guy, actually wrote a story that he thinks that he had more people than me. Can you believe this? No, no. Can you believe? So dishonest. And most of them just said, "Two massive crowds." Well, his crowd was not massive. He had like 502 people according to the people that count crowds.
So we get a very bum press, but that's OK, because we're here and they're not, right? A very dishonest people and maybe it'll change. You know, what's wrong with having a strong military, good education, a strong economy. I don't get it, I don't get it. I don't get it, the hatred is incredible, but let's just keep it going folks, because that's the way it is. But the great betrayal of the American middle class ended the day that I took the oath of office because I'm with you, I'm with you.
And there Are those who say, even the fake news media, there are those who say it was the greatest day in the political history of this country's, it's the greatest election, and it continues, you know, because they keep trying to take it away. Let's try to take it our way. That's not working too well, that's not working.
But for -- Think of it. I mean, Hillary Clinton is still going up.  "I think they stole the election." I know she lost -- the next time.  No, no, the next time, the next time she's got to go to Wisconsin to campaign. You know it hadn't been lost in decades. The people are great in Wisconsin you have to go there and campaign.
The people said, "Oh, you'll, be OK." The Republicans haven't won the great state of Wisconsin in decades. Got to go there. I went there a lot and in all fairness, her husband Bill, who's a good politician. They didn't listen to him. He said, "You better go to Wisconsin, you better go to Michigan, I'm seeing a lot of things out there.
I see a lot of signs, Trump-Pence. Mike Pence is doing a good job, by the way. Doing a good job. And his wife Karen is doing a great job. Mike. But I see a lot of Trump-Pence signs out there on the lawns. You better go there and they sort of said, "What the hell does he know? Well he's a pro, he's a pro.
He know a lot better than their analysts. Their analysts weren't so good, but you have to go and you have to work and we are officially in a couple of weeks -- we're starting. Can you believe? I got in the White House two and a half years ago and the first night I stood on the area, the beautiful residents, they call it, beautiful.
I said to Melania, "Do you believe this?" It's going to be so long? It seemed like four years would never happen and now we're a year and a half away less think of it. It's incredible how time flies, especially when despite the obstacles and the artificial things they put in your path, especially when you love what you're doing and more importantly, I love the results of what's happening because you hear them, you hear them.
So just an answer will increase tariffs in China and we won't back down until China stops cheating our workers and stealing our jobs, and that's what's going to happen. Otherwise, we don't have to do business with them. We don't have to do business. We can make the product right here if we have to, like we used to. Remember?
Like we used to. The era of economic surrender is over. The last administration also signed a disastrous trade deal with South Korea that cost our country nearly 100,000 jobs but it was really 250,000 jobs. And if you remember, our secretary of state at the time and our President at the time said, "This will give 250,000 jobs, and he and she were right, except it was for South Korea, not for us. It's a loser and we totally renegotiated the Korea trade deal to restore these jobs and rescue the American auto industry, because that was going to be a tremendous help, and that deal is done, South Korea.
And right before I came into office, our nation was being signed up for a one-sided single sell out like you've never seen of the American worker, and I said it's not going to happen. The Trans-Pacific Partnership was going to destroy our automobile industry like you've never seen before, and our automobile industry is pouring back into our country.
And today for the people of the great state of Ohio, remember? You have to win the great state of Ohio. Boy, did we win it? We won it by like nine points, it's a great state. So everyone's coming back in. Toyota's coming in. Honda's coming in. Many, many car companies, General Motors today just announced three big plants, 450 workers, 700 million.
But the big announcement is in Lordstown, Ohio, they're going to be selling that plant to workhorse, it's called -- they make electric trucks because the enemy. With all of the companies pouring into Michigan, all of the companies pouring into Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, everywhere with all of these companies.
They kept telling me with Lordstown, because General Motors closed it while they did the right thing, they sold it to a company. That's going to do a great job with that beautiful plant, and that happened just a little while ago, just a little while ago. They'll be spending a lot of money on fixing it up. It's subject to the UAW.
They've got to get out there make a deal. UAW, come on, got to make a deal. But that's a great thing, right? Because that was the only thing they could hit me with. They couldn't have been happy with anything, because we've been so good, but this is -- what about Lordstown? What about Lordstown? I call up Mary Barra, "Will you make a deal or open it, please.
I'm getting killed with that plant." Anyway, today she called, they're going to be opening, it's going to be a great company going there, it is really wonderful. And another historic action. We finalized an agreement to replace the horrible NAFTA trade deal with the brand new USMCA, like the song MCA. The USMCA will mean countless more jobs for Florida farmers, ranchers, and growers, and manufacturers, but while were unleashing an unprecedented wave of prosperity, the Democrat Party is trying to return us to the failures of yesterday.
They want to have things rejected because they're all waiting for 2020. They think the more they can hurt us the worse they make us look. I think they're making us look better person. I really do, I really do. I mean, they want to do investigations instead of investments. They want to do what they're doing, which looks so foolish, and maybe I read it wrong, but I think it drives us right on to victory in 2020, because people get it, people get it. But our country, the great USA, is not being pushed around anymore.
Nothing is more dangerous than the Democrats crazy immigration agenda. Democrats believe that everyone in the world has the right to violate our borders. They want open borders, disrespect our laws, and come into our country and collect benefits, courtesy of the United States taxpayers. Thank you very much.
Right? So, despite the fact -- and you see the hell we're going through trying to get the wall, which by the way works. They say, "We want to give him drones. We want to give him technology." Without the wall nothing works, folks. You know that. So we're going to have over 400 miles of wall built, it's already -- much of it's already started.
By the end of next year and we'll concluded pretty shortly thereafter. We'll have the whole thing sealed up and it'll be a lot easier. It's very tough when you have the worst laws on immigration, the worst loopholes. Catch and release, you catch somebody and then you have to release them. Oh, that's a wonderful plan.
Chain migration, you come in and you bring your whole damn family, and if you're no good, he had people all over the place. This is chain migration. The other one is Visa Lottery, it's a lottery. Who is coming to the United States. So these countries put people in a basket like little -- Who is it? Who is it? Let's see.
Well, that's beautiful. This isn't like a stone-cold killer. Yes, thank you. Tell me, if the United States is accepting people under a lottery system, compliments of Chuck Schumer. If they're accepting people under a lottery system, do you actually think that the country is giving us their finest? No, no. They are giving us some rough people.
I won't say it. If you remember when I made the speech at the base of Trump Tower. I talked about what's happening. I mentioned the word rape. I was absolutely -- by the fake news media. They went after guess what that speech was so mild compared to what's actually happening, that you read it today and it's like unbelievable.
But Democrats say they care about the poor, but their open border policies drive down wages, drain Social Services, and hurt the poorest Americans more than anybody else, and the crime that comes in is unbelievable. You know read it, they don't want to talk about it. Sanctuary City is a total disaster.
Republicans believe that you, the American citizen, have the absolute right to have your laws and borders enforced and enforced strongly. It's your country. We believe that a welfare program should be protected for truly needy Americans, not for illegal aliens that come into our country alone. We believe that our immigration system should put the jobs and safety of American families first.
We want to help people and we want to be gracious and we want people, we need people frankly, because we have so many companies moving into our country. We're the hottest country they want to move their plants, we need people, they have to come in through merit. Merit. Last month alone, 100,000 illegal aliens were apprehended at our borders.
You know what that is? They catch him, they take their name, they have to bring him to a court, they take him to court then they have to release him because we have tens of thousands of people in detention bays and they can't release him. Now we did win a great court case last night. Go back to Mexico. They're going back to Mexico.
And I told Mexico, very nicely, that you can't let people walk 2,000 miles up your country, because if we do that we're going to close our border, if we have any more, we're going to close the border. I don't care what it'll be. We'll close our border. So Mexico now, for the first time, has been taking people back to Honduras and Guatemala, and El Salvador, and other countries, and for the first time, not big enough numbers but they're getting bigger, they're getting bigger.
We can't have this folks. We can't have this. This is crazy, what's happening. And what we really need, more than anything else, we need the loopholes closed by Congress. It would take 15 minutes. Everybody knows what they are, asylum asylum. They walk in, they read a statement by a lawyer, written by a lawyer at the border, who probably gets paid by somebody that's not exactly friendly to this crowd.
I am very fearful of my life. My country is a very frightening place to be. Please help me. In the meantime, there's tattoos all over his face. And they say, "No, no he's the one that causes the fright." And he comes in and he talks about his country. But then they have a picture of him five days sooner walking up flying the national flag of their country.
So if he's so afraid of his country, why is he flying the flag of the country, right? Flying the flag. They want to fly the flag of Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador right into our border. Save that flag, we love our country, we love our country, but we're afraid of it for purposes of getting into the United States, we're afraid of our country.
Now we can't let this happen. The Democrats, we need the votes we have to -- We need the votes, otherwise you're going to have to vote him out of office, Congress, the Senate you're gonna have to vote him out of office. Come November, next November, November 3rd, next year. You're gonna have to vote him out of office because otherwise you can't make a change.
We need the votes. We have to go through Congress. How we ever ended with this stuff is incredible, but they don't mind it so much because they don't mind crime. They don't mind crime. No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws, and no one should run for office without an iron clad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.
Shouldn't be allowed to run. And to confront this crisis, as you saw that it was a big deal two months ago. I declared a national emergency, which is what it is. This is an invasion. When you see these caravans, starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion. I was badly criticized for using the word invasion, it's an invasion and it's also an invasion of drugs coming in from Mexico, OK. It's an invasion of drugs.
They all better be careful, because you know we're destroying the lives of hundreds of thousands of people a year with the drugs that are pouring across our southern border. They better damn well, be careful, because people are wise to it now. They have drug dens and drug labs and factories right along the border.
They make the crap right there and they send it over our border, where we don't have walls. They drive it right through because we have 2,000 miles between the Gulf and the Pacific. Two thousand miles. Now a lot of it you don't need the wall because it's mountains, it's big, strong rivers, it's snake country, nobody's walking through certain areas.
You got a lake snakes a lot. They got some rough country, but we need and what we need we'll have done. But they can't do this, they can't let this happen, and we've been very tough with them, I'll be honest. Mexico made $100 billion on average over the last 10 years, a hundred billion. They took 30%, almost, of our automobile business.
We made cars, they sent them through the United States that won't happen anymore. Under the USMCA, it'll be prohibited. It it'll be economically prohibited. Our current immigration crisis is the result of Democrat backed policies that prevent border crossers from being swiftly returned home. A border crossing comes in, you say, "Sorry, we're taking you home." And that's if you're nice, and I want to do that.
OK? But we're the only one that has judges, judges, think of it. They come across, we have judges with the honor, and nobody else has judges. We give them a trial, we need Perry Mason, it's crazy. Folks, it's crazy. And then they say, and the wall would help, because that would -- not help, the wall would stop it, OK? The wall would stop it. I mean, when you have 15,000 people marching up and you have hundreds and hundreds of people and you have two or three border security, people that are brave and great, and don't forget, we don't let them and we can't let them use weapons, we can't. Other countries do, we can't. I would never do that.
But how do you stop these people? You can't. There's no -- that's only in the Panhandle you can get away with that said. Only in the Panhandle. So it's a tough situation, but if they change the loopholes, we'll have it perfectly and when the wall is finished, it's going to be great. Democrats even supported deadly sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets, they're protected.
Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. Congress must act to fix our horrible immigration laws. We must end catch and release. Stop human smugglers. Have you seen what's happening? Human smugglers, human traffickers. Have you seen what they're doing?
This is an ancient thing. It's an ancient crime. It's bigger now because of the computer because of the Internet than ever before worldwide, not just here, worldwide and most come through our southern border where we don't have a wall, they don't go through ports of entry. Your people looking inside the car or the van.
So you can't do that. If you have women tied up with tape over their mouths, you can't take them through a port of entry. And a lot of these people say, "Oh they come through the port, they don't come through the port. They come through areas where you don't have the wall. Fifteen miles up and make a left.
We had to shut down sanctuary cities, deport criminal aliens, and replace the visa lotteries to chain migration with a modern system of immigration. We have to do it. On issue after issue the Democrat party is never been further outside the American mainstream. It's never been, I've never heard of anything like what's going on. I want to run so badly.
I want this race to start immediately. Now Democrats are pushing a $100 trillion dollar takeover of the U.S economy, known as the Green New Deal. That was written up by a real genius. The New Democrat Party believes in socialism. Take a look at Venezuela, Republicans believe in freedom. We need to get Senators elected.
We need to get the votes. We need Congressmen and women elected. Republicans. We need to get the votes. You got to get out there, you got to win, otherwise we'll be playing around the clock. And Democrats are aggressively pushing late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth.
And then you have this Governor in Virginia, you saw that. The baby is born and you wrap the baby beautifully and you talk to the mother about the possible execution of the baby. Oh, can't do that. So, who heard of that one? And that came up and that's now something, and they don't even want to discuss it, they don't even want to discuss it. And to protect innocent life, I called on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late-term abortion.
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, witch hunts, and delusions. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans. We want to make America great again. That's what we're doing. I wish the cameras -- Would you please show these people? I go home, you know, you hear it. You hear it. You can hear how many people, but they never show it. They don't want to do it. It's like a Florida or Florida State football game, is it right?
We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream every day, we're making very, very good on our model. In fact, much better than we promised, and you know what it is, it's promises made, promises kept. We've actually given you more promises and a couple of my opponents said this, they weren't happy about it, but we've given you more promises than we said we would do. That's very unusual for a politician.
That may be a first. Earlier this year, I signed an executive order to defend free speech on college campuses. And we are carefully monitoring the actions of social media giants. Big tech must not censor conservative or other voices, and we are also taking steps to address judicial overreach, activist judges whose issue -- That's right.
You know about that, right? We did a big thing. And the Democrats hate that I did this because you know in sight of this, in reverse, was Bill Clinton when he was President because activist judges who issued nationwide injunctions based on their personal beliefs, undermine democracy, and threaten the rule of law.
Take a look at what we did for criminal justice reform. Nobody thought it could be done and we passed it. And it's tough as hell, but it's also fair. It's fair. That's why we're appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, and we just confirmed, listen to this, our one 100th federal judge will soon be in record territory, not to mention two great Supreme Court judges.
We've got two great Supreme Court justices. What a difference and having them up there makes you feel good about your country. Doesn't it makes you feel good about your country? We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, we're doing big. Last year prescription drug prices went down for the first time in nearly 51 years.
Just today, we announced that the drug companies will now be required by law to include prices in television advertisements, first time. It's going to drive the price down. And we're vastly expanding affordable alternatives to Obamacare before we terminate it and replace it with something good once we take over the House, the Senate, the presidency together.
And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. Always. The Republican Party will always protect patients with preexisting condition. People with preexisting conditions. And for the veterans, we passed VA's choice. So right now as they wait in line for two weeks, three weeks, 10 days, four days, two months, people that weren't even very sick or terminally ill, before they get to see a doctor, they immediately go outside, find a good local doctor, get themselves fixed up and we paid the bill, and it's a great thing for our veterans.
They've been trying to get it passed for 44 years. We got it passed. And we also passed -- 46 years they've been trying. VA accountability because under the VA you couldn't fire anybody. If they were terrible to our great vets, they could be sadistic, they could steal, they could rob, they could do anything.
We had no way of firing these people. Now we passed VA accountability. They don't treat our vets right, boom, you're fired. Forty-six years they tried to get that. Little hard. Working, I mean, in that case, was against the unions and against civil service, not too easy. We're, unlocking American energy.
The United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. One. We're slashing permitting delays for vital infrastructure projects. We had highways that would take 21 and 22 years to get approved. We brought it way down, we're trying to make it one year, we're close to getting that we're down to two or three at the most.
This was taking 20 when there was a certain road in a certain state. They were working on it for 21 years. It costs hundreds of times more money. It used to be a straight line. Now it's a line like this. If you had a couple of drinks, you had a very bad shot of making it home. Cost a fortune, 21 years. Now we're trying to get it down to one year and maybe it gets rejected for environmental reasons.
That's OK, but you have people that worked on projects almost for their entire life and then they go to a vote and some council and they lose three to two. Now you may get rejected, but it's going to take a year, year and a half, but mostly you're not going to get rejected. It's going to be done in a really good way, so we're trying to get that permitting process down for roads, for highways, for bridges, for tunnels, for everything.
There's no reason it should be taking 20 years, and as promised we've directed more than a half a billion dollars to fix Lake Okeechobee's, Herbert Hoover Dike. Everybody wanted that done. Your Governor, both your Governors, your last Governor and your current Governor, wanted that done. So we have the Army Corps of Engineers are doing a fantastic job and they're getting it done.
It will now be completed in three years, way ahead of schedule, years and is back. And I was out there eight weeks ago, and it was incredible. And earlier this year I signed legislation providing $100 million to fight the red tide that harms coastal regions, especially In Florida. The red tide doesn't look too inviting I come down to Florida say, "What the hell is that." The red tide, so we're going to get rid of it. And to keep America safe, we're rebuilding America's military might like never before, including $133 million for the Gulf Coast test range.
You know that is Gulf. Anybody there? Anybody like practice shooting? Trust me it's a good thing for you, folks, you don't have to shoot. It's a good thing, 133 million. The military needs it so badly and it's going to be very quickly completed and many other enhancements in the great state of Florida to help our wonderful warriors, Who are doing such an incredible job as an example at Eglin Air Force Base, Eglin.
Eglin. Great, great people. Now we've made a decisive break from the failed foreign policy establishment that sacrificed our sovereignty, surrendered our jobs and tied us down to endless foreign wars. I don't know if you saw, but about eight weeks ago we took 100% of the caliphate. It was supposed to take two years in Syria, ISIS.
That doesn't mean that they're not going to go around. These people are stone-cold crazy. And it doesn't mean they don't go around blowing up a store and blowing up some. They are just nuts, but we took 100%, and when I took over this helm, this great country, we were way behind, you had to see. I showed the map, it was all so much ISIS, and within a short period of time we wiped it out, the caliphate.
We have 100%, but still still it's a mental condition. These people are sick, they're crazy, they're crazy, so always keep your eyes open, be careful, and let law enforcement know when you see a kook, let them know because we have the greatest law enforcement on Earth. Let them know. In everything we do, we are now putting America first for years.
We lost in so many different ways we were losing on trade. We were getting beaten by people in countries that had no chance. We were insisting that no NATO members -- you had to see this, the NATO folks they don't pay their fair share. They were supposed to pay. We were taking over and spending almost 100% of our money to protect the countries in NATO, which is Europe, and I said, that's not right.
On top of that, the EU absolutely kills us. So it's all changing, folks. One hundred billion dollars extra was just given by those countries that's now pouring into NATO because they said you got to pay up. your past Presidents would go and meet them and wouldn't talk about it or they'd say, "Gee, whenever you get a chance, maybe you could pay up." You had to see.
It was like a chart this way, now it's a chart like a rocket ship the other one. They're paying a $100 million, hundred billion with a B. Last month I announced that my administration is unsigned in the UN Arms Trade Treaty, which is great for your second amendment. We love our second amendment. And we will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on that very precious second amendment and your rights under the Second Amendment.
I also withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, and unfortunately, just today I felt compelled to authorize new sanctions on Iran's iron, steel, aluminum and copper industries, because I hope to be able, at some point, maybe it won't happen, possibly won't, to sit down and work out a fair deal, we're not looking to hurt anybody.
We want a fair deal, we just don't want them to have nuclear weapons. It's all we want. I recognized Israel's capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem, and just two weeks ago I announced that the United States would recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. That's a big deal. And as rockets rained down on Israel, we reaffirmed America's solidarity with the citizens of Israel in their fight against terror.
They've done just a great job. It's a dangerous place. The Middle East is a dangerous place. We also recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela ,and we forcefully condemn the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime, and our hearts are united with the people of Venezuela and many of their relatives.
Who are here right now with us tonight. The people of Cuba and the people of Nicaragua in their struggle to be free, it'll all happen, folks. It'll all happen. Each of us in this great arena, sort of arena, doesn't have a roof, but these are minor detail, problem's if we had a roof you could never hold these many people.
So we're all united by the same timeless values, we believe in the American Constitution, and we believe in the rule of law. We believe in strong borders, strong families and a strong national defense. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life, we believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms.
We believe that mothers and fathers, not government regulators, know best how to raise our children and teach our great country's values, and we believe in the words of our national motto: In God We Trust. These are the traditions, customs, and principles that bind us together as neighbors, as citizens, as Americans.
These are the values that unite people in the Panhandle. Panhandle. Oh, we love the Panhandle. You all love the Panhandle? I think so. You're incredible people. I tell you, you're incredible people. You're smart, you're loyal, you're unbelievable people. But all across the magnificent state of Florida and all over our country you joined our movement because you rejected the values and betrayals of past politicians.
You stared down a corrupt system that enriched itself at your expense. This system is rigged. I used to say, it is still rigged, but a lot less rigged we're getting rid of a lot of the rigging rapidly folks. You reclaim your destiny, you defended your dignity and you took back your country. You have always been loyal to this nation.
Now you finally have a President who is loyal to you. Thank you. And every day between now and November 3rd, 2020. I think of that. November 3rd, 2020. Boy, it's closer. But every day we're going to keep on working. We're going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Remember I used to tell the story that your governor would come to see me and you'd be winning so much in the state of Florida.
Governor Ron. He'd say, "President, please." in the Oval Office, "Please we're winning too much we're not used to this, Mr. President, we're not used to this. For years and years we've been losers. We've been losing, Mr. President. Now we're winning, we're winning so much. The people of Florida can't stand winning so much.
Can you maybe pull it back a little bit, Mr. President?" And I said, "No, I can't, Ron, I'm sorry." He said, "I thought you'd say that." We're going to keep winning. We've never been winning like we're winning now. You've never had better numbers. You've never had, I think, more loyalty. You look at what's happening to this state ,and you look at what's happening to this country and we're proud again, we're proud again.
With every last ounce of heart and hope, and sweat and soul, we are going to make our stand. We are going to stand for liberty, we are going to stand for justice, we are going to stand for faith, family, and freedom and we are going to stand for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America and together with the proud people of the Panhandle, the proud people of Florida, we will make America wealthy again.
We will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you Florida. Thank you very much.
Thank you Mike. Thank you. Wow. Look at that crowd. That's a nice crowd. That's a nice crowd. If this election is based on crowds, they might as well cancel it because we won. That's for sure. Our opponents have 4 or 500 people and they say how many people they've had. Oh they had a big crowd like about this group right here.
That's what they had. This is a big beautiful crowd. Thank you very much Pensacola, Florida. We love it. I love the state of Florida and I have to tell you we love the panhandle. Did we do well in the panhandle? And you got hit but nobody like you to have built it back. In a little while, you won't even know there was that vicious hurricane.
That was a bad one though. Wasn't it? We got hit a little bit of the state but it's happening fast. It's going good. Rick Scott, everybody's working hard. Made a lot of progress. It was a bad one. That was like a giant tornado. That wasn't a hurricane. That was like a 50 mile wide tornado, incredible. I visited and I've never seen where the houses were gone but the foundations were gone.
The houses and the foundations, nobody's ever seen anything like that but you are great people and we are with you 1,000 percent. You know that. You know that. Great people. In just three days, the people of Florida are going to elect Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis to protect your jobs, defend your borders and continue "Making American Great Again". We're just days away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is a big one. This is a very important election. Has anybody not voted? Raise your hand. Not that bad. But you're going to vote right? You're going to vote. That's not bad though. That's probably 10 percent didn't vote and I have no doubt that you're going to vote for DeSantis and Rick Scott. Right?
We need them. We need them. No games. This is -- this is very serious stuff. This election will decide whether we build on then extraordinary prosperity that we've achieved for our nation. Or whether we let the radical Democrats, and that's what they've become. They've become radical Democrats. In Rick's case, he's going against somebody that's falling asleep.
And in Ron's case, he's going against somebody that's got a lot of energy but he runs one of the worst, one of the biggest problem cities anywhere in the country. He's not doing the job. You don't want to have him running Florida. That I can tell you. They're going to take control of Congress. They want to give away our country.
They want to knock it down with a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to our future. And by the way, did you see those job numbers? Did you see what's going on? Right? They were awfully good numbers. You know, it's very interesting. Some of the fake news was saying I was watching. Why doesn't he talk about the economy?
Why does he talk about immigration and what's coming up with the caravan? Why does he talk about the caravan when he's got maybe the best numbers on the economy in the history of our country? And we can talk about the economy but the fact is we know how well we're doing with the economy and we have to solve problems.
I'm looking to solve problems. Not talk into the fact that we have done a great job and we have done a great job on the economy. So we now have the hottest economy anywhere on earth. We have the best economy that the United States has ever had. In the last month alone we added another 250,000 jobs. Think of that.
And that is despite the hurricanes. You know hurricanes devastate your monthly and your quarterly numbers. This is 250,000 jobs despite your -- I have to -- your hurricane. Now if you add those numbers back, which I won't bother doing. The 250,000 goes really wild but we're not even going to do that. We're going to take it the way it is and it is something but we've added a total of 4.5 million new jobs since the election.
Nobody would have thought that's possible. Including those people back there. Nobody would have said that was possible. Nobody would have said -- if I said on the campaign that we would add 4.5 million new jobs they would go and oh, they'd say terrible things. We are over performing. What we said was great but what we're doing is far greater so that's the way we want to keep it. That's the way we're going to keep it. But the unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years.
That's not bad. And more Americans are working today than ever before. Think of that. In the history of our country, today, more Americans are working than ever before in the history of our country. That's a good sound byte. That's a good sound byte. I was just saying that's awfully tough to beat somebody when I'm debating one of the far left candidates that the Democrats will produce.
Well you have two of them running against our two friends. But can you imagine in the debates we have the most successful economy ever. What are they going to say? We have the best jobs numbers ever. What are they going to say? It's going to be hopefully very easy debates. But we always debate three people, it won't be one it will be three.
It's the person, plus the media against me. So that makes it a little tougher. That makes is a little bit tougher. Remember they way they treated Hillary? Oh Madam Secretary. Oh, what did you have for breakfast Madam Secretary? Did you enjoy it? As far as you Mr. Trump, bah, bah. No. I have -- we have three people.
Three people on that stage. Hispanic American, African-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country. Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.
We're working on that right now. We're taking care of our veterans and we are rebuilding America's military might like we haven't done in 50 years. And everything is made in the USA. It's a good thing. No, we're building our military bigger, stronger, better than ever before and we hope we never have to use it. But you know when you don't have to use it, when you're bigger, better, and stronger.
Right? Then you don't have to use it. When you're weak, you have to use it. When you're strong, you don't have to use it. Under Republican leadership, America is respected again and America is winning again because we are finally putting America first. Right? Could the cameras please span out and just show this crowd?
It would really be nice. Would really be nice. Would you do that? You know, they never like to do that folks. They never like to do that. Could you span out? See they won't turn their camera. They don't want to turn the camera. They never do, unless there's a little problem in which case that camera bends in 15 different directions.
Right? That camera can bend and turn. That's called great equipment. They never show the crowd but people hear the crowd. They hear the crowd. Sounds like a big Florida State or Florida football game. Sounds like a stadium on television. In many ways, it sounds even better. But I wish they would show the crowds because nobody has any clue.
They do. I guess we all do. Right? We all do. I mean, I looked at the crowd size of some of the people that we're competing against. You don't want to be involved with that. One thing you always have plenty of room. That's good. But if crying Chuck Schumer, you know crying Schumer. Nancy Pelosi. Or the legendary genius, Maxine Waters.
If they take power, they will try to wipe away all that we've done and at the same time double and triple and quadruple your taxes. And we're not going to let it happen. They will restore the job killing regulations. You know, I cut more regulations in less than two years than any other Administration has cut in four years, in eight years or in one case more than eight years.
We've cut more. Remember I said, we want to cut two for every one? You know what it ended up? Right now, it's trending at 22 for one. We cut one regulation and we take out 22. A highway that would take 20 years to get approved. We go through a process. You believe an environmental impact process, I know it well, would take 20 years, 18 years, 15 years, 22 years.
We have it down to two and a half years. We want to get it down to one and a half maybe even one. And by the way, we may reject it if it's not good but you're not going to devote an entire lifetime and then find out at the end it's not going to be approved. And it's going to end up costing 10 times or 20 times more which we have many examples, then it was supposed to. So we have it down really good but we're going to get it down even lower.
And again, if it doesn't pass environmental standards, if we do anything to interfere with our clean air or our crystal clean, beautiful water, we won't approve it. Not going to be approved. But we're going to know. We don't have to take 20 years to tell you that do we? They'll take away your healthcare and they'll make it impossible.
They'll impose socialism on the state of Florida. Welcome to Venezuela. And they'll erase America's borders. We have to have a border. If we're going to have a great country, we have to have a great, strong, powerful border. So we're building the wall, as you know, it started. We did $1.6 billion. We've got another $1.6 billion.
We're doing that and we have another third but I want to build it all at one time. And when you look at that caravan and I'm good at building. When you look at that caravan coming up, that's not what we want. That's not for us folks. Not for us. And we want people to come through our strong borders but they have to come in legally.
They have to come in absolutely through a process and they have to come in through merit so that they can help all of the companies that are moving back to Florida and moving back to the United States. We have car companies. We have car companies moving into Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and South Carolina and North Carolina and Florida by the way.
But we have many, many companies moving back and I speak to the top people and I speak to the presidents of countries and the prime ministers of countries. And they all want to be where the action is and we are where the action is now. Didn't used to be. Even two years ago, not a long time. It was going in reverse.
It was going down. Regulations were killing our country. High taxes, all of the other things. And by the way, if Florida -- if you want to pay high taxes, you ought to vote for the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida because you will pay high taxes. And you'll destroy this state that I love and that I live in. I mean I'm here all the time.
This is my home also. Great state. And Rick Scott has done a great job. He's done a great job. A vote for any Democrat this November is to really vote to put extreme, far left politicians in charge of Congress and to destroy your jobs. Slash your incomes. Undermine your safety and put illegal aliens before American citizens.
Not too good. A vote for Republicans is a vote to protect your families, to keep America's economic boom going full speed ahead and it is going. It's going better than ever before. And don't forget, we're now normalizing interest rates. President Obama, we were heading south and he had zero interest. It's really easy to do things with zero interest but we're normalizing rates.
And now, if you think about it -- if you think about it, just take a look. Are they OK darling? You take your time. We got to be with our people. Right? We got to be with our people. Is she OK? Take your time. Do you have a doctor? Doctor please. [Inaudible] what? Yes. Yes. Take that. Move that partition.
Yes. Move it. Take care of the person. OK. Good. You OK? That's good. That's good. That's good. You take your time. We have plenty of time tonight. Right? Plenty of time. Don't forget I know you get here 7-8 hours ago. It's not easy. It's not easy for these folks with those really good prime locations. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you doctor. Thank you doctor. They do a great job. The doctors do a great job. We've got to get their fees down a little bit but other than that. Get their fees down a little bit. Great job doctor. Thank you. But the choice is simple. A Republican Congress means more jobs and less crime.
A Democrat Congress means more crime and less jobs. It's pretty simple. That's cute. We have a number of very special guests with us tonight including a man, don't we love great athletes. I like him. You know, sports is sort of like a microcosm in life. But we have a man who was a heavy weight champion but he was always considered small for a heavy weight but he made people suffer.
Any time this man fought, he had the biggest heart. He had zero, zero body fat. I can tell you. Evander "the Real Deal" Holyfield. Where is Evander? What a great champion. What a great champion. Evander, I've made so much money on Evander. He'd come in at 218 and he'd be fighting people and I could say Riddick Bowe, I could say plenty of them and they were good.
Right Evander? They were good. But he's come in, he'd be 50 pounds lighter and the one thing they knew. It was going to be a painful, painful evening. Evander "the Real Deal", one of the greatest in history in my opinion. Thank you. Great Evander. Thank you very much. Evander Holyfield. And we're also thrilled to be joined by a Florida football legend who truly knows how to win.
He won them all and if he had a great place kicker, he could have even won a couple of more. Right? Bobby will be the first tell you. Bobby Bowden is an incredible man and an incredible coach and a great leader. Bobby. He looks good. A lot of teams would like to have him right now. Right? Come on. Say something.
Come here Bobby.
Thank you brother. Thank you all. Thank you all. Gosh, what a great crowd. You know what I was thinking a while ago? The most powerful man in the world, the most power position in the world is the President of the United States. Also, like some of the other folks tonight. I want you to keep your eye on Ron DeSantis as we vote this year.
I think he'll do a great job, you know that. And then also, our former governor Rick Scott. Look at them good because I know he want them. OK? You know, I came to Florida State in 1963 as -- as -- as an assistant coach. And you know where my recruiting area was? Right here baby. Right here. And we got some great ball players from Pensacola, Florida.
You know it? And, so I -- it's just a pleasure for me to be back. Now, in coaching football, my philosophy was pretty simple. It was -- it was that if whoever gets the best players is going to win. You know. If I got -- if I got better players than you, I'm going to whip you. But if you've got better players than me, you're going to whip me. Now we also know, I know you know this.
A coach can mess that up. Can't he? Coaches can mess that up. But the reason I mentioned that to you, the midterm election, and that's what it's all about, who gets the best players. You know. That's -- that's why I mentioned DeSantis and Scott, because they are the best players. You know. Now, let me -- let me just read you a thought I had.
When you vote, vote against what you think is false. Opt for what you think is true. You can tell a difference, now. There is a difference and don't be deceived. Coach like tomorrow departs itself -- supports itself. You know, because it does. And thank you for letting me be on the program with you President and -- I want to make -- I want to wait -- I want to make one more statement about this man.
Now, see if you think this is true. Trump plus God, hold it, is a majority.
Thank you Bobby. You see that. That's National Championship ring. Good man. Good man. He did it the best for a long time. You know, I had another good coach up last night. I went to Indiana. You saw that. Right? Bobby would respect this guy. Bobby Knight, Indiana. Mike Pence came and we had an incredible group but we had Bobby Knight and it was -- he won 902 games.
Three National Championships. The last undefeated college basketball team, it's amazing. So he was great last night and Bobby thank you very much for being here. Great. Thank you. We're also joined by many terrific Florida Republicans. Your state's next Attorney General, a tremendous person, Ashley Moody.
Ashley. And by the way, you have a very good Attorney General right now. You know that right? Pam. Is Pam? Great. You like Pam right Ashley? OK. Then I like you Ashley. Good luck. I hear you're doing well. Good luck. Very important position. You're next Agriculture Commissioner Matt Caldwell. Matt. Thank you.
Great Matt. Thank you. Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis. Good luck Jimmy. Good job. Good job fellas. And Congressman that helped me so much. They're always with us. They're always fighting for us and they win. They know how to win, like Bobby. They know how to win. Neal Dunn and Matt Gaetz. Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks Neal. Thanks Matt. Great people. So if you don't want to be saying Speaker Pelosi. For the next two years, vote for Neal and Matt. I hear they're doing pretty well. But never assume, please go out and vote. They've heard that before in this business. Right? They're doing well. We don't have to go out and vote.
You have that and then you have suppression, where they suppress the polls. You don't bother to go out and vote. But that didn't happen with us two years ago did it? Huh? That didn't happen. One of the most exciting days in political history but honestly one of the highest rated nights in the history of television.
A lot of good things happened, but most importantly what we did is we won and we won for incredible people in this country. Incredible people. They got what they wanted and we are producing and we did it together. I didn't do it. We all did it together. This Tuesday the people of Florida are going to head to the polls to elect an incredible new Senator.
As your governor, Rick Scott cut your taxes massively by billions of dollars. Think of it. Removed job killing regulations and created more than 1.6 million new Florida jobs. One of the hottest places anywhere on earth. That's what he created. And you know what? You put the mayor Tallahassee -- take a look at the bad job he's doing in Tallahassee.
You put him here, he'll destroy Florida in one year or two years if he's doing a good job. A vote for Rick's far left opponent, Senator Bill Nelson, who I never see. I'm the President of the United States. We have 100 Senators. We have 49 Democrats. I never see him. The only one I see is crying Chuck. He represents everyone.
Bill never calls me and says, you know I'd like to get something from Florida for Florida. Okeechobee, the damn, we're doing that because Rick Scott was driving us all crazy in the White House. He was driving us crazy. He'd call again. It's Rick Scott, governor sir. Rick Scott, I said, oh I know he wants Okeechobee.
As soon as I give him that he wants other things. But honestly, isn't that what you want? So I've never had a call. I've been here almost two years. I've never had a call from Senator Bill Nelson saying could you help me? I've never had a call. But I'll tell you what he is good at and I shouldn't say this but I will.
With Okeechobee, I did it for him because he was just back and forth. He's sending me plans. He's just like a construction job. Right? And it's a big deal. Lake Okeechobee and he's calling and all of a sudden Bill Nelson heard about it and he had a news conference to announce Okeechobee Dam and he had nothing to do with it. So I don't way that's stupid but I will say this.
I don't see Bill Nelson for five and a half years and around election time he's on television every night. But for five and a half years, you don't see him. So, a vote for Nelson is just a vote for Chuck Schumer. The majority leader, how about this one? It's vote really for the group. Diane Feinstein, she did a great job.
She did a great job on Judiciary with her obvious leaks. Remember that? Remember? Remember that? Senator Cornyn of Texas, did you leak? Uh- do I leak? Did we leak? Did we leak? Did we leak? No, you didn't leak. Oh, no we didn't leak. The worst body language we've ever seen. What a mess. And by the way, did you see today?
Right? Now Justice Kavanaugh, then Judge Kavanaugh, great person. It started a whole movement, I mean, what they did to that man. And today, an accuser who said she was raped admitted she was lying. Think of that. She was lying. She never met him. It didn't happen. Can you imagine? And -- and the Democrats were so horrible on everyone.
So horrible. And by the way, what about the others? What are they going to say things like she did? She said it never happened. She never met him. She don't even -- she didn't even know why she did it. And they tried to destroy a great man with a great, incredible family. A scholar, an intellect, she said it never happened.
Can you imagine, if this man, who people predicted 10 years ago would be a Supreme Court Justice some day, because of his intellect. Can you imagine if he didn't get the job because of that? And then you find this out later on? But she admitted nothing happened. She never met him. This is disgraceful. The Democrats.
Bill Nelson voted against Neil Gorsuch and he voted against Brett Kavanaugh. Bill Nelson voted against your tax cuts and he voted against your regulation cuts. Bill Nelson voted against "Kate's Law". He voted for deadly sanctuary cities and Nelson joined every other Senate Democrat in supporting open borders legislation sponsored by Diane Feinstein.
You deserve a Senator who shares your values and who will always have your back. And I will tell you, this is a man who loves the people of Florida. He works as hard as anybody I've ever seen. We all work hard. I work hard. This guy, he is doing -- he's a producer. He's done an incredible job as your governor.
Rick Scott, please come forward.
Good evening Pensacola. Now isn't it exciting to have the President here? Is he taking care of us? Yes. So he's been President for less than two years. Let me tell you the things he's already done. We've had two horrible hurricanes, Irma and Michael. Everyday he called me. What do you need? Everything I asked for he came through.
Everything. You know -- and then you -- you talked -- he talked about Lake Okeechobee. I asked Barak Obama and Bill Nelson to fund a dike at Lake Okeechobee. It's their project. It's a [Inaudible] project. You know how much money I got? Nothing. I did harass the President a little bit about it. I called him a lot.
If he'd invited me to the Oval Office, I said how are we doing on Lake Okeechobee? But he came through. We have all the funding. So all of it will get done in the next four years. Thank you Mr. President. So let's think about Hurricane -- Hurricane Michael. Here's -- it was horrible. Fourteen foot of storm surge, 150 mile an hour winds.
So many people without homes. So many people in trouble. This is the greatest country in the world. People came from all over the country. They didn't say are you a Republican? Are you a Democrat? They say, what do you need? You need water. You need food. You need a tarp. You need some tarp. We'll do it for you.
This is the best place in the world. This is what this President's doing. He's bringing us together to do good things. I'm going to go to Washington to have a can do attitude to represent you whole heartedly to make sure our Federal government takes care of us when we need them. You know, as you all know, I grew up in public housing.
I didn't know my dad. We lived where -- my family was very poor but I -- I was born with a silver spoon on my -- in my mouth. You know why? I grew up in this country where anything is possible. You know, I forgot one point. You know what Bill Nelson -- Bill Nelson texted me he says, why are you doing things for the President?
What am I supposed to do? I mean, when we're in need shouldn't I talk to the President? Should I say what can you do for us? This is a -- this is a massive storm. Shouldn't we get local, Federal and state resources? Yes. So, we have a big choice. All right. Here's your choice. Over here with Bill Nelson, he wants to grow Washington.
What we want to do is grow our economy, not the Washington economy. With Bill Nelson, he wants to raise your taxes. He thinks it's his money for Washington. We want lower taxes. Less money in his pocket. More money in our pockets. That's what this President has done. Tax cuts. Tax cuts. Tax cuts. You know, my mom taught me to be a worker.
Bill Nelson's not a worker. He doesn't show up to work. I have a very specific plan on how we can improve this country. It starts with term limits. You know who ought to be term limited first? Bill Nelson. You know, we have sent so many big talkers to Washington. We need to send more doers to Washington like President Trump and I will do it. Now, here's your job.
Vote. The only thing that matters between now and Tuesday at 7 p.m. is to get every vote out. If we do, we'll have the greatest win ever besides 2016 maybe. Go. So, if you voted make sure you're family and your friends get to the polls and vote. We need to get every vote in we can so we can all go to D.C. and help President Trump turn this economy around.
Make this the greatest nation in the world to grow up in. God Bless America. Good night.
So remember what I told you. Almost two years as President, I never received one call from Senator Nelson to help out the people of Florida. Not a call. Not a call. This man all the time. That's got to mean something. To me, that means a lot. Maybe almost everything. The people of Florida are going to choose a governor to continue the Florida jobs boom and the success boom started by Rick Scott.
Ron DeSantis, I've known him a long time. I mean, I don't want to talk about his education. But he's Harvard. He's Yale. Good student, which is only telling you he's smart but I know a lot of smart guys that don't have what it takes. He does. He's a smart guy. He's a great guy and he'll keep your jobs going way up. He'll keep your taxes going way down.
Ron stands 100 percent with the men and women of law enforcement like we all do. And Ron is running against really a radical socialist named Andrew Gillum. Who will not do good things for Florida. Gillum will tax and regulate your jobs into oblivion. Gillum wants to abolish ICE. Can you believe that? Wants to abolish ICE.
Nobody wants that job but they love it. To them it's a day at the office. They're strong people but they're great patriots and they take care of us. Wants to flood your cities with criminal aliens because that's what's going to happen. And Gillum pledged his support to end all borders. Do you believe that?
End borders. So when you have people camping out on your front lawn remember Gillum. That's what will happen. People will come in, if we don't have those borders. And did you watch tonight? I sent the United States military to our borders. And I looked at those young, great people and I looked at those generals giving the orders and I looked at the way they worked and I watched that barbed wire being put down.
Barbed wire. Got to come in legally folks. You can't come in that way. And by the way caravan, after caravan and we pay these countries where they're formed. Honduras, all of them. We pay them hundreds of millions of dollars. They do nothing for us. They do nothing. They do nothing for us. They had a new one just formed in El Salvador.
We pay them a lot. We pay them all, hundreds of millions of dollars. They do nothing. And did you see Mexico's trying. They are trying. And their military and their police stood guard and the level of viciousness with the rocks being thrown in their face. Their military was hurt. Their police, their law enforcement, they were hurt.
We don't put up with it. We don't put up with it. We don't want -- we don't want that in our country. We're not going to have it in our country. They broke through. Think of it. They broke through the Mexican military and the Mexican police. They broke through. And by the way, these aren't babies. They broke through viciously.
We're not having them. And you know the good thing, they don't break through our military. Nobody does. Nobody's breaking through our military. Gillum's extreme policies would be a total nightmare for the state of Florida that we all love. If you want a bright future for your families and your children, going to take care of your children.
You have only one choice Ron DeSantis for governor. He's going to be a great, great governor. Ron, come on up.
Hello Pensacola. Is this Trump country or what? You know, President Obama was in Florida the other day. He didn't get a crowd this big. Not even close. I want to thank the President for keeping his word on behalf of the American people. When candidate Trump came to Florida, he promised to restart America's economy.
Has President Trump delivered? When candidate Trump came to Florida, he promised to put solid Constitutionalists on our Supreme Court. Has President Trump delivered? When candidate Trump came to Florida, he promised to stand by our veterans. Has President Trump delivered? Candidate Trump came to Florida and promised to relocate our Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
And while no other President delivered, has President Trump delivered? Candidate Trump promised to end the disastrous Iran Deal. Has President Trump delivered? When you make promises and you run for office and you get in the office and you keep it. You are doing right by the people that elected you and that's exactly what he's doing.
I'm proud to be here with my wife Casey and she's going to be the next first lady of the state of Florida. Right over there. I'm also proud in the governor's race. I'm the only candidate running who's worn the uniform and served in Iraq and served in our military. I'm also the only candidate that can say that I've never been -- had my palms greased by an undercover FBI agent while I've been in office.
So here's the mission. We have to protect Florida's future. We need to protect the economic momentum that we have under Governor Scott and under President Trump. I will keep it going and I will build on that success. And we'll have success like we've never had before. But, you've got to have good leadership and you have to keep taxes low.
Andrew Gillum, his great idea is to raise tax 40 percent. That will cost you your jobs. That will cause businesses to leave Florida and it will stop the flow of investment into our state. It would be a historic mistake but here's the thing. That 40 percent tax increase, that's just the increase he's willing to admit to you that he's going to see.
This is a guy that has supported higher taxes his entire career including higher property taxes as Mayor of Tallahassee he wants to repeal the Trump tax cuts, which would mean higher Federal taxes for you. And the non-partisan think tank analyzed all the spending he's promising and they say the only way you can pay for it is either to raise the sales tax to 38 percent or to impose an income tax in Florida.
With me as governor, we will not raise taxes and we will never have an income tax. And we have such a good opportunity to bring more investment to Florida. Mr. President, I just want you to know when I become governor, I'm going to come to Don Jr. and Eric and I'm going to try to bring the Trump Organization to Palm Beach.
We can save you a lot of money. I'll protect Florida's communities by standing with the men and women of law enforcement. I'm not going to attack them like Andrew Gillum has. I'm not going to sign an anti-police pledge. No wonder Tallahassee has the highest crime in Florida. No wonder they have the most murders in their history last year.
Bad leadership and bad judgment. He wants to abolish ICE and have sanctuary cities. No. I can tell you this, when I'm governor we will not have sanctuary cities and Florida will never be a sanctuary state. I will appoint solid Constitutionalists to our state supreme court. Similarly to how the President has appointed these great people to our Federal courts.
We can end judicial activism in Florida one month into my term. So we've got to do that. I will defend your rights including your 2nd Amendment rights. Andrew Gillum has laid out criteria what he would ban. The fact is, he would ban the vast majority of handguns and long guns in the state of Florida. He is hostile to the 2nd Amendment.
He will not protect your rights and he cannot be trusted to be the governor. I'll also protect -- protect your right to pursue the type of healthcare you want. Andrew Gillum supports Bernie Sanders' government run Medicare for all. And it sounds -- it sounds nice at first but then you read the fine print.
It abolishes Medicare for seniors. Medicare Advantage gone. If you get insurance through your job, the government will take it away from you. You'll get dumped on a government run single payer plan. In fact, everybody with health insurance would lose it and get pushed on the single payer except the VA and the Indian Health Service.
So I guess that means that Elizabeth Warren has a 1/1000 percent chance of keeping healthcare. But here's the deal, government has no right to take away the health benefits that you have earned and Andrew Gillum wants to do that. That is wrong and we won't let it happen. So it's an honor for me to be here.
I want to thank the President for coming to Florida. We just have a few days left. And what you need to do is you need to make your voice heard. You will be the determining factor in this election. Are we going to build up the success Florida's had or are we going to put a far left Bernie Sanders, anti-law enforcement, tax raising radical in the governor's mansion?
I don't think so. So vote and get your friends to vote. And when you do, you'll be doing your part to protect Florida's future for a generation and as governor I promise you I will fight the good fight. I will finish the race and I will keep the faith on behalf of the people of Florida. Thank you. God Bless You.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much Ron. Their won't be any sleeping for Ron. No sleeping. You worked and worked. I will say this, Andrew Gillum is not equipped to be your governor. He's just not equipped. It's not for him. It's not for him. He knows it. He won't say it but he knows it. We got to keep this state great. You're going to make it even greater if you do Ron and otherwise I'm telling you it's going to be problems like you've never imagined.
He's not equipped to be your governor. If Democrats gain power on Tuesday, one of their very first projects will be a socialist take over of the American healthcare system. You can't have it. They'll destroy what we're building and what we're going to build. The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for nearly 2 million Florida seniors who depend on it. The Democrat plan is especially unfair to Hispanic-Americans.
One out of every two Hispanic seniors is enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Republicans will protect Medicare for your great, great seniors that we love who earned it and who by the way paid for it. And Republicans will always, just like I said Social Security. Didn't touch it. During the debates they all wanted to do a lot of bad things.
They wanted to do bad things and I said no way. We'll get the money from making good deals on trade. We got plenty of money coming in now. Those trade deals are phenomenal. We took them from being horrible to phenomenal. But we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always. Always. Democrats plan to destroy healthcare also includes raiding Medicare to fund illegal immigrants.
That's what they want to do. As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our sovereignty, overrun our borders and destroy our nation in so many ways and we can't let it happen. They want to invite caravan after caravan and it is a little suspicious how those caravans are starting.
Isn't it? Isn't it a little? And I think it's a good thing maybe that they did it. Did they energize our base or what? They want to sign up the illegal immigrants for free healthcare, free welfare, free education and guess what they really want? They want them voting because they believe they'll be voting for Democrats every single time.
The Democrats only believe in defending the borders of other countries. They don't believe in defending our country. Open borders, come on in means crime. That's what it means. Republicans believe we must defend our borders. We have to defend our country and we must defend our families, our communities and our great American way of life.
And one of the reasons why you have so many people wanting to come up and come into our country and I don't know if you saw the report but there are a lot of bad people in there. Just saw it. Just put it out. They were saying, how do you know they're bad people? Well now we know. We got the reports from their countries.
We got the reports from Mexico. You have a lot of bad people coming into our country and we're not letting them come into our country. But one of the reasons they're coming up is my fault. You know that. Because we have created such an incredible success. We have become so successful with the best job numbers in so many years and everything else.
That people want to come in and take it but they have to come in legally is nothing we can do about it. That's all we're going to do. They have to come in legally. They have to come through merit. Nearly 100 percent of heroin in the United States enters through our southern border. Along with roughly 90 percent of the cocaine, the majority of meth and a substantial portion of the ultra lethal fentanyl which is killing our youth and destroying our people.
These drugs killed last year, over 70,000 Americans. And last year alone, listen to these numbers they're incredible. You know they want to get rid of ICE right? They want to get rid of ICE. Last year alone, ICE officers arrested more than, listen to this, 127,000 criminal aliens. These are people with criminal records.
These aren't like -- these are people that have criminal records here and in the countries from which they come. Including those charged or convicted, a 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes and 100 -- listen to this, 1,800 murders. 1,800 murders. OK. Think of it. But if Democrats get elected they will do everything in their power to dismantle ICE.
They want to turn America into a giant sanctuary city for violent predators and ruthless gang members like MS-13. No thank you. You can have them. And by the way, we have taken out thousands and thousands of gang members from MS-13 and we got them the hell out of our country. Or put them in the clinker. They're bad.
They're bad ones. Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE, the Border Patrol, law enforcement. We will throw the gang members out. We will throw the predators out. They'll be in jail or we're bringing them back where they come from. They're out. If you want to protect criminal aliens, you should vote Democrat.
If you want to protect law abiding Americans vote Republican. It's really very simple. This election is about safety and it's about prosperity. Very simple. For years you watched as you let foreign countries plunder our wealth, shutter our factories and steal our jobs but those days folks are over. You can see that.
They're over. They're over. Look what we've done with other countries. They're respecting us again. You know, our country is respected again. Doesn't it feel different? Really? Doesn't it feel different? Respecting you. We've added half a million manufacturing jobs since the election, now that's going to go to 600,000 very shortly.
600,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember the previous administration said, they're not coming back. You'd need a magic wand. We found the magic wand. Last month alone, we added 32,000 manufacturing jobs one month and that's 1,000 new manufacturing jobs every single day of the month. I recently announced that we are replacing the horrible, horrible NAFTA deal.
One of the worst trade deals in the history of man or womankind with an incredible brand new U.S., Mexico, Canada agreement. I got it done. We got it done. USMCA right? Like YMCA. Remember, if you have a problem remembering it just think of the song YMCA. We love that song. USMCA. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's very abusive trade practices.
Now we're doing very well and they want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. We put tariffs on $250 billion worth of different things they send our country and inflation is staying low. Isn't that amazing? They want to make a deal. Everyday it's promises made, promises kept. We've taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs.
Wait until you see what's going to happen there. And I've been saying it. I called up Pfizer. I called up Novartis a month ago. They raised their drug prices very substantially. And there was no reason for them to do that. And I called up the heads of both companies and others, I say you can't do this. You can't raise your drug prices.
This is not happening like that. And they immediately reduced their drug prices to the same price that it was the day before. They cut out the entire increase. And I respected them for doing that and I appreciated that they did it. Pfizer, Novartis, others, they did it. And I really realized how powerful this position is. Can you imagine?
It's never happened before. It's never happened before and yet with their own President he can use the same words and they won't do it. That's the way it works folks, whether you like it or not. That's the way it works. But we'll reducing drug prices very soon. You're going to see. Secretary Azar has done a fantastic job.
To help critically ill patients get life saving treatments, we passed after 44 years, we passed right to try. We have the greatest pipeline of drugs and cures and everything. We weren't allowed to use it. Now we're allowed to use that pipeline when somebody's very sick, terminally ill, seriously ill. They won't have to go to Asia, Europe, Africa.
They go all over the world looking for hope and we have the greatest medical people in the world right here. Greatest drug companies in the world. Greatest line up in the world and now they sign a paper. They take it and you know what? We have had tremendous results. This was three months ago. Tremendous results.
Passed by Congress, signed by me. For years and years they've wanted to do it. We got it done. We get it done. And last month, I proudly signed the largest bill to fight the opioid epidemic in American history. Largest in the history of our country. $6 billion. We passed Veterans Choice, giving our great veterans the right to see a private doctor when they have to wait in line for a week, for a month, for two months and three months.
They'd be online with a very minor problem. Sometimes they wouldn't be able to see a doctor for so long that by the time they got treatment, they would be terminally ill. Think of that. Just think of that. So now you go out, you see a doctor immediately. We pay for the doctor. We take care of our veterans.
And frankly, this I don't care about it compared to taking care of our veterans, but it's also less expensive if you can believe that. Much less expensive. That's another one. They've wanted to pass it for four decades. They could never get it passed. I got it passed. Here's another one they couldn't get passed for decades, VA accountability.
In order to insure anyone who mistreats our veterans, they have to be accountable meaning, you're fired. Or worse. You're fired. We got it done. Many decades they've been trying to get it done. And you know, for those who think, oh that should be easy. Well you've got to fight the unions and you're got to fight civil service.
You've got to fight everybody. Not easy. Not easy. Over four decades they've been trying to get it. We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military and we gave our great warriors and you have some of them right here. And I know you don't want this. I know you're willing to give this up. You don't care.
But regardless, and if you want you can give it back. We'll work out a system. We gave them the largest pay raise in more than a decade. OK? Take it. You deserve it. Take it. Take it. And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the 6th branch of the American Armed Forces called the Space Force.
The Space Force. Very important. That's where it's at. That's where it's at. I'm not just talking about sending rockets to the moon, sending rockets to Mars. We're doing all that stuff but I mean, that's where it's at militarily. Satellites and so many other things. And I withdrew as Ron said, the United States from the horrible, once sided Iran Nuclear catastrophe deal.
And we just announced that we are putting in place the toughest sanctions ever on the Iranian regime. And as Ron also said, stole my speech. We have recognized the capital of Israel that opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And we opened it already. We didn't just -- we opened it. We converted a building.
They were going to build a new building for probably for about $1.1 billion which would have ended up being $4 billion. How do you build a one story building for $1 billion? Any builders in the house? They'll do it for $65,000. And it will be better but we converted a building that we had for less than $500,000 and it's beautiful on the best site that we already owned, right in Jerusalem.
Best location. We already had it. We already had it. Together we've made extraordinary progress and we are just getting started. But the Democrats want to turn back the clock, throw American into reverse. Not going to happen and return power to a corrupt, selfish ruling class that only looks out for themselves.
You know that. That's why this movement started. That's why it started. Think of it. Think of what we've done. The most successful political movement in the history of our country and I can say that and they never challenge it. What's to challenge? What's to challenge? Nobody -- look at the crowds even now.
I mean, the energy is, I don't know, it seems like the energy's even greater. It's greater. I don't know. But I need you to vote for a Republican House and a Republican Senate. It's very fragile. I can be taken away. All of the things, the tax cuts, the regulation cuts. So we can continue this incredible movement, we have to continue this great, great movement.
We've made so much progress. Remember it's Make America Great Again but our new theme in another year I think. Could probably do it now because we're so far ahead of schedule is, Keep America Great. Keep America Great. Right? With your support, we will keep on cutting your taxes, reducing your regulations and raising your incomes.
We will protect Medicare and we will protect your Social Security. We will defend your right to free speech, religious liberty and we will continue to confirm judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. We will fully secure the border. We will pass "Kate's Law". We will stop sanctuary cities. Stop catch and release.
We will end the visa lottery and chain migration. And we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, terrorists the hell out of our country. We don't want them. We don't want them. We will lift millions of citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity which is the way it's supposed to be. For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America.
That's what they did. They apologized for us. They apologized for your great country. Now you have a President who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Florida and we are proudly standing for our great national anthem. Thank you. Thank you very much. We love our country.
We really love our country. It's been amazing. It's been an amazing period of time. Let's not blow it. Go out, Ron, Rick. Go out and vote for them. Make sure everyone you know votes for them. So I'm asking every citizen from every party, every background and every race, color and creed to reject the Democrat politics of anger and division.
Reclaim our proud and righteous destiny as Americans. I need you to get your family, get your friends, get your neighbors. Get your co-workers and go out and vote Republican. We're going to make this an even greater country. Greater than it's ever been before. We can do it. This Tuesday, I need the people of Florida to send a message to crying Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters and the radical Democrats by voting for Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott.
Tell your friends. Get out and vote. Don't take a chance. Loyal citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country. Returning power to you the American people. It's what we're going. Doing it together. This great state, the state of Florida was settled by pioneers and visionaries who raised up, claiming cities by the sea who helped build America into the greatest nation and the most powerful military the world has every seen.
This state was built by farmers and factory workers and soldiers and sailors. And by those brave Americans who opened the first Naval Air Station at Pensacola. These courageous Americans did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy. Tear down our history and destroy our very proud American heritage.
For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work. We are going to fight and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender and we will always fight on to victory.
Always. Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And Florida together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will Make America Great Again. Thank you Florida. Thank you.
What a crowd. And just so you know from the Secret Service, there aren't too many people outside protesting, OK. That I can tell you. A lot of people in here, a lot of people pouring right now. They can get them in. Whatever you can do, fire marshals, we'll appreciate it.
And I want to thank our great vice president, Mike Pence, for the introduction. As well as my friend Dr. Ben Carson. And thank you to a very, very special man, Franklin Graham, Reverend Franklin Graham, for leading us in prayer. And thank you too Alveda King, the niece of the great Dr. Martin Luther King.
It really shows you that America is indeed a nation of faith, we know that. Well, I'm thrilled to be back in Phoenix, in the great state of Arizona. With so many thousands of hard-working American patriots.
You know I'd love it if the cameras could show this crowd, because it is rather incredible. It is incredible. It is incredible. As everybody here remembers, this was the scene of my first rally speech, right?
The crowds were so big, almost as big as tonight, that the people said right at the beginning, you know, there's something special happening here. And we went to center stage almost from day one in the debates. We love those debates.
But we went to center stage and we never left, right? All of us, we did it together. You were there at the start. You've been there every single day since, and I will never forget.
Believe me, Arizona, I will never forget. And I'm here tonight to send a message: We are fully and totally committed to fighting for our agenda, and we will not stop until the job is done. This evening, joined together with friends, we reaffirm our shared customs, traditions and values.
We love our country. We celebrate our troops. We embrace our freedom. We respect our flag. We are proud of our history. We cherish our Constitution, including, by the way, the Second Amendment. [Crowd chants USA] We fully protect religious liberty. We believe in law and order. And we support the incredible men and of law enforcement.
And we pledge our allegiance to one nation under God. You always understood what Washington, D.C. did not. Our movement is a movement built on love. It's love for fellow citizens. It's love for struggling Americans who've been left behind, and love for every American child who deserves a chance to have all of their dreams come true.
From the inner cities to the rural outposts, from the Sun Belt to the Rust Belt, from east to west and north to south, our movement is built on the conviction that every American from every background is entitled to a government that puts their needs first.
It is finally time to rebuild our country, to take care of our people, and to fight for the jobs our great American workers deserve, and that's what we're doing. [Crowd chants USA]
After our amazing election victory, the forgotten men and women -- remember we used to talk about the forgotten men and women before the election? Guess what? They're not forgotten... anymore, right? Anymore.
No, they're not forgotten anymore folks. In fact, they're trying to figure you out. They're saying the obstructionists, how do we get them to vote for us? I don't think that's going to happen any time soon. We believe that every American has the right to live with dignity.
Respect for America demands respect for all of its people. Loyalty to our nation requires loyalty to each other, We all share the same home, the same dreams and the same hopes for a better future. A wound inflicted upon one member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all.
You saw last night. You saw last night. Did anybody watch last night? Yes. When one part of America hurts, we all hurt. And when one American suffers an injustice, all of America suffers together. We're all together.
It's time for us to follow the example of our brave American soldiers. And I was with a lot of them last night, Fort Myers. No matter where they come from, no matter what faith they practice, they form a single unbreakable team.
That's what we are. We're a team. As a nation, we're a team. They're all united by their devotion to our country and to their mission. It's time for all of us to remember that we are all on the same team. We are all Americans, and we all believe right now in America first.
And it's happening, and it's happening fast. I see all those red hats and white hats. It's all happening very fast. It's called "Make America Great Again." You see what's going on. It's coming back, very fast. We want every child to succeed, every community to prosper and every struggling American to have a chance for a better life.
What happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America. And tonight, this entire arena stands united in forceful condemnation of the thugs who perpetrate hatred and violence. But the very dishonest media, those people right up there with all the cameras. [Booing]
So the -- and I mean truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media, they make up stories. They have no sources in many cases. They say "a source says" -- there is no such thing.
But they don't report the facts. Just like they don't want to report that I spoke out forcefully against hatred, bigotry and violence and strongly condemned the neo-Nazis, the White Supremacists, and the KKK. I openly called for unity, healing and love, and they know it because they were all there.
So what I did -- So what I did is I thought, I'd take just a second, and I'm really doing this more than anything else, because you know where my heart is, OK? I'm really doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are. [Booing]
So here is my first statement when I heard about Charlottesville -- and I have a home in Charlottesville, a lot of people don't know. Here's the first -- can't believe they haven't figured that one out yet.
Now they know. Now they finally know. But I -- I just -- I don't want to bore you with this, but I -- it shows you how dishonest they are. And most of you know this anyway. So here's what I said, really fast, here's what I said on Saturday: "We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia" -- this is me speaking.
We condemn in the strongest, possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence." That's me speaking on Saturday. Right after the event. So I'm condemning the strongest, possible terms, "egregious display," "hatred, bigotry and violence." OK, I think I can't do much better, right? OK. But they didn't want to put this on.
They had it on initially, but then one day he talked -- he didn't say it fast enough. He didn't do it on time. Why did it take a day? He must be a racist.
It took a day. [Booing] Dishonest people. So here is -- here is me -- I hope they're showing how many people are in this room, but they won't.
They don't even do that. The only time they show the crowds is when there's a disrupter or an anarchist in the room. I call them anarchists.
Because, believe me, we have plenty of anarchists. They don't want to talk about the anarchists. So this is me -- "it has no place in America." I'm talking about hatred, bigotry and violence.
It has no place in America. What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives. No citizen should ever fear for their safety, security in our society, and no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play or be with their parents and have a good time. This is me speaking.
Here's further. This is on Saturday, the first one. I did this three times. "We have to come together as Americans with love for the nation and true affection, really" -- and I say this so strongly -- "true affection for each other." I didn't say true affection for you and you. I said for each other, all of us. All of us.
All of us. But they don't report it. They don't -- they just let it go. "Above all else, we must remember this truth, no matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are all Americans first. We love our country, we love our God, and we love our flag." [Crowd chants USA]
And then I went on, this is my first statement, and they said, remember they said, well, he wasn't specific enough. Why wasn't he more specific? So in my second statement, I got really specific, and they said, why didn't he do it faster? The -- I'm telling you folks, look, look, I know these people probably better than anybody.
And a lot of people have a problem with it, because look, what happens with them, if they're doing a story about me, I know if it's honest or false. If you're reading a story about somebody, you don't know. You assume it's honest, because it's like the failing New York Times, which is like so bad.
It's so bad. [Booing] Or the Washington Post, which call a lobbying tool for Amazon, OK, that's a lobbying tool for Amazon. Or CNN, which is so bad and so pathetic, and their ratings are going down. [Booing] Right? [Crowd chants CNN Sucks]
But all the networks -- I mean, CNN is really bad, but ABC this morning -- I don't watch it much, but I'm watching in the morning, and they have little George Stephanopoulos talking to Nikki Haley, right? Little George. And -- and he talks about the speech I made last night, which believe it or not, got great reviews, right?
They had a hard time. They were having a hard time because it was with soldiers, we were somber, we were truthful, we were doing -- we were saying things -- and it really did.
So, he talked about it for like that much, then he goes, "Let's get back to Charlottesville." Charlottesville. And Nikki was great. She's doing a great job, by the way.
So now, I say we have to heal our wounds and the wounds of our country. I love the people of our country, the people, all of the people. It says I love all of the people of our country.
I didn't say I love you because you're black, or I love you because you're white, or I love you because you're from Japan, or you're from China, or you're from Kenya, or you're from Scotland or Sweden. I love all the people of our country. So, I said here's my -- this is -- by the way folks, this is my exact words: "I love all the people of our country.
We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make it great for all of the people of the United States of America." And then they say, is he a racist? Is he a racist? Then, I did a second one. So then I did a second one. Don't bother, it's only a single voice.
And not a very powerful voice. How did he get in here? He's supposed to be with the few people outside. How about -- how about all week they're talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside.
Where are they? Well, it's hot out. It is hot. I think it's too warm.
You know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they've got clubs and they've got everything -- Antifa! So on August the 14th -- so that was it, and I said all people, I love all people, everything, right?
Now I figure I'm going to do it again. I'll be even more specific. So I said, based on the events that took place over the last weekend in Charlottesville, I'd like to provide the nation with an update.
Because that was right after the event, the first one, right? An update on ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everybody. To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable, justice will be delivered. That's what I said.
Listen to that, I said that, but they don't show that. They don't show it. They take -- they'll take one thing, like, seriously, he was late was the best thing.
He was late. So I said, to anyone who acted criminally in this weekends racists violence. OK, then I go, we must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence.
We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans, right? Then I said, racism is evil. Do they report that I said that racism is evil? You know why? Because they are very dishonest people. So I said, racism is evil.
Now they only choose, you know, like a half a sentence here or there and then they just go on this long rampage, or they put on these real lightweights all around a table that nobody ever heard of, and they all say what a bad guy I am.
But, I mean do you ever see anything -- and then you wonder why CNN is doing relatively poorly in the ratings. Because they're putting like seven people all negative on Trump.
And they fired Jeffrey Lord, poor Jeffrey. Jeffrey Lord. I guess he was getting a little fed up, and he was probably fighting back a little bit too hard.
They said, we've better get out of here; we can't have that. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold true as Americans.
Now let me ask you, can it be any better than that, in all fairness? And you know I mention that, but to the best of my knowledge when there was a big problem, Barack Obama never said it took place because of radical Islamic terrorists, he never said that, right.
He doesn't have to say... [Booing] You know why? Because they have a double standard. Because the media is totally dishonest, and they have a double standard.
You never heard them say that. And in fact, if you use the term you'd get criticized. But with me, they wanted me to say it, and I said it.
And I said it very clearly, but they refused to put it on. "Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike the very core of America." These are my words. This was on Monday, August 14th.
So you had Saturday; you had Monday. You know, I was going to do one of these every week, but you would never get it right. "In times such as these, America has always shown its true character.
Responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice." And then I finished, I said, "We will defend or protect the sacred rights of all Americans." All is capitalized times five. Not just you.
And we will work together so that every citizen -- every citizen is free to follow their dreams and their hearts and to express the love and joy in their souls. OK now, I mean -- so they were having a hard time with that one, because I said everything.
I hit him with neo-Nazi. I hit them with everything. I got the white supremacists, the neo-Nazi.
I got them all in there, let's say. KKK, we have KKK. I got them all.
So they're having a hard time. So what are they say, right? It should have been sooner. He's a racist.
It should have been sooner, OK. So it should have been -- so then the last one, on Tuesday -- Tuesday I did another one: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.
It has no place in America." But they also said that he must be a racist because he never mentioned the driver of the car, who is a terrible person, drove the car and he killed Heather, and it's a terrible thing.
But they said I didn't mention, so these are my words. "The driver of the car is a murderer, and what he did was a horrible, inexcusable thing." They said I didn't mention it. And then they asked me, just to finish it, they asked me, what about race relations in the United States? Now I have to say they were pretty bad under Barack Obama, that I can tell you.
But, they asked me the question. And I said, well, I think jobs can have a very big and positive impact. I think if we continue to create jobs like I've done -- over one million since I've been in office...
Way over one million. I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I'm creating jobs, I think that's going to have a tremendously positive impact on race relations. I do.
I do. And the other thing -- very important -- I believe wages will start going up, because we now have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in 17 years, so you're going to see wages go up, right? They haven't gone up for a long time.
I believe wages now, because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up, and I think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.
So that was my words. Now, you know, I was a good student. I always hear about the elite.
You know, the elite. They're elite? I went to better schools than they did. I was a better student than they were.
I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House, too, which is really great. I think -- you know what? I think we're the elites. They're not the elites.
So the point is -- and I didn't want to bore you, because you understand where I'm coming from. You people understand. But the point is, that those were three different -- there were two statements and one news conference.
The words were perfect. They only take out anything they can think of, and for the most part, all they do is complain. But they don't put on those words.
And they don't put on me saying those words. The media can attack me. But where I draw the line is when they attack you, which is what they do.
When they attack the decency of our supporters. You are honest, hard-working, taxpaying -- and by the way, you're overtaxed, but we're going to get your taxes down. You're taxpaying Americans who love our nation, obey our laws, and care for our people.
It's time to expose the crooked media deceptions, and to challenge the media for their role in fomenting divisions. And yes, by the way -- and yes, by the way, they are trying to take away our history and our heritage. You see that. [Booing] And -- and I say it, and you know, we're all pros. We're all, like, we have a certain sense. We're smart people.
These are truly dishonest people. And not all of them. Not all of them.
You have some very good reporters. You have some very fair journalists. But for the most part, honestly, these are really, really dishonest people, and they're bad people.
And I really think they don't like our country. I really believe that. And I don't believe they're going to change, and that's why I do this.
If they would change, I would never say it. The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself, and the fake news. Oh, that's so funny.
Look back there, the live red lights. They're turning those suckers off fast out there. They're turning those lights off fast.
Like CNN. CNN does not want its falling viewership to watch what I'm saying tonight, I can tell you. I mean, the advantage I have -- the advantage I have is that we do have a big voice.
And you know, they're always saying, like Twitter or social media -- if I didn't have social media, I wouldn't be able to get the word out. I probably wouldn't be standing here, right? I probably wouldn't be standing here right now. If I don't have social media, I probably would not be standing.
And do you ever notice, when I go on and I'll put, like, out a tweet or a couple of tweets, "He's in a Twitter-storm again!" I -- I don't do Twitter-storms. You know, you'll put out a little tweet: "I'm going to be with the veterans today." They'll say, "Donald Trump is in a Twitter-storm."
These are sick people. You know the thing I don't understand? You would think -- you would think they'd want to make our country great again, and I honestly believe they don't.
I honestly believe it. If you want to discover the source of the division in our country, look no further than the fake news and the crooked media, which would rather get ratings and clicks than tell the truth. I mean, the New York Times has written some stories.
How about this? The New York Times essentially apologized after I won the election, because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized. I would say they did. They say, well, it wasn't really that much of an apology.
Because they were losing so many people, because they were misled. And I figured, this is great. And for about two weeks I got good coverage.
Then they reverted back into worse than ever before. You know, it's like one of those things. The Washington Post is terrible.
But these are dishonest -- but let me tell you, you have some great, honest papers. You have some great networks. I must tell you, Fox has treated me fairly.
Fox treated me fairly. They've treated me fairly. Hey, I'll let you know.
You know what? Some day they might not treat me fairly, and I'll tell you about it, OK? But they've treated me fairly, and I don't mean all good. I get plenty of bad on Fox, too. But at least it's within reason.
And Hannity? How good is that? How good is Hannity? And he's a great guy, and he's an honest guy. And "Fox and Friends in the Morning" is the best show, and it's the absolute, most honest show, and it's the show I watch. Not only does -- oh boy, those cameras are going off.
Oh, wow. Why don't you just fold them up and take them home? Oh, those cameras are going off. Wow.
That's the one thing, they're very nervous to have me on live television, because this can happen. Now, you know what? I'm a person that wants to tell the truth. I'm an honest person, and what I'm saying, you know is exactly right.
Not only does the media give a platform to hate groups, but the media turns a blind eye to the gang violence on our streets, the failures of our public school, the destruction of our wealth at the hands of the terrible, terrible trade deals made by politicians that should've never been allowed to be politicians.
And the unaccountable hostility against our incredible police, who work so hard at such a dangerous job. My administration is committed to the idea that all Americans have the right to live in safety, security and peace.
We believe in the rule of law, because we know that freedom cannot exist if our people are not safe. And how safe are you at a Trump rally? Remember at the beginning, remember when this already started? When this started at the beginning, they used to send in thugs. They had -- our people are tougher than them, so it wasn't always very good for them.
But they'd send in thugs, and our people would protect themselves, and then you'd go home and you'd watch this violence. Let me tell you, see this room? You've got people outside, but not very many. But see this room? You're safe in this room.
You're very safe in this room. It's a big room. The most sacred duty of government is to protect the lives of its citizens, and that includes securing our borders, and enforcing our immigration laws.
By the way, I'm just curious. Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe? So, was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job? That's why... He should have had a jury, but you know what? I'll make a prediction.
I think he's going to be just fine, OK? But -- but I won't do it tonight, because I don't want to cause any controversy. Is that OK? All right? But Sheriff Joe can feel good. The people of Arizona know the deadly and heartbreaking consequences of illegal immigration, the lost lives, the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking.
MS-13 -- we're throwing them out so fast, they never got thrown out of anything like this. We are liberating towns out on Long Island. We're liberating.
Can you imagine, in this day and age -- in this day and age in this country, we are liberating towns. This is like from a different age. We are taking these people.
They don't shoot people, because it's too fast and not painful. They cut them up into little pieces. These are animals.
We are getting them out of here. We're throwing them in jails, and we're throwing them out of the country. We're liberating our towns.
You're seen it. You've lived it, and you elected me to put a stop to it. And we are doing a phenomenal job of putting a stop to it.
That I can tell you. After years of defending other countries borders -- can you believe we fight for other countries; we want to defend their borders -- we're finally defending our own borders. And we're showing compassion for these struggling American workers who are now starting to see the light because plants are coming pouring back into our country.
And by the way, we're doing a lot of good work on that, but a lot of people are coming back in. We have Foxconn, they make the iPhones, as you know, for Apple, and so many companies are building now in our country. Including the auto companies who are coming back.
Years of uncontrolled immigration have placed enormous pressure on the jobs and wages of working families, and they've put great burdens on local schools and hospitals.
While this may be good for a handful of special interests, it's unfair to working people of all backgrounds all throughout our country. We want every American community to succeed, including our immigrant communities, but they can't do that if we don't control our borders.
Earlier today, I visited with the incredible men and women of ICE and the Border Patrol during a visit to Yuma Sector. I was over at the Yuma Sector. It was hot.
It was like 115 degrees. I'm out signing autographs for an hour. I was there.
That was a hot day. You learn if you're in shape if you can do that, believe me. And they actually told me -- actually, sir, it's relatively cool today.
Can you believe that? [Laughter] But it was great. And I met with the Border Patrol and I met with ICE, and these are incredible people; the job they do. And in fact, General Kelly, who was in charge of Homeland Security, where people coming in down 78 and almost 80 percent.
He did so good, I made him my chief of staff, right? That made sense. John, where's John? Where is he? Where's General Kelly? Get him out here. He's great.
He's doing a great job. But we did a lot before anything happened, we did a lot. We respect and cherish our ICE officers and our Border Patrol agents, and we respect and cherish our police officers, and our firemen, and all of our uniform services.
But during that visit, I heard first hand from the frontline agents about the security threats they confront each and every day, and I pledged my continued resolve to them, and all of you, to keep our country safe.
All around the nation, I have spent time with the wonderful Americans whose children were killed for the simple reason that our government failed to enforce our immigration laws, already existing laws. And I promised these families, the deaths of their loved ones will not have been in vain.
I promised them. I know so many of them. One by one we are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminals who prey on our people.
We are throwing them out of the country or we're putting the hell, fast in jail. We are cracking down on these sanctuary cities that shield criminal aliens, finally. And we are building a wall on the southern border which is absolutely necessary. [Crowd Chants Build that Wall]
Build that wall. Now the obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it. But believe me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.
Let me be very clear to Democrats in Congress who oppose a border wall and stand in the way of border security: You are putting all of America's safety at risk. You're doing that. You're doing that.
Again, the Border Patrol today, I said, how important is the wall to some of the folks? I met with a lot of them. And they looked at me, they said, it's vital. It's vital.
It's so vital. And you know, we have walls. I don't know if you know, we're already starting to fix a lot of the walls we already have, because we don't have to rebuild them.
And we want walls that you can see through in a sense. You want to see what's on the other side. But we're starting to fix a lot of the walls.
We've done a lot of work. But I said to them, how are we doing and how important are the walls? And they said, Mr. President, you have no idea.
It is desperately needed. We're going to have our wall. We're going to get our wall.
And that wall is also going to help us, very importantly, with the drug problem, and the massive amounts of drugs that are pouring across the southern border. My administration will never back down in demanding immigration control. The American people voted for immigration control.
That's one of the reasons I'm here, and that is what the American people deserve, and they're going to get it. So you put pressure, but believe me, one way or the other, we're going to get that wall. Immigration security is also a matter, remember this, of national security.
That's why we're implementing tough new vetting and screening protocols to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. You look at what just happened in Spain and so many other places. Nope.
We're really vetting. We're tough. Does anybody want me to be soft on the vetting or would you like -- [Crowd yells No] "Extreme vetting" -- I came up with that term.
That's what it has to be. So I have a message for Congress tonight: You're job is to represent American families, American people, American workers. That's your job.
You need to represent them on the border, on taxes, on healthcare -- one vote -- and on every other issue that affects their lives. And for our friends in the Senate, oh boy -- the Senate, remember this -- look, the Senate, we have to get rid of what's called the filibuster rule; we have to. And if we don't, the Republicans will never get anything passed.
You're wasting your time. We have to get rid of the filibuster rule. Right now, we need 60 votes and we have 52 Republicans.
That means that eight Democrats are controlling all of this legislation. We have over 200 bills. [Booing] And we have to speak to Mitch and we have to speak to everybody.
And I want to tell you, we have some great, great Republican senators. We really do, and they fought like hell to get that thing approved. They fought.
They really did. They really fought. Now, even on healthcare, because of reconciliation, which, if you don't know, it doesn't matter.
It's a trick. We needed 51 votes. But when you need 51, and you have 52, and we include the vice president, who always votes with us.
He's the greatest. But you have no margin. But some of the best things in healthcare require 60 votes.
So even when you say we're voting on healthcare, like across state lines, purchase across state lines. One of the most important things, I've been talking about it for two years during debates. It gives competition.
Insurance companies come in, your prices go way down. Arizona is a disaster in terms of the price increase of your insurance, 116 percent interest. You got to get rid of the filibuster rule.
You've got to go to a majority. You've got to go to 51 votes, and if they don't do that they're -- they're just wasting time. All of the Democrats in Congress, that's the only thing they do well.
They do one thing well. You know what it's called? They have no ideas. They have no policies.
They obstruct. That's all they do. They're word is, we resist.
They don't resist; they obstruct. It's all they're good at. It's all they're good at.
That's all they do. On healthcare, they have 48 Democrats. We got no votes.
We got no votes. And it would have been great healthcare. And by the way, would have been great healthcare for Arizona.
Would have been great. So the Democrats have no ideas, no policy, no vision for the country other than total socialism and maybe, frankly, a step beyond socialism from what I'm seeing. [Booing]
Under they're plan for America, your taxes will double or triple, your service will diminish and your borders will be left wide open for everybody to come in and enjoy our country. [Booing]
Obamacare is a disaster and think -- think, we were just one vote away from victory after seven years of everybody proclaiming repeal and replace. One vote away. One vote away.
We were one vote away. Think of it, seven years the Republicans -- and again, you have some great senators, but we were one vote away from repealing it. [Crowd chanting] But, you know, they all said, Mr.
President, your speech was so good last night, please, please, Mr. President don't mention any names. So I won't.
I won't. No I won't vote -- one vote away, I will not mention any names. Very presidential, isn't' it? Very presidential.
And nobody wants me to talk about your other senator, who's weak on borders, weak on crime, so I won't talk about him. [Booing] Nobody wants me to talk about him. Nobody knows who the hell he is.
And now -- see, I haven't' mentioned any names. So now, everybody's happy. But we are going to get rid of Obamacare.
I will never stop -- one vote -- I will never stop. We're going to get rid of Obamacare. Every day we're keeping our promises, and that includes our promises to our great, great veterans.
Who's a veteran here? It's getting better, getting really good. Nobody's fixed it -- nobody's been able to do it. And remember, I'm only here for less than eight months, you know.
When they talk about Obamacare, it was years. When they talk Hillary Clinton spent eight years trying to get... [Booing] Eight years trying to get health care. [Crowd chanting] Well, it's obvious that we won the state of Arizona, do you agree with that? It's pretty obvious. And we won it by a lot. And I hear we're winning it by even more right now.
But if you think about it, Clinton, they spent eight years that they weren't able to get health care. Other administrations spent all of their time, they weren't able to get it. Obama, what he did to get it.
What he did to get it, including the guy, Gruber. Did you see Gruber got fired yesterday? He got fired because he defrauded somebody or something. Something very bad happened.
Check it out. Something happened. Gruber, who lied about Obamacare, who called everybody fools for believing it.
Obamacare is gone. It's a disaster. It's gone.
Premiums in other states are going up in numbers that are even higher than the state of Arizona. Insurance companies are fleeing, and it's gone. So we're going to -- I really believe that the Republicans -- and maybe we'll get a couple of senators that think they're going to lose their race on the Democratic side, maybe, but we'll get it fixed.
One vote -- speak to your Senator, please. Speak to your Senator. We're reforming the V.A.
to ensure our veterans have the care they so richly deserve, including choice -- choice -- choice. In other words, if you've got to wait for seven days and you're not feeling well, you go see a doctor and we pay for your doctor. Isn't that good? And we've got legislation approved that everybody said was impossible.
It's called V.A. Accountability. If somebody treats our veterans badly, we can fire them.
We say you're fired; get out of here. Everybody said -- everybody said you couldn't get that -- they've been trying to get that passed for 40 years. We got great legislation.
You ever hear of these liars back there, where they say, but Trump hasn't gotten -- I think we've gotten more in a short period of time, in this seven months,
I think we've gotten more than anybody, including Harry Truman, who was number one, but they will tell you we've got none. So we got V.A. Accountability so that you can fire people that are treating our veterans badly or aren't doing their jobs.
Isn't that great? We've also obtained historic increase in defense spending to prevent and deter conflict. We believe in peace through strength. We're building up our military like never before.
Thousands and thousands of brave Americans have paid the ultimate price for our freedom. Now it's up to us to preserve and protect their legacy. Last night, as you know, I laid out my vision for I'm honorable and enduring outcome in a very tough place, a place where country has failed, Afghanistan.
This is the place where terrorists are trained, where you have people that are not exactly United States fans, can I say that? And I will tell you then what we're going to do with our incredible military, they're going to make unbelievable sacrifices, and they've already made, in some cases, the ultimate sacrifice.
But we're fighting for them. Our warfighters deserve the tools they need, and the trust they've earned to fight and to win.
Fight and to win. And you see what's going on in North Korea. All of a sudden, I don't know -- who knows.
But I can tell you, what I said, that's not strong enough. Some people said it's too strong, it's not strong enough. But Kim Jong Un, I respect the fact that I believe he is starting to respect us.
I respect that fact very much. Respect that fact. And maybe -- probably not -- but maybe something positive can come about.
They won't tell you that, but maybe something positive can come about. Every American deserves a government that protects them, honors them, defends them, and fights for them.
And by the way, speaking of that, you have three congressman in the audience and your governor who met me at the plane, and he's now inside, but he said I want to spend my time outside on security.
I said, I think that's a great idea, governor. But not that many people showed up so I don't think it should be much of a problem. But you have a hell of a governor, Governor Ducey.
You have a great governor. And we have three congressman, a friend of mine who has been so great to me, Trent Franks. Where is Congressman Franks? Where is he? Get over here.
Paul Gosar, Congressman, Congressman Andy Biggs. Get up here, fellow. Thank you, fellows.
Thank you, congressman. Never let them go, folks. Never let them go.
Don't ever lose them. Thank you, fellows. So, in Washington, we're taking power out of the hands of donors and special interests, and putting that power back into the hands of the people that voted for us, OK? For us.
The same failed voices in Washington who opposed our movement are the same people who gave us one terrible trade deal after another; who gave us one foreign policy disaster after another; who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, and our jobs. We don't need advice from the Washington, D.C. swamp. [Booing]
We need, right now, to drain the swamp. That's what's happening, too, believe me. Washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves.
But I don't come to Washington for me. You know, I've had a great life. I've had great success.
I've enjoyed my life. Most people think I'm crazy to have done this. And I think they're right.
But I enjoy it, because we've made so much -- I don't believe that any president -- I don't believe that any president has accomplished as much as this president in the first six or seven months. I really don't believe it. Including -- including a great Supreme Court justice, Justice Gorsuch.
Big [Inaudible]. I came to Washington for you. Your dreams are my dreams.
Your hopes are my hopes. And your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day. It's so important.
Our agenda is the pro-worker agenda. We've accomplished historic amounts in a short period of time. We've signed more than 50 pieces of legislation.
They said we've signed none -- none. We've signed 50; appointed Justice Gorsuch; nominated 31 new federal judges, with many more on the way. So, importantly, we have aggressively canceled job-killing regulations, and we're unleashing job-creating American energy like we've never unleashed before.
We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, and it's just been announced that a second, brand-new coal mine, where they're going to take out clean coal -- meaning, they're taking out coal.
They're going to clean it -- is opening in the state of Pennsylvania, the second one. And the state of West Virginia, which was way behind and lagging, was now, in terms of GDP increase, second last quarter to the state of Texas.
How about that? West Virginia. And they have a great governor in West Virginia, Governor Jim Justice, who just quit the Democrats and joined the Republican Party. In the proud tradition of America's great leaders, from George Washington -- please, don't take his statue down, please.
Please. Does anybody want George Washington's statue? No. Is that sad? Is that all sad? To Lincoln, to Teddy Roosevelt, I see they want to take Teddy Roosevelt's down, too.
They're trying to figure out why. They don't know. They're trying to take away our culture.
They are trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for 100 years.
You go back to a university, and it's gone. Weak, weak people. We are going to protect American industry.
We are going to protect the American worker. No longer will we allow other countries to close our factories, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth. We are building our future with American hands, American labor, American iron, aluminum, and steel.
We will buy American, and we will hire American. I immediately withdrew the United States from the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership. Would have been a disaster.
And you know, that one of the worst deals that anybody in history has ever entered into. We have begun formal renegotiation with Mexico and Canada on NAFTA. And I must be honest, and I've been talking about NAFTA for a long time, and I'm sorry it's taken six months, but we have to give notice.
You have to see this. We have to give notice, and after the notice is given, you have to wait a long time. Then you have to give another one, then you have to wait a long time.
Anyway, we started two days ago, Bob Lighthizer. Personally, I don't think we can make a deal, because we have been so badly taken advantage of/ They have made such great deals, both of the countries, but in particular, Mexico, that I don't think we can make a deal. So I think we'll end up probably terminating NAFTA at some point, OK? Probably.
But -- but I told you from the first day, we will renegotiate NAFTA, or we will terminate NAFTA. I personally don't think you can make a deal without a termination, but we're going to see what happens, OK?
You're in -- you're in good hands, I can tell you. We are unleashing American energy, and I withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord.
People have no idea how bad that was for this country. Great for other countries. We were like the lap dog.
Great for other countries. Our country was so behind. Since I took the oath of office, we've added far more than one million jobs in the private sector.
Unemployment is, right now, at almost a 17-year low. Wages are rising. The stock market is at its all-time high in history, and economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent.
Remember, everybody said you won't bring it up to 1 percent. You won't bring it up to 1.2 percent. And we've just started.
Those regulations that we've gotten rid of, which -- and we're going to have some regulation, but it's going to be sensible regulation. Those regulations are unleashing our economy. So we have a GDP, it was shocking, about two weeks ago it was announced for the quarter: 2.6 percent.
Remember, I said we're going to try and hit 3 percent? We're already at 2.6. Maybe I'll have to increase my offer. And so many of those people, you know, the Economic Council? When it got a little heat with the lies from the media, they sort of said, Oh, we'll take a pass.
Not all of them, but some of them did. But I remember the ones that did. But they'll say, We take -- oh, we'll take -- but people are now calling me, people that have been, like, we'll take a pass -- Don, can we get together for lunch? Let's do it privately, instead of through a council.
These people just don't get it. They are calling, and they're saying, how about getting together privately? They like it better. Why should they be on a council? You know, that's the way it is, folks.
That's the way it is. To bring more jobs and industry to our shores, we are committed to passing the first major tax reform in over 30 years. Now, we need the help of Congress, please.
OK? We need the help of Congress. And we really could use some Democrat help. We're giving you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.
The Democrats are going to find a way to obstruct. If they do, remember, they are stopping from getting a massive tax cut. Just remember that, OK? America's crushing business tax is a massive, self-inflicted, economic wound.
We have one of the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, pushing jobs and wealth out of our country. That is why we are going to lower the tax on American business, to bring back those companies, bring them back to America. We want more products stamped with the letters, "Made in the U.S.A.".
We also want everyday Americans to be able to keep more of their own money. So for the Democratic senators, especially the ones where I won their states by 20 and 30 points, I really hope you're going to come over to our side. Because again, when you have 52 Republicans, if you lose like two, that's the end.
You know what, as good as something is, it's hard to get 51 out of 52. So I hope some of the Democrats that are going to lose their election will come over and give everybody a big beautiful tax cut, which is going to be great for the economy. It's time to pass a tax cut for the middle-class families.
We will make America the best place in the world to hire, grow and start a business again. We want to lift our people from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. We're going to do an infrastructure bill.
We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, waterways, all across our beautiful land. Our greatest creations, our most incredible buildings, our most beautiful works of art are just waiting to be brought to life. American hands will build this future.
American energy will power this future. We have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently. And American workers will bring this future to life.
We are the nation that dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, put a man on the moon, and defeated communism. We can do anything, we can build anything and we can dream anything. It's time to remember what our brave soldiers never forgot.
Americans share one flag, one home and one glorious destiny. We live according to the same law, raise our children by the same values, and we are all made by the same Almighty God.
As long as we remember these truths, as long as we have enough strength and courage in ourselves, then there is no challenge too great, no task too large, no dream beyond our reach.
We are Americans, and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. This is our moment.
This is our chance. This is our opportunity to recapture our dynasty like never before, to rebuild our future, to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in America. Freedom will prevail, our values will endure, our citizens will prosper, Arizona will thrive, and our beloved nation will succeed like never, ever before.
So to Americans young and old, near and far, in cities small and large, we say these words again tonight: We will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again.
We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you Arizona.
God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.
That's right, USA. And hello, Kentucky. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be back in the heartland with thousands of loyal, hard-working American patriots. In just 24 days, the people of Kentucky -- we love Kentucky -- greatest horses in the world and plenty of other things -- are going to elect an incredible slate of Republican candidates to protect your jobs, defend your borders, and continue making America great again.
Just hours ago, we celebrated another tremendous victory for the American people. You know what I'm talking about. We're having a lot of victories, folks. Can you handle it? In the Oval Office of the White House, I welcomed home Pastor Andrew Brunson, great man, from Turkey. He is now free from jail. Think of that, 35-year jail sentence, 35 years.
Not anymore. He's back with his family, together with his wife, and he is on American soil. And it's a beautiful family. They're all together. And I want to thank President Erdogan of Turkey. He was -- he was terrific. We all worked together. It wasn't easy. It wasn't easy. That one wasn't easy. And we don't pay ransom.
We don't pay ransom. But I do -- I want to thank the president. I want to thank the people of Turkey. And I think we'll probably now really establish a terrific relationship with Turkey. We appreciate it. This evening, in the wake of Hurricane Michael, our thoughts are with our fellow citizens in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.
They got hit hard. They got hit hard, especially when you look at -- when you look at Florida, did you ever see anything like that? And you look at Georgia, Georgia got hit hard. That was some wind force. Up to 200 miles -- almost 200 miles an hour, one of the most vicious we've ever been hit with. So I just want to thank all of those incredible people, the people of FEMA, the first responders... law enforcement, and all of the thousands of federal employees and National Guard, all of the personnel, they're now on the ground, they're supporting this really major recovery.
I will say, you have thousands of electrical trucks all lined up, they're following in, they're getting the roads cleared, not easy. And they have done some job. You had 600,000 people without electric. In one day, they got it down to 250,000. That's some job, one day. And we will not rest until the job is done.
We're here tonight to discuss everything we have accomplished together in less than two years' time. Think of it. Think of it. And I'm here tonight, although I've been back many times, I love this state... to thank the people of Kentucky for 2016. We didn't have to wait too long for that. We didn't have to wait too long for that.
Remember, the vote is in, the polls have closed in Kentucky, Donald Trump is the winner of Kentucky. That was fast. That was fast. And to make sure that America's extraordinary comeback, we want to make sure it continues full speed ahead. We don't want Democrats... that are coming from a different place, we don't want them getting in office.
All they'll do is abstract. Under Republican leadership, America is booming. It's thriving. America is winning again because we are finally putting America first. [Audience chants USA] Our country's unemployment rate has just fallen to 3.7 percent, the lowest in over 50 years. Fifty years. Median household income has reached an all-time high.
That's pretty good. It means you're making more money than you've ever made before. I don't know how much better, but we're going to get it up higher. We have eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And some of you will love this, and I'm proud of it, these are great people, it's a great resource when properly used.
We have ended the war on clean, beautiful coal. We're putting our miners back to work like never before. They're going back, back, back. And after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. And we are doing it with American iron, aluminum, and look at what happened to steel.
You see the comeback with steel? Everyone's going back to work. The steel mills are opening up, U.S. Steel, Nucor. They're all opening up their steel mills. That was faster than I thought. And we're stopping the dumping. And if they want to dump, they can but they got to pay a lot. So if you think about it, so true, despite our size, America is now the hottest country anywhere in the world.
This is where people want to be. Since my election, we've picked up in worth $11.7 trillion. Think of that. Think of it. And we are going to get along great with China, but we're doing things with China, and they've dropped about $20 trillion. But you know what? They're going to be just fine, but they have to treat us fairly.
They have to treat us fairly. Right? That's right. And every day, we are living by our motto, promises made, promises kept. [Audience Chants Trump] And you look back there at the fake news media, look at them. Look at them. It's like the Academy Awards every time. You know, I'd like to walk into a place one night and not have any of these guys.
Boy. It gets bigger and bigger. But even they have said that President Trump, and you know they probably get fired the next day, that President Trump made promises during the campaign, and I've actually produced more than the promises I made. How often do you hear that? And we all produced it together. We have incredible people.
Mitch and Rand, and we all produced it together. We have a great team. But we need more of them. We need more Republican votes. We have a majority that's essentially, Rand, not a majority. If somebody has a cold, we don't have a majority, right? So we have to get some more Republicans in there, and we're here for some good ones tonight.
On Monday night at the White House, we kept one of the biggest and most historic promises of all. Do you know what we're talking about, right? Never has a man been treated so badly. America watched as we proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. A great, great gentleman.
What happened to him was so unfair. I've never seen anything like it. And we stuck with him all the way because we knew the facts. We stuck with him all the way. And Rand Paul and Mitch, they stuck with him. No doubts about it. No doubts. Remember that. Remember that. He now sits alongside Justice Neil Gorsuch to defend your sacred rights and your God-given freedom.
What the crazy, radical Democrats did to Justice Kavanaugh is a national disgrace. From the moment Brett Kavanaugh was known, well, you know what happened. We announced the name, we nominated him, and literally from the moment he was nominated, they didn't even know. It's actually, if you think of it, it's from before he was nominated, nobody knew anything about who it was going to be. I didn't even make my decision yet, and they started saying horrible things about whoever the person might be. They were on a mission to obstruct, resist, delay, demolish, and destroy.
The Democrats have become totally consumed by their chilling lust for power. And I'll tell you something, we have a man, one of the most powerful men in the world, it's OK, comes from Kentucky, that's not bad. Got to respect that. And he heard about this, he says I want to be there. He's one of yours. He's joining us tonight.
He's rock-ribbed Kentucky leader. He's been a leader for a long time. There's nobody tougher. There's nobody smarter. He refused to cave to the radical Democrats' shameful campaign of political and personal destruction. He stared down, tough cookie -- I know tough people, he's tough, he's Kentucky tough, which is about as tough... He stared down the angry left-wing mob.
He never blinked, and he never looked back, and he got us a man who will be one of our great, great Supreme Court justices, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Come up here.
Thank you, Kentucky. Aren't we proud of President Trump? Let me just add, thanks to President Trump and a Republican Senate, 84 new federal judges already this Congress. That's already a record, Mr. President. Keep sending them our way and we'll keep confirming them and change the court system forever. Thank you for being here.
Thank you. And Mitch is a true fighter for Kentucky. He loves this state. And you know, we'll be running together in 2020. That will be a lot of fun. Thank you, Mitch. On this Election Day, November 6th, every American faces a simple choice. You can either vote for Democrat mob rule or you can vote for a Republican Party that stands proudly for law and order, fairness, freedom, and justice.
Simple as that. If Nancy Pelosi... crying Chuck Schumer, and the radical Democrats take over Congress, they will try to raise your taxes, they will immediately restore job-killing regulations, they will impose, believe it or not, socialism, take away your health care, your health care and your whole life will be unaffordable, shut down immediately, oh, forget this one, shut down your coal mines in about two minutes.
You see what's going on with the Second Amendment? They will destroy your Second Amendment. And the Democrats want to open our borders to a flood of deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. The fact is, Democrats have become the party of crime. They have. Republicans are the party of safety, and we are the party of jobs, jobs, jobs.
And we're thrilled to be joined this evening by several terrific Kentucky Republicans. First of all, Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? Thank you. Congressman Tom Massie. They've got them spread all over the place. Where's Tom? Doing a great job, thank you. They're doing a great job.
Congressman Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Congressman James Comer, James Comer. Thanks, James. James, the whole group, they have been incredible, I'll tell you what. We got tax cuts, biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. We got so many other things. ANWR. We got rid of the individual mandate. We had Obamacare repealed and replaced.
We didn't get one Democrat vote, but we'll get it done. We had a little disappointment that night. A little bit of a disappointment. But it's essentially done anyway, because when you get rid of the mandate, the individual mandate, it's done. And what we have done with the remnants of Obamacare is we've kept your premiums down far below what anybody would have thought, through good management, through Secretary Alex Azar.
Now a friend of mine who has helped us so much, he's really smart, but I have to say his wife, the last couple of days, has become maybe the biggest star in the family. She's been so -- I said, Rand, you have to get her on television more. She's become the biggest star in the family. Yes. A man that really has been a friend of mine, a special friend, and he's really something.
He's a great guy. Not everybody knows that, believe it or not. Not -- it's like Mitch, not everybody knows that Mitch is a great guy. These are great people. There's something that happens to you when you grow up in Kentucky, I guess, right? These are great people. But, you know, I call Rand a senator of tremendous common sense.
That's a great compliment, common sense. And you know what? Hey, Rand, he's young, he's spry, run up here for a second, Rand. Come up here, Rand.
The president said he's tired. I could take 20 or 30 minutes, right? Now, I'm going to tell you a very quick story about the president, and this shows how he's different than any politician and why you're all out here. I went to him with an idea on health care. I said, let's let individuals buy it in a group.
Let them join an association. Let competition drive prices down. The president said, it's a great idea. What did he staff say? Oh, no, we could never do that. What did all the middle managers say? Oh, we could never do that. And you know what the president said? Make it so. And he did it.
But it's true. We were talking about health care and Rand had this concept that -- he was so far advanced, even the experts didn't know, and after they checked, they said, you know, he's right. He's right. Association health care, where you can team up with other companies, you can team up -- you go in, you get phenomenal pricing, you have no problems with crossing borders, so you get every insurance company, and it's taken off, Rand, and that was Rand's initial idea.
That's true. And it's doing really well. Inexpensive and terrific. And another man, a very special friend of mine, he was a great businessman, decided to win and run in Kentucky. By the way, does that sound familiar? This guy was a really successful guy and he saw things happening in Kentucky, and he said, you know, I can do a tremendous job, and he really has done.
And he doesn't want to be political. He wants to get the job done. This state is doing so well. You have your lowest unemployment numbers in history. You have your best incomes in history. You have jobs and companies flowing back in. And all of that wouldn't matter if I didn't like him, because if I didn't like him, I'd say, forget about him, right?
But I like him a lot. He's a terrific man and a terrific governor, Matt Bevin. Thank you, Matt. Thanks, Matt. So we're here for a truly special guy. These are all special people. Something about this place. Boy, did we win by a lot. What did we win by, 38? Thirty-eight. We won by a lot. I have a feeling that Mitch McConnell in two years is going to do very good, very good.
He's going to do very good. You know, he goes down as the greatest leader, in my opinion, in history. What we've done is incredible together. But he's better when I'm president than he ever was when anyone else was president. Doing much better. But I want to introduce the leader that we're all here for tonight.
And all of our congressmen know exactly what I'm talking about. He has been so strong on all of the things that we stand for, tax cuts, regulation cuts. Every single event that we passed, and it's record numbers of events, he's been at the forefront, and he's got a little bit of a tough race with a Nancy Pelosi-picked figure.
And I guess they did a little changing, and they did a lot of this and that, the Democrats do, that's the only way they can win. But I'll tell you what, I've seen the -- you know, outside, you have 25,000, 35,000, some crazy number of people, and we set up movie screens. We set up beautiful movie screens.
And to those people outside, we love you. We love you. You have to see the lines, they go all the way back, many miles. But a lot of them stayed and they're watching screens outside. I like your location better, do you agree? But this is a special guy, and normally I wouldn't make a trip, but here I have two reasons.
One was I love the state of Kentucky. And the other was that Andy Barr is a great congressman. Andy, come on up. [Audience Chants Andy]
Mr. President, welcome to Kentucky's Sixth Congressional District. A swing district that two years ago, you sent a message to the nation because you won it by 15 points. And welcome to Madison County, a county, Mr. President, that you won by a whopping 32 points. Home of Eastern Kentucky University, where we are right now, the most pro-veteran university in America.
Home to workers who relocated from Eastern Kentucky, who value a paycheck to put food on the table, and, Mr. President, thank you for ending the war on coal. And Madison County, home of the Department of Criminal Justice Training, the Kentucky State Police, two awesome police departments, and Democrat Sheriff Mike Coyle, the sheriff of the year, who says, Mr. President, to keep the drugs out of our communities, we need to build the wall.
[Audience Chants Build the Wall] And when I first met you -- when I first met you, Mr. President, I told you about our drug problem in Kentucky, and you listened. And six months later, I was in the White House with you when you declared a national public health emergency to fight the drug epidemic, the opioid epidemic.
And we worked together and we funded the most significant investment to fight a drug crisis in American history. This president is a man of action. A man of action. Other people resist, but this president gets results. And so I want to turn it over to him, but I just want to remember one special night two years ago in Cleveland, the moment I knew this man would be the next president of the United States.
Remember? Remember what he said. He said that my opponent has a slogan, and that slogan is I'm with her. Remember what he said next? What he said was, I have a different slogan, and that slogan is: I'm with you, the American people. Mr. President, I'm with you to fight for the American people!
Thank you. That's pretty good. Now, you know, the one thing that Andy didn't say is that she paid a lot of money for that slogan. And the morning after I came up with my little feel on it, they changed the slogan. It was gone. It was gone. But we weren't gone, because this was the single greatest movement in the history of American politics.
And our slogan was a great slogan. I think it's the greatest slogan that anybody will ever come up with. Although in two years, we have a new one, you know what that is. Ours is make America great again. Look at all these hats. And at the rate we're going, it's going to happen fast, it's called keep America great.
It's got to be that. Right? So I'm here for Andy Barr. And that's a vote for safe communities, strong borders, and Kentucky values. Andy Barr. A vote for Andy's opponent, I had to do a little checking, who's he running against? Who? This is an extreme liberal named Amy McGrath. Chosen by Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, that's a real beauty... and the radical Democrat mob.
Now, Amy supports a socialist takeover of your health care, which by the way means your taxes are going to triple if you're lucky. She supports open borders. She needs the tax hikes to cover the through-the-roof garbage that you want no part of. And she wants to immediately decimate your now-thriving coal industry.
So if you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker of the House -- no, we can't do that. That will not be good. Then you have to get out and vote for Andy Barr, a great man. Great man. You know, actually, I must tell you, Kentucky, you're always involved at the middle of politics. The election of Andy is a very important thing, could make the difference between unbelievable continued success and, frankly, failure, where we fight for two more years with these people, with these obstructionists.
So it's really an important race. It could be the congressman up -- I don't know if they're worried about them. They're so far ahead in their races. We don't have to talk about them anymore, right? We don't have to talk about them. We don't have to talk about them, but we were talking backstage, and they said it. This could be the most important race there is. So get out and vote.
We can't let this happen. A majority of House Democrats have already signed up for socialist health care. By the way, it doesn't work anywhere in the world. Just so you understand. It doesn't work. It's good if you don't mind waiting like five weeks to see a doctor. They come from socialist countries. Frankly, they come from Canada, because they want to use our doctors.
They come from all over the world. And we're making it now better. And they want to destroy everything that's been built, all of that great foundation. They want to outlaw the private insurance plans of 2.4 million Kentucky residents. And some of those plans are fantastic and inexpensive. The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage for nearly 250,000 Kentucky seniors who depend on it. Republicans want to protect Medicare, and we will, for our great seniors who have earned it and who have paid for it. And Republicans only will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
We're going to protect it. The new platform of the Democrat Party is radical socialism and it's open borders. Democrats want to abolish ICE and they want to turn America into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and MS-13 thugs. And don't kid yourself, that's what's going to happen. And they want to get rid of ICE.
They think ICE isn't nice. Did you ever see what they're dealing with? First of all, they're incredible patriots. They have a job that nobody in this group wants. They go in there and they meet the most vile, most vicious people on earth like it's a day at the office. You don't want to do it. You don't want to -- yeah, you might do it. This guy might do it. You want a job?
I'll get it to you with a -- look at this guy, this guy will do it. I'm looking at -- he might do it. You might do it. But you don't want to do it. They go in there and they liberate towns. These people came in by the thousands, and we're taking them out by the thousands. They're getting out. They're getting out.
Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans -- and you know this, you know this -- Republicans stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. You know that. One by one, we are finding the illegal alien criminals, predators, drug dealers, MS-13 killers, and we are sending them back home.
We are liberating America's cities and towns. That's what we're doing. The only immigration policy Democrats support is catch and release. How about that one? You catch a criminal thug, you take their name, and then you release them, say please show up in five years to court. Now, number one, it's ridiculous.
Number two, they never show up. What a mess. We have the dumbest immigration laws in the world. The world laughs at us, but we're getting them changed. We need some more Republicans. We need some votes. And if you elect Republicans this November, we will pass legislation to end catch and release. We will -- I'll tell you, have you heard the other one?
Right? Lottery. Lottery. Lottery. OK? Names, you pick them out, coming to the United States. Now, let me ask you, these countries set up lotteries. Do you really believe they're giving us their finest? No. This is a lottery. This was Chuck Schumer's special deal for this country. And we need to elect people so we get rid of it. We got -- maybe just get rid of it. How crazy.
How crazy. How -- and then you have chain migration. You know what that is, right? So we had a man, horrible person, the west side in Manhattan, where I live, where I love, right along the Hudson River. He's driving a car down this roadway where the speed limit is 35. He's going about 70. And he decides to make a right turn into a beautiful park that goes along the river with lots of people.
Many people were killed. Nobody ever talks about the people that were horribly injured. They lost legs, they lost arms. These are people that were running. They want to keep themselves in shape. They were working out. They were walking hand-in-hand together. They're dead. They're horribly wounded. Many will never, ever recover.
Now, what happens? What happened to him? It will be years of litigation. He came in, and then he took chain migration, and he brought his mother, and his father, and his brother, and his sister, and his aunt, and his grandfather. None of them working. It ended up being approximately 22 people who came in. It's called a chain.
Isn't that wonderful? A chain. And we're stuck with them. We're stuck with these people. And I don't want a chain. I want people to come into our country on a merit-based system. And I want them to help all of the great companies that are moving back into the United States. They're moving to Michigan, they're moving to Ohio, they're moving to Pennsylvania, they're moving to North and South Carolina.
They're coming in. They're moving to Florida. And, yes, they're moving into Kentucky. And with what we've done, we've become so successful that we need people to come in with all these companies that are coming in. But we want great people that love our country, that respect our country, and that want to work.
This election is about safety and it is about prosperity. Since the last election -- and these are numbers that the fakers back there, the fake news, would never have allowed me to say. They'd never in a million years, if I ever said this during the campaign, they would've had headlines. We've created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps.
You know what that means? The second, food stamps. It means, number one, we get rid of an unbelievable cost. You wouldn't even believe it. But you know what else? You got a lot of happy people that are working. It's a great thing. It's a great thing. We've added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember, manufacturing's never going to come back?
Never going to come back, remember? The previous administration, oh, you think that's going to happen? You'd need a magic wand. Well, I guess we had the magic wand. We had the magic wand. And these are great jobs and these are important jobs. Manufacturing jobs, companies pouring back in. Manufacturing. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded in history.
African-American poverty has reached its lowest level in history. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in history. I can't believe I'm still saying this. I am so sorry, I apologize to the women in the room. Remember, I got 52 percent -- remember, they kept saying, he's not -- the fake news -- that's right.
Remember he said -- they were all saying he will not do well with women? Wow, did we do well with women. Did we do well. Fake news. We did really well with women. But, unfortunately, the women's unemployment, Mitch, is not at a historic low. It's only the best number in 65 years. We let down women. We let down women.
Sixty-five years, 3.6 percent. As the charts grow just a little bit, it will be historic very soon. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning. You know about winning. You really know about winning. Those horses win. You people are winners. I'm just afraid that Kentucky is winning too much.
[Audience calls out No] You're going to send Matt Bevin to see Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, and they're going to all come to the Oval Office to see me, and they're going to say, Mr. President, we can't do it anymore. Kentucky is winning too much. They can't do it. They don't like it. They don't want to do it anymore.
They're going to say, we're winning so much, we just can't stand it. I'm going to say, Mitch and Matt and Rand, I'm sorry. We're going to keep winning. We're going to win more and more and more. We're going to keep winning. I'm sorry, folks. And I will send them happily back to Kentucky. You're winning a lot.
We won today. We won today with the great pastor, Pastor Brunson. Last week, I announced that we are replacing the horror show, one of the worst trade deals ever made, known as NAFTA, with an incredible, brand-new U.S. Mexico-Canada agreement called the USMCA, USMCA. And even the Democrats are saying, wow, what a good deal that is. They can't believe it. We actually, Mitch, get bipartisan support.
Can you believe it? Although, if it's too good, they won't support it. That's the problem. No, I will say, even Chuck Schumer liked it. Can you believe that one? He said that's a good deal. We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices. China -- and I have great respect for China, we all do, and I have great respect and like him for President Xi, the absolute head -- this is an absolute head of China.
But you know what? They've been making $300 billion to $500 billion a year, taking it out of our country. We have rebuilt China. And I don't blame China. They can get away -- I blame our past leaders, because they should never have let it happen. I don't blame China. And thanks to our strong trade and economic policies, Brady Industries recently broke ground on a new billion-dollar aluminum mill that will create up to 1,500 jobs right next to Ashland, Kentucky.
You know where we're talking about, right? Right? Ashland. Under Republican leadership, we also passed the biggest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country. Bigger than any have ever been passed. We have taken historic action to reduce the price of prescription drugs. You saw three weeks ago, Pfizer, Novartis, a lot of drug companies announced a very substantial increase.
Then I said to Secretary Alex Ocasa -- and I said to Alex Azar, this is no good. This is no good. We got to do something. I want to call them. And I called the head of Pfizer, big company -- I guess like the biggest -- big, big drug company. I called Novartis. I called the heads of these companies, and they said, sir, sir, we will immediately drop the price back to where it was.
Did you ever hear of that? And Rand Paul, it's the first time I realized how powerful it was to be the president of the United States. No, they -- they reduced -- now, I -- and by the way, I kid, but I do, I respect that they did that. I really appreciate it. And now because of what Secretary Azar is doing, you're going to see drug pricing, prescription drugs going down.
You know, we have countries -- we have countries on this planet, the exact same pill, the exact same prescription, made in the exact same factory or plant, in Canada and in other countries all over the world, is much less, sometimes 50 percent, sometimes more than that, it's much less than what Americans pay.
We're getting rid of the middleman. We're doing a number -- I'm going to be hated so much by some people in this country that made a fortune. But we're getting drug prices way down. And we started it last Friday with the signing of two bills. And something that the congressman really helped me with, all of them in the room and Andy, in particular, we help right now get critically ill, terminal patients access to life-saving treatments.
We just passed right to try. Right to try. I hope nobody has to use it in this room. But this is a person who's terminally ill -- we have the greatest drug companies and the greatest research in the world by far, nobody close. But we have a pipeline that would take 12 to 15 years to get it approved and through the pipeline.
We have that down, I think, to four years and maybe less, but we have to be careful. But if we had something that really showed great promise toward a problem that somebody had, who's terminally ill, for 44 years, they've been trying to get this passed. They couldn't. Not as easy as it sounds. Between the insurance companies, the liabilities, the country itself, the lawsuits.
So I got everybody in a room, we got to get life -- this is really important stuff. Excuse me, how many of you know friends? If they have money, they travel all over the world, begging and looking for a cure. They want hope. If they don't have money, they go home, they have no hope. And we got right to try passed a month-and-a-half ago and already it's had an incredible impact.
Incredible impact, 44 years. So now a patient is terminally ill, we have something that's looking really good, we make them sign a document, very important document, and they go in and we work with them and we see if we can help them. And we've had some incredible results already. So I just want to thank Andy Barr and all of the congressmen here and Mitch and Rand, because we got it passed.
We got it passed. But to me that was a big thing. Many, many, many years they worked on it, they couldn't get it done. We also passed veterans' choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor instead of waiting online for 12 days, for 24 days, for 38 days. We have our great veterans -- we're doing a great job with our veterans -- we have our -- but this was one of the most important things -- because they'd be waiting in line for sometimes months if you can believe it. We had people waiting in line and they weren't very sick.
By the time they saw a doctor, they were terminally ill. Now, if there's a line, if there's a way, because we have great doctors in the V.A. That's one thing we -- I'll tell you, everybody tells me. You can't get to them. Now, if there's a wait, you go to a local doctor, you get yourself taken care of, and we pay for the bill.
We pay for the bill. That was another one. That was another one. Took over 40 years. I used to say to people, why don't we do that? I thought I was so smart. I said, listen, I got a great idea. These lines are terrible, 28 days, 30 days. I got a great idea. It's the greatest idea I think I've ever had. We're going to have them go to a private doctor instead of waiting on line.
Sir, we've been trying to get that passed for 40 years. Oh, you've heard about it before? Everybody heard -- they couldn't get it passed. But we're going at getting things passed. We got it passed. Rand and Mitch and Andy, we got it passed. And the landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable.
Jim, you mistreated our veteran, Jim. Jim, you're fired, get out. We just secured $700 billion and $716 billion, two years, to fully rebuild the American military. Bigger, stronger, more powerful than ever before, and we are giving our warriors their largest pay raise in over a decade. And at my direction -- and we need Rand and we need Mitch's help, but it's really popular -- let them know how popular this is -- you know, it's all about space.
It's all about space. Defense, offense, everything, it's going to soon be all about space. So let Rand and Mitch know about this. Ready? At my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces known as the Space Force. Now they have to do it. I put them on the spot.
I put them on the spot. Now, they have to do it. No, it's very popular. One of the biggest applause I get wherever I go is when I talk about the Space Force. And, by the way, China, already started. Russia, already started. They've got to start, but we have the greatest people in the world. We make the greatest equipment in the world.
We make the greatest rockets and missiles and tanks and ships in the world. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. You know, when I came to office, weeks before I was given rundowns of what's happening, and Iran was just a question of when will they take over the entire Middle East?
They're not thinking about that anymore, folks. They're not thinking about it anymore. They've got a little disaster going. They have riots in the street. Their currency is shot. And they'll be coming to us some day, probably not too far out, and they'll say we'd like to make a deal. And that's fine. That's good.
But a real deal. Not the joke of a deal that was made by the past administration. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Right? Together we have made extraordinary progress, but we're just getting started. If you vote to elect Republican House and Republican Senate, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and raise your incomes very, very substantially.
We, unlike the Democrats, will protect Medicare and protect Social Security. Remember what I said during the debates? We will protect them. We will defend your Second Amendment and protect your right to free speech and religious liberty. With your help, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, and all of the people that work so well with us will continue to confirm incredible pro-Constitution judges, not radical far-left judges who will rewrite your Constitution and replace your Kentucky values.
Not going to happen. Eighty-four judges -- think of that, it's a record -- it's a record -- and we actually have a lot to go, 84 judges approved. What a difference. Going to be, by the time we finish, maybe 50 percent of the court. Do you know what that is? Fifty percent. We will fully secure the border.
We will pass Kate's law, stop sanctuary cities, end the visa lottery, end chain migration, and we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists the hell out of our country. We will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.
But to achieve this future, to continue the greatest movement in the history of our country and maybe of any country, you need to vote Republican. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for the great people of Kentucky.
And we are proudly standing up for our national anthem. On November 6th, I need you to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote for Andy Barr. Great man. A vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs, more wealth, and more products made right here in the good, old USA.
It's about to respect our laws and to respect the heroes of law enforcement. They are heroes. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of hatred, anger, and division, and to celebrate the greatness and the glory of being an American. It is not up to the media, it's not up to the pundits, it's up to you to decide your own fate.
You have the power with your vote to defend your family, defend your country, defend your values, your faith, and to defend your dignity. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together, we are taking back our country, returning power to the American people. This great state was settled by really -- I mean, how tough, how smart -- by tough, tough men and even tougher women, by the way.
But it was settled by tough men, pioneer women who braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God.
These courageous Kentucky patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage. For the sake of our freedom, and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win.
We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to glorious victory, because we are American, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Vote for Andy Barr.
Wow. Thank you. Thank you, New Mexico. Thank you. We love being with you, we love being with credible people, credible people. Thank you very much and I'm thrilled to be here in Albuquerque, with thousands of hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots. Incredible. Thank you. We're all united by the same love of our great country, and by the way, our country is doing great.
You see it. The same devotion to family and the same profound faith that America is blessed by the eternal grace of Almighty God. [Audience Boos, Chants "USA"] Goodnight to that person. Tomorrow, they'll say massive protest. Now one person just going home to mommy a little bit sooner. Good night. But we're bound by these convictions.
We will campaign for every vote and we will win the great state of New Mexico in 2020. And by the way, you have thousands and thousands of people outside who can't get in. So we love you, we love you, we appreciate it. We try to get the biggest arena we can get and they're never big enough, frankly, so there's something going on. You know I always say, 2016, I don't know if there'll be another 2016, but right now it's like a great tree or a great plant.
You plant it and it has to take hold. We have to win 2020, we're doing so well, we have to win 2020. And every day, and you know as well as I do, we're battling against the corrupt establishment of the past and we're achieving historic victories for the American people We're winning again, we're winning again, and we're winning big, we're winning big.
Crucially, for your state, we have ended the last administration's war on American energy,. And since by election, natural gas production, big story today, in New Mexico has increased by 40%, four O. And that means, great wages and it means jobs and that's why you're breaking every single record in your state's book.
Crude oil production in New Mexico has more than doubled and going up a lot higher very quickly. On your state's energy revenues are up by nearly two thirds, think of that, two thirds and that's in a short period of time, OK. Give me a little bit more time, OK? [Crowd Chants "Four More Years"] The United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.
This means more jobs, higher wages and American energy independence, which is what we have. You know a few years ago, we had a problem, like you saw two days ago in the Middle East, we would have been in a panic, although not if I were your president, we never panic. We don't want to panic, but a few years ago they would have been in a panic.
Today we had a lot of oil. We got a lot of gas. A lot of oil and gas. We don't have to send too many boats over there. You notice the other day. They were saying, We don't see too many American ships anymore. You know why? Because we don't need we're independent as independent as we want, and we are now a net exporter of energy.
Revenues from energy production provide up to 25% of your state's budget and going much higher in the very near future and they've generated nearly a billion-dollar budget surplus in New Mexico. Thank you very much, President Trump. Thank you. Now, under the Green New Deal that all goes away, that all goes away.
It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cowers, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car, make it electric, single car, you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles. They'll call us the hermit nation, we'll never leave our house. Now it's crazy, but that's OK. I don't want to bring it up because I don't want to do it too early, maybe they'll change.
I don't want it to change, but think of it, for you and for Texas and for so many other places, they want to get rid of your energy. I mean explain that one, explain that. Yet every major Democrat running for president, they want to abolish your production of oil and natural gas. In other words, the Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexico's economy.
The Democrats want us to be subservient to foreign producers. They want us to be at the mercy of rogue regimes. That's not happening anymore. It's been a long time. It's been a long time. It's not happening anymore, but Democrats will never get the chance, because New Mexico will never give them that chance.
[Audience chants "USA"] Under this administration, America is working again, America is winning again, and America is respected again, like it hasn't been for a long time. And I can tell you because I meet so many of the leaders and their presidents and their kings and queens, and the prime ministers, and their everything.
Dictators, every once in a while, every once in a while, you get a rogue dictator and I'll tell you they always start off. Today I had the crown prince of Bahrain and they come in and they say, Sir, I'd like to congratulate you on what you've done with the economy of the United States. It's a model for the entire world.
They all say it. And earlier today -- Do we have any baseball fans right, right? You know what I'm saying, but earlier today in the White House, I had the honor of awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom. That's the highest civilian award to someone who truly embodies the American dream. Baseball legend, the greatest by the way, the greatest relief pitcher of all time, you look at those records, Mariano Rivera.
He was something. The Yankees won a lot of World Series because of Mariano, a great guy. We gave him the medal. Done so much for charity. A fantastic man, fantastic family. It was a beautiful day at the White House, so it was good. My administration is fighting to empower all Americans to reach their dreams and achieve their potential.
We have created six million new jobs since Election Day. The fake news would never have allowed us to say that during the campaign, even as a projection. Unemployment recently reached its lowest rate, in over 50 years. More than 7 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Nearly 600,000 Americans came into the labor force last month alone, think of that.
Wages in your state, New Mexico are growing at a rate of much more than 3% a year, which is unheard of 20 years ago, and I used to say during the campaign, you go back it's hard to believe, I'm here almost three years. Can you believe our time is flying? Can you believe? I don't know about me, but you look so much better than you did three years ago.
You're wealthier and even with the Me Too movement. We can't say this, but I'll say it anyway, you're better looking, including the men, including the men, now you're, all looking good. Since my election, the number of new business applications for New Mexico has increased by almost 30%, more than any state in the United States.
Think of that. More than any state in the United States. So essentially, that saying you're in a certain category, which is a very important category, you're doing better than any state in the United States. How do I lose New Mexico? Explain that one, right? How do we lose that one? No. And yet, for whatever reason, it's been quite a while since the Republican won this state, but we're going to win the state.
I think we're going to win the state easily. Yet to see the people all the way in from the airport That was a long drive by the way, 35 minutes. That was a long drive, but all the way in we had people and they were waving and I didn't see any negative hand gesture, right. No, I think we're going to do great here and we're here for a number of reasons, but we're here, because we really think we're going to turn this state and make it a Republican state.
Yesterday marked the beginning of the Hispanic Heritage Month. Who's Hispanic here? Latinos for Trump, thank you. Incredible people. But we have much to celebrate unbelievable when you think the unemployment for Hispanic Americans is, right now, at the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country.
Hispanic-American poverty reached a brand new all-time low in history. And after years of stagnation, that you know very well, wages for Hispanic Americans are rising really fast, up nearly 8% since my election. Those are unheard of numbers, believe me. And median income, think of that, median income for Hispanic Americans surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever.
That's your median, that's not bad. That means you're wealthy and you're getting wealthier fast. I just want to tell you it's an honor. But you know, when I'm on the debate stage, debating one of these far-left radical Democrats, whoever it may be, and they start telling you what they're going to do for you and you say, but we have the best numbers every category that we've ever had Hispanic Americans, excuse me, New Mexico as a whole.
We have the best numbers. African-Americans, the best numbers that we've ever had in the history of our country. Asian-Americans, the best numbers that we've ever had in history. Women, the best numbers that we've had in 71 years. we're working night and day to deliver a future of limitless Opportunity for our nation's Hispanic American citizens, including millions and millions of extraordinary Mexican Americans who enrich our society and strengthen our country, serve in our military and contribute immensely to our shared American family.
And I want to just tell you that Mexico is doing a great job for us on the border and I want to thank the president of Mexico. And that's very interesting, I hear everybody screaming. Well, you know we're building the wall and it's going up and it's going [Inaudible] And if you think that's easy with the Democrats, who control the House, we have to take it back, but if you think it's easy -- but we're building a lot of wall.
We'll have almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year and it's making a big difference. Five hundred miles. But you know we want a big case two months ago, in the Supreme Court that allowed us to do what we're doing. This has been -- I'll tell you what. Ready? Another president would have given up a long time ago.
We don't give up. So we're building the wall. The Army Corps of Engineers would do it a beautiful job. It's a great -- it's a great structure, great structure. You're going to have to really want to get over that wall to do it, but you know it was very interesting because not too long ago, I saw where the Hispanic American, the Hispanics were up with me in A poll 17% and everyone said how is that?
How was that 17%? Up by 17? I won't even tell you what the final number was, because they won't believe it, but you're going to see what the final number. But you know why? Because the Hispanic Americans, they understand, they don't want criminals coming across the border, they don't want people taking their jobs, they want to have that security and they want the wall.
They want the wall. And we have a man in the audience. Who is, I think, the best dressed man in this entire place, including me right here. Look at him. Come in. Look at him. Look at this guy and he's been to a couple rallies to haven't you, huh? We have some people, a group of people the other day -- You know we had a victory in North Carolina that was unbelievable, two of them.
One of them was going to be very, very close, he's another one of my friends. Thank you. I like that beautiful red tie you're wearing. But we had a victory. Two victories, North Carolina, where one was 17 points down three weeks ago we got involved. We started sending out lots of different social media messages.
We did a couple of little robo calls, but the big thing we did a speech the night before the turnout was beyond belief and instead of being down by 17 points, he easily won the election 4 or 5,000 votes. Dan. Thank you, Dan. Thank you, Dan Bishop. And Greg Murphy was up a couple of points and he ended up winning.
I don't not ask the media, but they won't give me -- How many -- What did he get? You know like 20, 21. He won by a lot. He won by a lot. I'd ask that, but we're not going to get a straight answer. They were not happy. I'll tell you, Tuesday night, the fake news was not happy. You know they had their studios all built.
CNN had their A-list talent, they don't have A-list talent, but they had the best they could. And they were all set, This was going to be the end of Trump because this man was going to lose, but he turned out to be tough and smart. And in all fairness I helped a lot to and toward the end of the night they started dismantling that studio, probably would have been there for four weeks.
This is the end, but we had two great victories congressional victories on Tuesday night, and it was something that one gentleman won by a number that nobody thought even possible, so much, and the other one a race that he was way, way, way back. In fact, I shouldn't tell you this, but my genius is my people, some of those people standing right there.
Right there. Some of them right there. They said, Sir, don't get involved in that race, sir. You can't come back from 17 points, sir. It's too much, I said, But you know I really like the guy. I think he's great. Let's give it a shot, they say, Sir, if you lose, they will never ever it'll be much worse. I said, let me tell you, I know them very well.
Whether I helped him or don't help him it's going to be the same. It's going to be a disaster, so let's help them. And we campaigned and we worked hard, right? They said, don't do it, sir. Don't do it, please don't do it, sir it'll be very embarrassing. I said, No, I don't mind being embarrassed. I don't mind being embarrassed.
We're also very proud that unemployment among Native Americans has reached the lowest rate in nearly two decades. And we're building an amazing future for citizens of every background race, religion, color, and creed. And that's what we have, that's what we have: race, religion, color, and creed. But the radical left Democrats want to demolish everything that we've gained.
They want to raise your taxes, they want to bury you in regulation. They want to take away your health insurance, 180 million Americans. They want to erase American history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology, and left-wing Democrats want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your God given right to self-defense.
You know that. As your president, I will never allow them to take away your liberty, your dignity, your Social Security, and I will never ever allow them to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms. The Left tries to threaten bully, intimidate Americans into submission. They use Democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can they'll do whatever they can to demean you, to libel you.
You they try to blacklist coerce, cancel or destroy anyone who gets in their way. Look at what they're doing today to Justice Kavanaugh. Look at what they're doing. Did you see the New York Times? Did you see what they're doing? Did you see what Democrats -- They're calling for his resignation, they're calling for his impeachment.
And the woman involved said she didn't know anything she does, but they still -- So the New York Times had to put out a major apology and they had to change their story. The woman said, I don't remember that. Can you believe? And they still want him to be impeached. And I just put out a statement, and he's a great man by the way, great talent, a great brilliant man, Brett Kavanaugh.
And I just put out a statement on social media. That said, I don't think they'll do it, but they should for the good of the nation. I call for the resignation of everybody at The New York Times involved in the Cabinet Office [Inaudible] , and while you're at it, the Russian witch hunt hoax, which is just as phony as story.
They've taken the old gray lady. You know the New York Times for years, the old gray ladies, so prestigious. They've, taken the old great lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue, and ruined her reputation. She can never recover and will never return to greatness under current management. The Times is dead.
Long live the New York Times, long live the New York Times. And I do want it to live, but they have to be -- they have to change their ways. Think of it, they wrote a story about somebody that said she doesn't remember this. Can you even believe it. And yet all of these radical left crazies are in Judiciary Committee and all of these committees that is set up to hurt the country with all that we have going with Saudi Arabia, with, Iran, with China.
Trade deal with Russia with North Korea, with all that we have gone, and look at the cards that we've been dealt. Lucky, we won the election in 2016. Believe me. With all that we have going, they say, let's impeach Justice Kavanaugh, one of the smartest, most brilliant students, top at Yale, incredible life, incredible family, Let's impeach him, it's a made up story.
Let's impeach, President Trump. Think of that. The Muller report came out. Think of this. This crazy Muller report comes out, 18 Trump haters, liberal Democrats, some work for Hillary Clinton. They found nothing. No, think of it. After two years, they found nothing, they spent $40 million, there's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that.
They spent -- think of it. They found nothing, no collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. To stop the far lefts' campaign of destruction, you must vote Republican and you're going to get the chance very soon. We're joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders and somebody that's done an incredible job.
She ran Michigan for me and, as you know, for the presidential races Michigan had been one in decades and she kept saying, Could you come back, sir? I didn't know who she was. I said, Who the heck is the woman in Michigan that keeps asking? She said, Sir, you keep coming back, you got to win Michigan. Has it been one in decades, and I won Michigan.
Remember that great, great [Inaudible] Great, great night. Donald Trump has won the great state of Michigan and they were going crazy on television. They were going. That was not a good night for certain people. Remember the -- the couple of people that were crying? I guess they don't like a strong military, they don't like cutting regulations, they don't like low taxes.
They don't like right to try. You know right to try? All these things we've done. For the vets, we got Choice. We got Choice for the vets. Choice. Everybody said it was impossible. We've rebuilt, our military. I told this story for the first time today. A general came into my office and my first few weeks you remember it was a little dangerous out there.
President Obama left us with a few beauties, right. And I said to this general, You better be prepared, because this is looking like it could really be conflict and he looked at me and he goes, Sir, we have very little ammunition. I said, Say it again. And I want to tell you the words very little he didn't use because he was less than that.
And I said, I never want to see a president in a position like that, where we may have conflict and a general looks at him and said we have very little, slash, no ammunition. I never want a president of the United States to be in that position and since then, three years, $700 billion we've spent, then $716 billion, and now $738 billion and our military is by far the greatest in the world.
There's nobody that even comes to it. [Audience Chants "USA"] So anyway, no president should ever be put in that position. And by the way, no president should ever have to go through what I've gone through either. That should never happen. What happened is a disgrace to our country. No president should ever have to go through and I'll tell you what, 99% of them would never have been able to take it. They wouldn't have been able to take it, but we won the great state of Michigan and now we're doing really well, because we've moved a lot of car companies.
I tell Japan, sorry big deficits with all these countries, we're changing it, but you got to get car companies we're building car companies now in Michigan they're not going to be leaving for lots of other countries, including China, including Mexico, they're, going to stay home and they're going to pay you a lot of money and everybody's going to be happy, but Michigan is doing great and Ronna McDaniel was the Republican Party Chair of Michigan.
So when we won the election, I said, Let's get the woman from Michigan to run the RNC and she has done an incredible job. Thank you Ronna. A great gentleman who loves the Republican Party co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. Tommy. What a job. New Mexico Republican Party Chairman, Steve Pearce. My friend, and a really talented guy.
He just gets a hell knocked out of him all the time. Brad Parscale, what a job he's doing. Brad. Great job, Brad. Great job. And another great friend of mine, somebody that was on CNN and they didn't like him because he was too positive on Trump. Can you believe it? He happens to be Hispanic, he happens to be Hispanic, but I've never quite figured it out because he looks more like a wasp than I do. So I haven't figured that one out, but I'll tell you what, there is nobody that loves his country more or Hispanic more than Steve Cortez.
Steve. Thank you, Steve. Nobody loves the Hispanics more. Who do you like more the country or the Hispanics? He says the country, I don't know. I -- I may have to go for the Hispanics to be honest with you. We got a lot of Hispanics, we love our Hispanics, get out and vote. You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%. They gave me the Bay of Pigs award.
Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award. And the Venezuelans and the Cubans are all for Trump. I will tell you that. They're all for Trump, they like what we're doing. With the help of -- and Steve I want to thank you very much, by the way, and you were incredible on CNN and now you'll get a real job, OK? Steve, that audience wasn't big enough for you.
Their ratings aren't good. With the help of everyone here tonight. We're taking power out of Washington and giving it back to the great people of our country and to the people of New Mexico. We've got a record number of job-killing regulations, saving the average American household $3,000. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history, and what that means is a typical family of four in New Mexico, making $75,000 dollars has seen their tax bill reduced by more than $2,000. And it's one of the reasons that as the world is not doing great, you look at Europe and you look at Asia and China is not doing too well.
I must be honest with you. Worst year in 57 years I'd say, that's not good, but I hope they still like me. And we've taken in tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs and we've given those tariffs -- and by the way, China's eating the tariffs that devalue their currency. The prices are very similar and they're eating the tariffs.
And out of the tens of billions, we gave our great farmers because they were targeted by China, because China knows, very smart that the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers. I said to our - I said to our secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, I said, Sonny, how much did the farmers get hit by -- by China targeting them and pulling back and doing all sorts of things?
He said, $16 billion. I said, That's OK, we'll take $16 billion out of a much, much, much larger number. We're going to give it to the farmers, so that they're even and I tell you, the farmers do love Trump. They do love Trump. And to keep New Mexico's farms. Ranches and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm on your ranch to your children.
If you don't, like your children, don't do it, but when it's your time to kick the bucket, you worked hard, you have great kids, you love your kids, they've taken care of you. You really love them. It's a great thing, if you don't love them, don't even listen to the last line because it won't matter, don't leave it to them.
If they're not good, leave it to charity, Leave it to something else, don't do it. I know a guy, can't stand his children, they're horrible, horrible human beings, they're a little older now, but they're horrible human beings. He wants to leave his wealth. They said, Why would you leave that, they don't even like you?
But on the assumption that you love your children, you'll be able to use small farms and your ranches and things you'll be able to leave them to your children. Your children won't have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax. They won't be losing it to the banks. Five years later, we got rid of it. That's a big deal.
Thank you. Thank you. Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker, pro jobs, pro family, pro growth, and 100% pro-American. For many decades our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests. You know that. In New Mexico, you know exactly what I'm talking about. People came in, they took your jobs, they had no border, they had no border control.
Look -- look at what's going on now. How we're doing, I mean, honestly, I mentioned the president of Mexico. We have today 27,000 Mexican soldiers on the border, protecting our country and I'll take it. Because our laws are so bad, they're so pathetic, and the Democrats could change these laws. They could change him so quickly.
We could change them all in less than an hour. We could do -- whether it's asylum, whether it's -- any of the laws. We have so many of them that are so bad -- how they got that it took years and years to end up, but we have the Mexican soldiers out there. You see him and they're stopping people. They're numbers are plummeting down, so I just want to thank all of the representatives of Mexico.
Amazing. But we've got to get rid of the loopholes. You know, the word is loopholes and the Democrats could do it fast, but in the meantime, we're doing really well. And as the wall goes up, it becomes less and less of a problem because as the wall gets up, people aren't getting through. I mean, you got to be a a world-class pole vaulter or a world-class Mt. Everest type climber, there's one not too many around like that.
It's really doing the trick. The failed liberal establishment in Washington squandered your tax dollars, shipped away your jobs, sacrifice your sovereignty, and bogged us down in one foreign war debacle, call it whatever you want, after another and that's changing also, you see what's happening. And when these rich countries think we're going to pay for their military every year, billions and billions and billions and they're rich, and they take our business and we're supposed to on top of everything else, I could tell you stories, but I'm going to save them for the campaign, you know, because to be honest, this is a little earlier than the campaign.
Later this campaign starts. You know, like, I was telling Brad and I was telling a few of the folks, One thing I don't want to do -- Michael back there. Michael, hello, my, what a job he's done. But I'm telling them. I don't want to do this too early. I don't want to do it. You know the Pocahontas thing, I did that, it was before his time.
Right? It was before his time. Too early. One thousand twenty four. That means, I have more Indian blood than she does and I have none. Unfortunately, I'd like to say I have a lot. Either get me another 4%, maybe another 10%, but I was early with her and frankly, oh, it's coming back, don't worry about it. But those days are over under this administration.
We are finally putting America first. Putting it first. [Audience Chants "USA"] We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that ravished our industries and devastated communities all across our land. You see the factories, empty buildings, empty hulks, some have been demolished, some have been reek, inverted into senior citizen housing and housing, but all those jobs are gone and we're bringing them back.
They're coming back like almost never before, probably, I can say they're coming back, like never before. People are coming back now because they want to be where the action is, and this is the country where they have the security and where they do have the action. In my first week in office, I proudly withdrew.
From the last administration's job destroying cap -- and this was a catastrophe. You know the Trans-Pacific Partnership? TPP. This would have destroyed the automobile business in our country. Now, New Mexico, you know that you were totally devastated by another disaster, known as NAFTA. Your state lost 33% of its manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed.
This was one of the great catastrophes and now we're replacing NAFTA with the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA, Think of the song YMCA, YMCA, think of the song, USMCA. That's U.S-Mexico-Canada Agreement and it's drawing strong bipartisan support from all across your State and all across the country, it's amazing.
I want to just -- yeah. The Doa Ana county Board of Commissioners' all Democrats, just unanimously endorsed the USMCA and urged Congress to pass it immediately. Thank you very much, commissioners. All Democrats. Hopefully, they'll put it up for a vote. Nancy Pelosi, they put it up for a vote. It's going to be very popular, but Republicans love it and the Democrats love it. And frankly, Labor loves, it. Unions, love it. Farmers, love, love, love it and everybody wants it, your farmers, your ranchers, everybody wants it. It's an incredible agreement and Mexico's already passed it and Canada is ready to pass it soon as we do. See, they don't, maybe, trust us, that's why.
As I warn you passing it now, they say, oh we'll pass it, they're going to pass it as soon as we do. Past leaders invited China to freely loot and pillage the United States economy. China has been taking out, from 300 billion to $500 billion a year, billion, not million, billion. Think of what $500 billion is. We've rebuilt China, but now it's a different ballgame somebody had to do something with China.
President Obama should have done it. Presidents Bush should have done it. President Clinton should have done it. They all should have done it. Frankly, they all should have done a lot of things that we're doing right now. So if you look at it, nobody did it. So I'm doing it and that's what's going to happen, we're doing well.
So now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from China, when in the past we never got 10 cents, we never got money, we never got anything. You know we got unemployment and losses and some G pencils more than we needed. You could do with one less pencil. Following decades of outsourcing and offshoring.
Our jobs and factories and coming back home where they belong. If foreign companies do not want to pay our tariffs, there is one very simple solution come and make your product in America come and make your product in New Mexico. And by the way, I'm just seeing this great group of people. The spirit -- Is there any place in the world that's more fun or more exciting than a Trump rally?
Really. When you think about it, it's not about fun. It's about achievement, because what we've achieved in the last almost three years is unparalleled. There's never been an administration that in the first two-and-a-half years has done what we've been able to do or achieve. In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible.
Federal judges, including court of appeals, judges, because President Obama did us a great favor when I came in, I said, I assume I have no judges to appoint. No sir, you have 138 judges. 138, didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138. Now we're up to 180. I just signed my 150th federal judge and court of appeals judge, and we already have two great Supreme Court justices, lawsuits and cabinet.
Great, great men. So think of that. You know you come in, and I've always heard the most important thing. A president does. I disagree with this by the way, but that's OK. I disagree with a lot of things because I think the most important thing is our military and protecting our country, right? But if you listen to the so-called Washington elite -- Now why are they elite?
We do better than they do we're smarter than them. We make more money, we have better houses, we have better everything and then they say the elite. That means you're the super elite. I have always taken offense when somebody said, President Trump is tired of listening to the elite. I said no, no, I'm more elite than them.
I mean, If we go by the old standards, our better houses, better schools, made much more money, lived better, had everything going and then I decide to run for president and I'll be -- I'll be honest. Well, we have to put up with these people, and others are -- that's incredible, but it's the greatest, single decision I've ever made because our country is turning around so rapidly.
I could not be happier despite what they put us all through. After years of building up other countries we're finally building up our country. Isn't that nice? It's time to finally take care of our own and we're also aggressively combating the opioid epidemic, which is horrible and as a result of our nonstop efforts and billions and billions of dollars invested, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades, 30 years.
And at the center of America's drug crisis, this is where the Hispanics know it better than anybody. People said, Oh, the Hispanics won't like a world. I said, I think they're going to love it. They won't like border security. I think they're going to love it. You know why, because you understand it better than other people, but at the whole center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in, and you understand that when other people don't understand it. The border crisis, every day dangerous criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal Narcotics across your southern border, including heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl, and we're stopping them now.
You see the kind of numbers we're getting, millions and millions and millions of dollars worth we've had some shipments that could kill half of the country. Some of the fentanyl and some of the bad, really bad stuff if it were distributed could actually has the power to kill half of the country. This is like a war-like situation.
That's why you're liking Trump, because you're not going to let that happen. If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic? And they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, its women. They're not trafficking in men, they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don't go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else.
They go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in. But now when you have a wall, they can't do that right? Can't do that. And so many of these Democrats that are against what's common sense. Look. You know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention.
They just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it's for? They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall, a massive wall. We should tell them open borders, let everybody come in. And a few years ago, almost every one of these they're on tape. That's the problem with politics.
Three years, they could say, Look. I saw Senator Schumer, I saw Nancy Pelosi, I saw all of them, they said, No, we need a wall, we must have a wall, we must have President Obama, we must have a wall, we must stop people from coming into our country illegally, we have to stop it. We need a wall now, a few leaders later they don't want a wall.
You know why? because anything I want, they want to do the opposite and that's OK, that's the only reason. But if you want to stop the drug smugglers, human traffickers and vicious MS-3 gang members, which we're taking out every year by the thousands and getting them The hell out of our country, because of ICE.
and if you want to stop all these people from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth, you know it's poisoning. Are you that's what it is? It's nothing other than that. It's very simple, they're poisoning our youth. You have only one choice, you must elect Republicans. And to be honest with you, you've got to elect President Trump.
We need four more years. President Trump. [Audience Chants "Four More Years"] How about these phony Democrats? They started with Russia, Russia, Russia, that turned out to be a fraud, that turned out to be a fraud. Then they went to race. They believe that one race, some of the least racist person in this room.
Then they went to recession, there's going to be a recession. Oh, please let there be a recession, please, because we have a better chance of defeating him if there's a recession. And unfortunately, the stock market's only a few points from it's all-time high, which we've broken on, I think it's, well over a hundred times, we broke the all-time record.
And now they have a new one that I'm enriching my sublimity. By doing this, and taking this particular job, which I love, it will cost me billions and billions of dollars. But if somebody from the Middle East that I never saw before comes in and stays in one of my hotels for an evening and pays $439. Emoluments, nobody ever heard the word emolument before.
Emolument. Nobody ever heard that word, emoluments. He's enriching himself. If somebody buys a tank of gas in Scotland from an airport that I don't know, and they happen to go to a hotel, he's enriching himself like 20 people. And they lose billions of dollars and that's OK. I expected to do that when I did it, I didn't know what would happen if I lost.
Can you imagine? Supposing I lost and we would have had the same basic rhetoric. I mean, winning was great. Supposing, you know, I'm doing all the things I'm telling you all the same sort of thing, supposing I didn't make it. I'd have to go around, I would have lost and lost billions. Then I would have been really unhappy, but I'll tell you what, I expected that when I did this in terms of opportunity, in terms of certain places, they can never do as well when you have this kind of rhetoric, they can never do. So I'll lose billions of dollars always expected.
They say I enrich myself because somebody is going to stay at my hotel. It doesn't work that way, folks, and these are very, very dishonest people and they know it. So they've, given up what every other you know it too, you,get it. The Democrat agenda of open borders, places vast burdens on your communities and your schools and your hospitals and public safety.
All at the expense of hardworking New Mexico families and throughout our country, sheriffs and commissioners from nine Mexico counties recently sent a letter to your state's congressional delegation, begging them to vote for strong border security. They want in New Mexico. They don't want open borders, they don't want criminals pouring into your communities and doing what they do and we won't even talk about that.
They want strong -- These are people that are with you. In many cases, Democrats, they write letters. We need strong border security. You know in San Diego, California is very difficult, always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego, good mayor in San Diego, by the way. They wanted a wall, and I said, You know what, let's build it someplace else, because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain.
But then I said you know the people are pouring in. They needed it. They're pouring into San Diego, like going all over the place and people that had houses, they didn't like people running over their gardens all day long coming in from the other side. So we put up a wall and I thought everybody would be happy.
As soon as it was finished, the day it was finished, I was notified, we didn't want the wall, Why did you do the wall? And I will tell you, in other words, it's all a game. I'd love to take the sucker down and move it right down to New Mexico And if I did that they'd go crazy and they'd say, Please, sir, don't do that.
Please, please. The same people that are saying we don't want a wall. Why did you put up a wall? And I knew that was going to happen. I told my people that was going to happen, but they're very happy with their wall. Most of them won't say it, they love it, it stopped, it only stopped 99.9% of the people coming in. And the only reason I'm not moving into New Mexico is that it would cost more money to move it than to build you a brand new beautiful wall.
So I'll give you a break if true. It's true. I actually priced it out. It's true. This contract is all my life. I've been there. They can find a way to make money. Sir, it'll cost more money to move the wall than to build a new one. They have -- They have it. But the commission -- your commissioners, wrote, I quote, Our communities do not have the resources nor the budgets to handle the massive influx of immigrants we are experiencing.
This is your commissioners writing to us in Washington. Our scarce resources are in danger of being rapidly depleted to the point that we will be unable to effectively care for our own citizens, you, and our existing homeless populations, many of whom are American veterans, right? So Democrats put illegal aliens before American citizens.
Republicans believe that we must take care of our own citizens first, I'm sorry. That includes millions of hardworking, lawful immigrants who waited in line, follow the rules and came into our country legally. And among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are Hispanic-Americans who obey our laws, pay their taxes contribute to our communities and play by the rules and they're the ones that want to see something done, and we are doing it at a level that nobody else would be capable of doing.
Whether you're a first generation or a tenth generation, every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, and is always loyal to you. Your politicians have not been loyal to you. They've been loyal to themselves. The Democrats are also trying to turn every city in America into a sanctuary for criminal alien and that's one of the very good reasons we won on Tuesday night, North Carolina, because they let people out of their sanctuary city and what those people did, I will not tell you tonight, but it wasn't good it's one of the reasons we had big victories, two of them in North Carolina, sanctuary cities and plenty of people, even in California, where they have sanctuary cities.
They don't want sanctuary cities, the politicians do, but they don't want them. Right here in New Mexico, democrats are trying to turn you into a total sanctuary state, creating a safe harbor for dangerous criminal aliens and gang members that sanctuary policies released from jail. Now think of it, they want to make your whole state a sanctuary state.
So when MS-13 comes in -- and I told you before -- we take them out by the thousands and they're tough, they're tough, but our ICE folks are even tougher. There's nobody to but you're, I would say naive, but maybe it's much worse than -- they're naive, these politicians, they're naive politicians. They don't want ice to come in. They don't want to take these criminals out and if you don't take them out and they're in New Mexico, I got to tell you something, folks, You got problems.
You've got problems. You've got big problems. Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans not for criminal aliens. And Republicans will always support the heroes of ICE Border Patrol and our great law enforcement. The Democrat Party -- Do you notice I always say the Democrat Party?
You know, before I came they were all going democratic because it sounds better, right? It does. it's much nicer. The Democratic Party is much nicer than the Democrat Party, but their name is the Democrat Party and I'm not looking for them to sound nice. I want to give their name so I always say the Democrat Party, but that's their name, the Democrat Party.
Frankly, they should probably change it because it does -- and then I call the Democratic Party, but the Democrat Party has never been farther outside the mainstream. Every major -- it's a nasty fly. I don't like those suckers, I don't know about you in New Mexico, but I'm not into flies or mosquitoes. I don't like snakes too much.
We have plenty of them in New York and Washington a different variety. I don't like snakes either. We've got a lot of snakes in Washington. D.C. We've got a lot of steaks in New York. I don't like either kind of snake. I think I like the kind on the ground better than the ones we have in [Inaudible] . Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of health care that would destroy Medicare as we know it today.
My administration will protect Medicare and defend your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. The Republicans will always do that. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 50 years.
You don't hear this because the fake news doesn't want to read about it. You know, sometimes I have a news conference about something good, so good and I'll say you know, I call my wife first lady. First lady. People love our First Lady. I'll say, When you see television tonight and we did something that was so great whatever it may be, we did a lot of things.
We did something so great and it won't be on. But if there's something that's just slightly negative or even if it's good that they could turn negative, that's what they like best. Take something good and turn it negative. It's breaking. We have breaking news, we have breaking news, these are phony people, but that's OK. You know when you think of it, I'm president and they're not.
Crazy. It's crazy. You know sometimes I'll be in the Oval Office and I'll be with my people. We have great people, and I say, You know -- And it's great calm in the Oval Office. You don't like to hear about it because you don't hear about it too much, that's not worth it, but we have great calm, considering it's pretty wild stuff going on in the world, right?
But I'll be saying you know they don't treat us right. They don't treat us right, it's not fair, it's not this and then I'll just sit back and say, Look, we're in the Oval Office and they're not. It's pretty amazing, it's pretty amazing. And when you have the Democrat Party and the press, the media, the lame stream media, the fake News and their partners, they are partners, OK? Remember the word manufactured?
They used the word manufacturer or something never been used for that thing, and every news gets. The manufactured crisis started the next one. This crisis was manufactured every one of them use the word manufacture. They know what I'm talking about. Now that's called collusion, folks. That's real collusion.
You know, you have that, and so you have the Democrats, you have the media, they're partners. Then you have the deep state we're getting rid of a lot of them. I'll tell you, we're fighting them left and right. Boom. Well, you take a look at I'll. Tell you what, I'll tell you what, You take a look at what we're doing with all of the things.
I'm not going to get into detail. But you know what I'm talking about, clean the swamp, that's the ultimate cleaning of the swamp. And then I hate to say this. But we have some Republicans they're, not good. You call them a rhino, they're rhinos, the rhinos are worse and some of them are worse than the Obama people, right?
The worst of the Obama people they're worse than the Clinton people, but there aren't too many of them left they're pretty much on respirators, they're gasping, they're gasping for air, but we do have some bad people that you wouldn't believe. I didn't hear you. Why did you say? What? I didn't hear that.
Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth, and that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Right? I see it, just like Mom, I see it. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and socialism.
The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it is the party of the American dream. We've achieved record funding for the US military. All of that money, trillions and trillions of dollars spent all produced right here in the good old USA, [Audience Chants "USA"] and I have to tell you, New Mexico, I know you're going to like this, a lot of those trillions because you know when you do the 7 16 and the 7 30 and the 700 billion all of a sudden you're in trillions, and I can save a lot of lines when I just say trillions.
A lot of that money is going to be spent in the state of the art military equipment, that's being used at Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range, Kirtland Air Force Base and many other vital New Mexico military installations that are going up as we speak. That's also jobs, but more importantly, that even jobs -- Incredible what you've done for the military in New Mexico is incredible and we've remembered, but we're pouring a lot of money into New Mexico.
And that means a lot of good thing. And we're investing in our nation's nuclear security, including right here in New Mexico and Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal. It was no good and we imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian regime.
Watch how that works out, folks. It's going to be very good. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And don't forget what I did for Israel with respect to Golan Heights. Don't forget. Right? For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for New Mexico.
And you must never forget, get out there and vote and get ready and get everybody. We need it because we're fighting a lot of forces, including Facebook, I saw, and Google I saw. Did you see Google? He said I may have lost 2 million to 10 million votes according to this character that worked at Google, right?
And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive. From two million to 10.5 million votes and we won. I don't know we must be doing -- I will say this, that happened and people came from the valleys. They came from everywhere. They came from places that nobody's ever talked about before, and it was the forgotten men and women, but the truth is, I know these men and women and they're the most incredible men and women in this country.
They really are. They just never had anybody, they really wanted to vote for, or at least for a long time they didn't want to get out there. They said, Boy, oh boy, is this the best they can do? I mean in all fairness. I don't want to go too early here. Look at the field. Did you watch the debate the other day?
We've got almost $350 million people. I'll take it. That's the best they can do. We'll see, we'll see you never want to get too cocky. Somebody said, In the great state of Texas, Donald Trump is down two points to Buttigieg, Buttigieg, Buttigieg. They're phony polls. You know they have phony polls. I told the story the other night.
For six months. I was hearing that I'm going to lose the state of Texas and friends of mine from Texas that look just like these guys. See these two guys with a hat? They might even be better looking. If they look just like -- and they're own just say, I don't know about you, but I know a lot about Texas and Donald Trump, he's not going to be losing the state of Texas.
Remember that? See, they don't say it's in play, they're too smart. They say Texas is in play and Utah they said was in play. All these are in play. In play means we could lose them, right? It's a better term, though, because this way they can't get skunked, but they can get skunked with me. So what happens is on that?
Beautiful election, that was not one of the greatest coolest nights ever. Well, you know they can never call a victory unless you absolutely have it and unless you're winning by a lot. This is six months, Texas is in play, you know he could lose Texas. I keep saying I go to a stadium. We sell out thousands of people lines that are miles long.
I mean, and every friend of mine, says you're going to win by a lot, so they announce eight o'clock, whatever time, the polls in Texas are closed. Donald Trump, has won the state of Texas. The polls in Utah are closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. They don't even take a breath. Now, if it's close, like it's in play, you know you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even take a breath because they're called suppression polls and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people say.
They're no different. They're suppression polls. And I'll tell you what, we're going to win the state of New Mexico and I'll be so surprised if we didn't. You know we're going to win New Mexico. You know when I came here during the last election, came here a little because I was told very hard to win and I came here a little bit and I saw great spirit, but I didn't really have a track record because you know I never did this stuff before so I said I was going to cut your taxes.
I did. I said I was going to cut you regulations. I did more than any president in history and they've been there for many years. I've been there for two and a half. And I think the regulation cutting, like the waters of the U.S. That was another beauty where you couldn't build a house. You couldn't farm your land.
Now what we've done on regulations is incredible. I've done. I've rebuilt our military. I've taken care of our vets. Look how happy our vets are with choice. Instead of waiting for two months to see a doctor or two weeks or three days, they now go out. If there's a wait, they go out, they get a private doctor, they get taken care of, we pay the bill and for the first time they've tried to get that for 45 years they haven't been able to get it, but I'm good at getting things.
You must never forget the 2020 election is about one thing, what's it about it's about you, it is it's about you, it's about you. You know I'm doing a good job as your messenger, but basically I'm a messenger. I know what you want. I understand that it's about your family, it's about your future and it's about the fate of your country, for your children, for everybody, it's about the fate of your country, it's about the future of our great country, no matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.
That's what it's about. Look at Venezuela, Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world and today very sad, no food, no water, no, nothing. Socialism. We begin this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda and the only positive vision for America, and it's not just a little bit positive.
Our country is going to be greater than it ever was. That's where we're headed. Together, we will help millions more citizens, know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well done. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair and very lawful system of immigration.
And we're going to have a lot done anyway. We already do have a lot. Then you saw the figures last week, but we're doing it the hard way would be so much easier. With a little stroke of the pen, we will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words that incredible phrase: Made in the USA.
We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within ten years that we've already started that program. It will happen. We have the medicine. Nobody even knew that. The AIDS epidemic in this country will be gone within ten years.
We've already started the process. It's been funded, it's been funded. Who would have thought that. Honestly, when I ran, I didn't know that we have now the technology and what they've done with respect to AIDS is incredible. What a terrible, terrible period of time the world went through, but we will have it ended within 10 years.
We will defeat the effort to drive up the cost of houses, cars, healthcare, light bulbs, right? They took away our light bulb. I want an incandescent light. I want to look better. Ok, I want to pay less money to look better. Does that make sense? You pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that, with the new bulbs, if they break it's considered a hazardous waste site, it's all gases inside and you're supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container, give me a break.
I ask the people, the professionals. Well, what do people do when it breaks because they break all the time? What do they do? Nothing they throw it away. So I owe a lot of people didn't know. They didn't understand. You're a much better light at a much reduced cost and it's much safer because when those other bulbs break they really are dangerous.
The gases come out they're dangerous. These are little things that I have to explain, otherwise, people would say What the hell are you doing with light bulbs and we're trying to do the same thing with cars. Cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline, they have so much junk that they're less safe.
So what I want to do is the following: Under our rules and regulations that cars are environmentally terrific, but they're, safer and they're $3,500 less to buy. Right? and the reason they're safer is because they can be a little bit heavier makes sense, right. They could be a little bit heavier, I mean they make them now, like papier mch. Somebody touches them in the entire car collapses.
When somebody hits me, I want to be in as close to an army tank as possible. Now they're made out of paper mch. They weigh about three pounds and if you get hit by a bus, it's over. They say what happened to that car. No, I think of it. It's safer, it's less expensive by $3,500 on average. And California wants you to do the other cars and we don't we're going to end up in a big litigation and I'm fighting for you.
Look. Look. It's -- it's not the kind of thing most presidents would be fighting for because they say I pay more, let it be unsafe, listen to the environmentalists and I'm an environmentalist, I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things.
You know right now we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country. But what are they going to do about China, and India, and Russia and other countries that are spewing stuff? What do we do about them? We're going to keep our nation clean, but you know the universe is so big that when you talk about China, the USA, India, you talk about these different places where a lot of bad stuff comes out, right?
It's so big that it's right next to each other. It's right next to each other. Does that make sense, right? It's right next to each other. So what are they going to do? We want to have the cleanest water and the cleanest air. We will defend privacy, we will defend free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and we will always proudly defend your Second Amendment, and we're doing it now.
And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one American. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement, we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that mothers and fathers, not Washington bureaucrats, know best how to raise their strong, beautiful families in their loving and wonderful communities.
We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, nobody will ever take it down. Nobody will ever take it down. We will never allow them to take it down, In God We Trust.
we stand on the shoulders of American patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are going to be better than ever before, and it won't even be close and we're right there. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered sciences, won two World Wars, defeated fascism, and communism, put a man on the moon and build the most exceptional country in the history of the world.
And every day of my presidency we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to each and every one of you. Right. With your help, your devotion, and your drive -- [Protesters interrupt rally] Hey. That's too bad. He did it right in the crescendo. How do you top that?
I'm just ready? The big beautiful crescendo in his character is going back home. All right. It's two people tonight remember when they say massive protests at the Trump rally, two people. [Audience Chants "USA"] With your help, your devotion, and you drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, a win like never before.
We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of the great State of New Mexico, we love you. The best is yet to come. Best is yet to come. Thank you, New Mexico. And together we will make America wealthy again, very, very wealthy.
We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, New Mexico. Thank you. Thank you, Mexico. Thank you. Thank you.
So this is supposed to be a Democrat state. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. They have a very big surprise coming, don't you think? Very big surprise. Hello, Minnesota. Great state. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be back in the heartland with thousands of hard-working and truly great American patriots.
You know that. In less than two years of Republican leadership, America has achieved the biggest comeback in our history. True. Jobs are booming, wages are rising and the number of Americans working right now today has reached an all-time high in our history. We are defending our great Second Amendment... taking care of our wonderful veterans, who we love and respect... and our military will soon be more powerful than ever before by far.
But the radical Democrats want to take it all away. They want to destroy our prosperity. We've had great prosperity. You see what's happening. You don't want your 401(k)s being cut in half, and if you vote Democrat, that's what's going to happen. They want to erase our gains and plunge our country into a nightmare of gridlock, poverty, chaos and, frankly, crime, because that's what comes with it. So we're just five weeks away from one of the most important congressional elections in our lifetime.
You see what's happening in Washington right now so you know how important it is. You see what's going on. By the way, look back there, look at all that media. Look at all that media. If we could ever get them on our side, we'd win for a thousand years -- for a thousand years. On Tuesday, November 6th, I need your vote, I need your support to stop radical Democrats and to elect proud Minnesota Republicans.
And we have some great ones right now up for election. This week I announced another historic victory for our nation. We're replacing the job-killing disaster known as NAFTA... with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. It's called the USMCA. That works, right? USMCA. I didn't want to use NAFTA. That has been a disaster for our country: 50,000 plants and factories moving out, millions and millions of jobs lost, one of the worst trade deals ever.
I actually know one that's worse, but I won't tell you, because we're going to be doing something with that too. But NAFTA's been one of the great disasters of all time and now we have a great and fair deal. We have a fair deal, and that's what we want. Great for our workers and really great for our farmers.
It's about time. We're opening it up. The barriers are coming down. And this is tremendous for Minnesota. This is tremendous for Minnesota. And you've waited for a long time. And by the way, we've got plenty coming. You know what's going on with China? They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. But I say they're not ready yet.
They want to make a deal, but I told them, "You want to make a deal, but you're not ready yet, so we'll talk later." We have secured landmark protections for the medical innovations being produced right here in your great state. You have great medical in your state. And we've removed unfair trade barriers for our proud Minnesota farmers and our dairy producers like has never, ever been done before in our country.
America is winning again and America is being respected again all over the world right now, and we're going to keep it that way forever. It's called America first. [Audience Chants USA] You even have people sitting behind the flag. That's... It's OK. Great people. And by the way, you got thousands of people outside and you have thousands of people who I just saw in a lovely room, but I said, "Next time, you have to get here a couple of days earlier." Right?
The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. That's really it. Because you're winning. You're winning a lot. There's never been an administration that in already less than two years -- but can you believe we all did this together? We're coming up on two years, can you believe it? There has never been an administration, with you, that's done so much in so little time.
Two years. No administration's come close. None has come close. And we've got a lot coming. If Democrats take over Congress, the stock market will plummet. They will -- it will plummet. You know, there's a reason for it. Every day we hit new highs, new highs. I think we had 103 new highs. Think of it. All time.
That means jobs. To a lot of people, it means great 401(k)s. It means great -- but to a lot of people, it means jobs. It's jobs. Your 401(k)s will be devastated if Democrats take control and our political system will grind to a really messy halt. And you see what's going on in Congress right now with one of the most respected people, potentially, hopefully Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Man... [Audience Chants We Want Kavanaugh] What they're putting him through, and his family. His family is incredible. What they're putting them through. Democrats want to raise your taxes. They want to restore job-killing regulations. There's no administration ever that's cut as many regulations. And we have regulations.
We want clean water. We want crystal, clear air. We want beautiful environment. We want. But you don't have to have regulation that makes it impossible for our country to compete with other countries, and that's what we're doing. The Democrats want to cripple law enforcement. They want to get rid of ICE. How about ICE? ICE, they're tough and they love our country, but you need tough ones.
They're tough. They love our country. They get rid of MS-13. They get rid of these gangs. You wouldn't believe it. They throw them the hell out or they bring them to jail. The Democrats embrace socialism. We're not going to be Venezuela -- you see what's happening -- and open our borders to deadly drugs and violent gangs.
And I've said it and I'll say it as many times as you want to hear it, and it's because of their policy: The Democrats are truly the party of crime, because that's what happens. Open borders, that's what happens. And the Dems are willing to do anything to hurt anyone to get the power they so desperately crave.
All they know is how to do -- you know what the words are -- they want to resist, they want to obstruct, they want to delay, demolish, they want to destroy. That's what happens. That's what happens. And just take a look at what's going on. Democrats have been trying to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaugh... since the very first second he was announced.
And he was announced for one simple reason: He is an incredible intellect, an incredible person, an incredible talent. He's been an incredible judge. Because they know that Judge Kavanaugh will protect, uphold and defend the Constitution of The United States as written. But all you have to do is look at the polls over the last three or four days and it shows that their rage-fueled resistance is starting to backfire at a level that nobody has ever seen before.
Nobody's ever seen it. Up 11, up 10, up 14. Nobody's ever seen this before. We love it. Do we love it? We love it. Because people see what's happening and they don't like it. The people of Minnesota and the people of America are going to reject the Democrat politics of anger and destruction, and they are going to vote to keep making America great again, greater than ever before.
And in two years, they are going to vote to keep America great, right? Keep America great. We're almost at that point already, but I can't -- I love "Make America Great," but I can't use it in two years. They'll say, "What have you been doing?" right? "What have you been doing?" Oh, boy, I tell you, it's been a while.
We have had fun, right? We've had fun. This is -- and they don't even correct me when I say it. They don't even correct me. Fake news media. But this is... I mean, look at this stadium. Look, look. As an example, thousands of people in a room next door, thousands and thousands of people outside trying to get in, this big stadium is packed, always.
In all fairness to Minnesota, in Las Vegas, in Missouri. You know in Missouri... [Audience Member calls out] Thank you. I love you too, but you're not my type. No, but -- hey, Missouri. They had 44,000 people outside of a big arena. 44,000 people. Las Vegas. We went to -- West Virginia was incredible. West Virginia.
Tennessee. Tennessee, and you see how far Tennessee went up over the last couple of days. It's incredible. Missouri, wow, have we done great. Josh, Josh. So we're thrilled to be joined by a number of your terrific Republican leaders and I just want to introduce somebody that's been such an incredible help to me in getting your tax cuts, I mean, not so bad.
How about this? How about this? The Dems want to raise your taxes. We want to lower your taxes. We don't want crime. Crime's OK for them. They want open borders. How the hell do we not win this thing in a landslide every time? How do you... They're for crime and high taxes. We're for low taxes and no crime.
I don't know. Somehow I don't think I would have been a very good politician on the other side of this equation. But a man who really has been helping me a lot, he's a tremendous force in Washington, he's respected by everybody, Congressman Tom Emmer. Minnesota House Speaker Kurt Daudt. Thanks, Kurt. Your state's next attorney general, Doug Wardlow.
Your next governor -- I hear he's doing very well -- Jeff Johnson. We're also joined by the next United States senator from Minnesota, Karin Housley. Karin. So, Karin is running against a far-left Democrat, Tina Smith, who nobody knows who the hell she is. Who is she? She was appointed. She took a wacky guy's place.
That guy was -- he was wacky. Boy, did he fold up like a wet rag, huh? Man. Man, he was gone so fast. He was gone so fast. I don't want to mention Al Franken's name. OK? So I won't mention it. He was gone -- he was gone so fast. It was like, "Oh, he did something, oh, oh, oh, I resign. I quit, I quit." Wow. He was gone and he was replaced by somebody that nobody ever heard of. Her name is Tina Smith.
Honestly, you know, I do this stuff for a living. I'm not sure I have ever heard of her [Inaudible]. The fact is, there's no reason for me to have heard of her, because she's never going to vote for us. She'll always vote for Schumer and Pelosi...and, of course, the legendary low-IQ Maxine Waters. Low-IQ person.
She'll be with Schumer, do whatever he wants. "What would you like me to do? Should I vote for higher taxes?" "Yes." "Oh, I want higher taxes. Should I vote against the wall?" Which is happening, folks. She wants to vote against the wall. She voted against the wall. [Audience Chants Build that Wall] So we are building the wall.
We started it. $1.6 billion. Now we got another $1.6 billion and we just got another. But I want to build it at one time, fast. But we're making a lot of progress on the wall. A lot of progress. I'd like to do it a lot faster. I'm good at building. And Tina voted for deadly sanctuary cities. Karin... Karin, do you promise you will not be voting for sanctuary cities, Karin?
OK. Good. She wants to keep crime out of Minnesota. That sounds like a good platform, right? Tina Smith would rather protect violent criminal aliens than loyal American citizens, which is why Tina Smith, that nobody ever heard of, needs to be voted out of office. She got appointed, I guess. And Tina Smith is voting against Judge Kavanaugh.
Can you believe that one? So, he was number one at Yale, number one at Yale Law School. I think she's looking for a better student. [Laughter] Finally, I want to introduce two incredible -- by the way, Karin, come up, please, will you?
You really do go off script, don't you? Jeez. Thank you so much for telling everybody. And he said "Tina Smith" way too many times. We need to say "Karin Housley" a lot more. Thank you.
Vote for her. Vote for Karin. Now for the people that we're here for. Congress is very important, and I'm here to support Congressman Jason Lewis, who you know. He's a friend of mine, who has worked so hard for us and so hard on your Second Amendment, which is under siege, and so hard on cutting your taxes and regulations.
So, Jason, thank you. Come on up, Jason. And the next representative from Minnesota's 1st District, Jim Hagedorn. Come on up, fellas.
Welcome to Minnesota, Mr. President. Now -- now, everybody in this room knows Minnesota loves President Trump. But I will tell you, in 2020, when he comes back here and takes this state, the whole world's going to know Minnesota loves President Trump. And you know what else Minnesota loves, Mr. President?
They love tax cuts that let you keep more of your money. Now, in the final analysis, that's really it, isn't it? I mean, growth is great, 4.5 percent growth, more job openings than job-seekers, after-tax income up 6 percent in one year. But in the final analysis, whose money is it? It's yours. You ought to have it. Minnesota loves manufacturing, mining and energy production in the 2nd District.
Minnesota loves our farmers now, thanks to the president, who have free trade and fair trade. Right here in Rochester, Minnesota is very proud and loves health care; the kind of plan that you choose, not the plan that government bureaucrats choose for you. And that's why we repealed the Obamacare mandate and the president signed it into law.
And -- and one more thing, Mr. President. Minnesota loves your judicial appointments. That's right. Minnesota loves your appointments to the lower courts, they love your appointments to the appellate courts, and Minnesota loves your appointments to the Supreme Court, including Judge Brett Kavanaugh. My friends, my friends, that's what's at stake in this election: due process, the presumption of innocence, the rule of law, private property, in other words, the Constitution of the United States.
And if Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker of the House, you can throw that all aside. But you know what? The radical resisters have to come through Minnesota first. And this is where it stops. I'm not going to let it happen, Jim Hagedorn isn't going to let it happen, and President Donald J. Trump is not going to let it happen.
Thank you all. On to November and let's win there.
Thank you. Wow. Does Rochester, Minnesota, and southern Minnesota love this president? Absolutely. Boy, think back... Think back where we were just two years ago. Our nation's future was on the line. Had we not won that election, we would have lost the country the way the forefathers put it together. And by the grace of God, and we are grateful and proud, Mr. President, that [Inaudible], and thank you for what you're doing for our country.
We are. I just want to give the president a quick update on the Democrat Party here in Minnesota. They've moved far to the left like the rest of the Democrats across the country. We actually have a guy running for governor who wants to make Minnesota a sanctuary state. We have -- we have two people running for the United States Senate on the Democrat Party.
They love late-term abortion and they believe in gun control. And we have all these congressional candidates, including the guy I'm running against, who think that we should have socialized medicine, single-payer. Does that make sense for the Mayo Clinic, Rochester? No, no. They want to resist. They want to replace.
They want to take us back to Obama and then some. Are we going to let that happen? Heck no. No. Not going to let that happen. [Audience Responds No] Mr. President, we're going to work tirelessly. And because of your support and leadership and your endorsement, I want to go out to Washington and serve as a conservative reinforcement to partner with you to keep moving America in the right direction.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Wow. Wow. Good talent. So, Jason and Jim are both running against extreme Democrats. Jim's opponent, Dan Feehan... supports a total government takeover of health care, which drives your costs right through the roof and the health care is lousy, by the way. Oh, is that so? And he wants to make Minnesota into -- true -- a sanctuary for the criminal aliens and for gang members.
That's the people -- they will come flooding up here as soon as you do it. It happens every time. Jason's opponent, Angie Craig... Who the hell is Angie Craig? -- also wants to take away your health care. And she refuses to support Enbridge Pipeline. You know all about that. That would bring more than 8,000 jobs to Minnesota.
And you know we've really opened up Minnesota. You see what's going on with the mines and the miners and the ore. Worst of all, a vote for Dan Feehan and Angie Craig is a vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House. Can you imagine Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House? Don't do that to me. I didn't buy into that.
Neither did you. If Democrats take charge, Maxine Waters will also... Now, listen to this one. She's going to take over Financial Services in Congress. Can you believe it? Maxine Waters. That's one of the most powerful committees in Congress. If you want to stop Pelosi from becoming speaker, if you want to stop Chuck Schumer from becoming majority leader... and if you want to stop the radical Democrats from running Congress, then you need to vote Republican.
You have to get out there on November 6th and vote Republican. You've got to get it -- and vote for these people. These are great people. A Democrat-controlled Congress would also pose a grave threat to Medicare. You know what they're doing with Medicare? They'll destroy it. The majority of House Democrats have cosponsored a socialist takeover of health care that would obliterate Medicare.
Their plan is called Medicare for All, except they have no money. But it's really Medicare for none. Their plan would rob American seniors of the benefits they have paid -- and they've paid these benefits and they've paid so much money for their entire lives and you take it away. [Audience Member shouts] Thank you, darling.
Love these people. These people are so great. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors, who have earned it and they've paid for it. And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We're going to take care of them. Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending pre-existing conditions and some people have -- you know what I say?
We'll get a little more money from China. It'll be just fine. OK? It'll be just fine. We'll be just fine. We're going to take care of pre-existing conditions, folks. Remember that. The lead sponsor of the Democrats -- think of this. The health care takeover, who is the lead sponsor? I've been reading so much about him.
He did predict I was going to win, by the way. I will say that. That's the only thing he's gotten right in a long time. Keith Ellison. Did you know that? No, he did. That's right. He was on a show the day after I announced. On June 16th, I came down the stair with Melania -- who's right now in Africa, our first lady.
She's doing a great job. Doing a great job for the people of Africa. Amazing. But Ellison was on a show the day after I announced and he looked at two people, the hosts, he said, "You know he's going to win, don't you?" And they smiled. One laughed. They spoke. They thought I was just doing this for fun.
You think this is fun? You think this... This is a lot of work. It's a lot more work than anybody knew. And that's the last time he's been right, but I'm glad he was right about that. Ellison is the number two official in the entire Democrat Party and he recently marched in a parade wearing a shirt that read, "I do not believe in borders." Oh, that's wonderful.
By the way, you don't have borders, you don't have a country, folks. You don't have a country. Keith Ellison's Democrat Party embraces radical socialism and open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE. They want to unleash violent predators and ruthless killers -- and you know it. Somebody would say, "Oh, gee, why is he saying that?
That's not" -- it's true. Like MS-13, near our schools, near our families and into our communities. No good. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And Republicans proudly stand with the brave men and women of ICE, Border Patrol and law enforcement, our police.
Great people. They do an incredible job. My administration has also reformed our refugee program to protect American communities like you have in Minnesota, where you're being treated very unfairly, and to protect your families and your taxpayer dollars. If you want security, if you want a border, then what you have to do is immediately go out, think about it, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your workers.
You've got to go November 6th, vote Republican. That'll do it. That'll do it. We need the votes. You know, I keep hearing we have a majority. If somebody has a cold, we don't have a majority. If somebody's not feeling great, we don't have a majority. It's like -- it's like the saying -- that's why we're getting the wall by hook, by crook, we're getting the wall, but it's so difficult.
These guys want to stop it. They want to say -- you know, it's interesting. We've got $700 billion for the military, which is, you know, many, many, many times -- we've got $716 billion for the military. We are rebuilding our military. But to get money for the wall, their whole life is trying to obstruct the wall because they know we want it. But you know what?
It's not working. I'd like to do it a lot faster, but it's not working. We're getting the money. You think it's easy? Not easy. But we're getting it built and it's already going up in San Diego and lots of other places along the border. [Audience Chants Build that Wall] This election is about safety and it's about prosperity.
Since the election, we have created over 4 million new jobs. The media will tell you there was no way we could have said that during the campaign. Nobody would have believed it. And we've lifted 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Think of that. You know, when you do that, you save a lot of money and you also make a lot of people really happy.
When you think about it, right? We've added nearly a half a million new manufacturing jobs. Remember, "You need a magic wand. You'll never do that." I said, "What happens? We don't build anything anymore?" And we have companies pouring into our country and they're coming to Minnesota. They're coming to a lot of states.
But we have companies. They're all coming back. They want to be where the action is. They're all coming back. They're all coming back. The auto companies. I was with Prime Minister Abe two days ago. He said, "Many of our auto companies are coming back." I said, "No, no, that's not good enough. All of them have to come back.
All." And he's going to do that. They're all coming back. They've already started. You look at Michigan, what's going on in Michigan, where they're coming back so fast -- but they're coming back to Ohio. They're coming back to Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Carolina. And they're coming in to a place called Minnesota.
Do we love Minnesota? 1972. You know what that is, right? That was the last time -- and boy, we came, like, this close. One more speech up here and I would have won this state. I came -- do you remember? I said, "I think I'm going to win Minnesota," and everyone said, "No, no, it hasn't been won since 1972." Is that right? 19 -- right?
The Congress [Inaudible], right? Yeah. 1972. It hasn't been won. I said, "No, look at the crowds. They love it. We're going to take care of Minnesota. We're going to stop what's happening that's so unfair in Minnesota." And then on election night, I said, "Let's go to Minnesota," but they already scheduled for a great place, a great state, Michigan.
That's another one hadn't been won in many, many years. I went to Michigan. We had 32,000 people in Michigan at 1 o'clock in the morning. It was already Election Day. So I had to skip Minnesota. I felt so badly because one more speech -- I could have showed up at 3 o'clock in the morning maybe. I don't know.
But we're going to win. We're going to win Minnesota. And you see that just by this crowd. Look at this crowd. This place is... So something I'm very proud of, African-American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. Think of those two sound bites.
The lowest unemployment, the lowest rate of poverty. So think of this: How does your African-American, how do you vote for somebody else? I've done more for them in two years. African-Americans are coming up and they're saying, "Mr. President, thank you. Thank you." And their median income is the highest.
But not only for African-Americans, for Asian, for Hispanic. Hispanic unemployment is the lowest it's ever been. Think of it. Asian unemployment, the lowest it's ever been. People with no high school diploma -- that's a very important group of people to me -- it is by far the lowest it's ever been. Women I'm failing with.
I am failing with women. It's only the lowest in 65 years. Sorry. Sorry. I thought it would be history by now, because I've been saying African-American, I've been saying Hispanic, I've been saying Asian, I've been -- and women, it's only the lowest in 65 years. But I thought by now, it would be OK. [Audience member calls out] Got a lot of energy, this one over here.
She's got a lot of energy. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Sixty-five years, not bad, but soon it's going to be in history, I predict. My administration has taken the toughest-ever action cracking down on China's trading abuses. We have to stop it. And we have a very good relationship with President Xi. I have a very good relationship.
But we can't allow what's happened over so many years to continue happening. They've been taking $500 billion, with a B, out of our country and rebuilding China. And I said, "We can't do that anymore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry." For years, China has been draining us, taking our factories and building up their country with our money, and at the expense of our workers and our companies.
And we're not going to have it. No more. And not only China. Many countries. Look, many countries. We defend countries that are very rich. They don't pay us or they pay us a small percentage. I mean, look, we get along great with these countries, but take Saudi Arabia. Would you say they have some money?
So we defend them and they pay a small percentage. I said, "Excuse me, King Salman" -- he's my friend -- "do you mind paying for the military?" "Do you mind? Hey." They're paying for 30 percent. I said, "Do you mind paying?" "But nobody has asked me." I said, "But I'm asking you, King." He says, "Great." He said, "But are you serious?" I said, "No, I'm totally serious.
Trust me." [Laughter] And they'll do it. He said nobody's ever asked him. You're talking about -- by the way, you're talking about billions and billions of dollars. Japan, "No, President Obama would never have asked. That's not his kind of thing. Not his thing." Why would somebody ask to be paid back billions of dollars?
Japan, very rich, very great country. I told you, Prime Minister Abe, great man. Just won a fantastic election. Big results. I have an -- an incredible relationship. I said to him, "Listen, we're defending you." We're doing a great job. They were sending missiles over Japan from North Korea. Because of me, those missiles aren't going over Japan anymore.
There are no more missiles, no more testing, no more nuclear. We got our hostages back. We got the remains of our great heroes back, right? The remains. The remains are coming back. That was the most beautiful ceremony. Did anybody see that ceremony a month ago? So beautiful. And the remains are coming back.
And what do I get? I get the fake news saying, "Why isn't he moving faster?" I just left -- what? -- three months ago. I had a meeting in Singapore. I mean, this has been going on for 75 years -- now let's say 25 years with the missiles and the nuclear -- but no president's done anything. It's -- it's like, three months.
And they'll say, the all-time great, "What's taking so long?" I said, "It's been three months and you don't have rockets and you don't have missiles and you don't have nuclear testing and we get all of our" -- I mean, it's crazy. But here's what they say. So, they can't get me. One of them actually said -- a nice guy, a friend of mine.
He actually said, "Why is the president giving so much to North Korea?" I said, "I haven't given anything. What have I given?" I haven't paid -- I didn't pay $1.8 billion for the hostages like Obama did... with Iran, remember? $1.8 billion in cash. Gave them $150 billion. So I haven't given. But I have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim. I have a very good relationship.
So because of that relationship, let's see. I think we'll work something out. Maybe we won't. Who knows? It's a deal. Let's see. But so far -- so I'm -- when did I leave, like three months ago, three and a half months ago, maybe less? And they're saying, "He agreed to meet," because they -- I didn't give -- so you know what I gave them?
I agreed to meet. That's what they say. I agreed to meet. Is that a big deal? I agreed to meet. I asked the Democrats before -- you know, we were close to a war with North Korea, I'll you what. And my rhetoric was very tough at the beginning. It was really, really tough. In fact, they all said I'm going to cause a war with North Korea.
I'm going to cause a war. And then with Putin of Russia, they said, "He was too nice." He was -- that was a great meeting. We had a very successful -- so they want me to get into a boxing match with him. I think I'd do very well. But with Russia... [Audience Chants USA] No, no. It's the fake news. Fake news.
They said with Russia, "He was too nice. He was too nice." With North Korea, they said, "He was too tough. He was too tough." And let me tell you, if I was really rough with Russia, they'd say, "He was too tough. He was too tough." These people are loco, I'm telling you. Loco. [Laughter] People are crazy.
Fake news. The fake news, everybody. They are fake. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation, right? To give our workers and businesses a level playing field, Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country. Better vote for Karin.
They want to take them away. They want to take them away. We've taken historic action to make health care more affordable and we've gotten rid of the soaring premiums. You know, the premiums on Obamacare -- nobody realized it. They were going up 116 percent, 138 percent, 200 percent. Through great management and great people, we've kept them down.
We've mostly obliterated Obamacare, although we had it won except for 2 o'clock in the morning -- I say it again -- 2 o'clock in the morning and I was like -- I'm not going to do it. Two o'clock in the morning. But think of it differently: We didn't get one Democrat vote so we're stuck with it, but it's obliterated.
And the big thing is, we got rid of the most unpopular part of Obamacare. It's called the individual mandate, where you have the privilege of paying a fortune so that you don't have to pay a fortune for horrible health care, right? So, the premiums in Minnesota this year are coming down by double digits.
Think of that. And I don't even like this stuff, but while we have the remnants of Obamacare, we're working to make it much more affordable than you had. And to reduce drug prices, the FDA has approved a record number of affordable generic medicines. And that's not all. Drug prices are coming down. You might have seen last month where I called up some of the drug companies.
I said, "Folks, you just raised up the drug prices. You can't do that." And they all reduced them. Do you believe it? That's when I said, "I've a lot of power." Pfizer, right? You saw that. Pfizer, Novartis, they raised their drug prices and I'm bringing them down. I said, "What are you doing with raising them?" "I'm sorry, Mr. President, we'll reduce them immediately." I said, "Man, this is a powerful position.
I never..." First time in the history of drug companies that they've done that. They literally announced it. I called them the next day. I told them I was extremely unhappy and they said, "We're going to reduce it." Who the hell does that? Do you think Hillary Clinton would have done that? [Audience Responds No] I don't think so. I don't think so. [Audience Chants Lock her up] By the way, she or whoever it might have been, crazy Bernie, whoever they put in, they wouldn't have done any of the things -- we did the greatest trade deal.
Look at the money. We did 4.2 percent GDP. They were going down. They would have had a minus four point. They -- they said 4.2 percent is impossible. It's going to go higher, much higher. We have such potential. Between military and trade deals, we have hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fat and potential.
And what I love -- what I love, hopefully you don't need it for a long time or never, to help critically ill patients get life-saving treatments, we passed Right to Try. I love it. I hope you don't need it. I hope I don't need it, too. I hope you don't need it. But that's -- you know, we have the greatest -- frankly, the greatest drug companies in the world.
And we would have drugs that would take four or five years -- you know, we've brought it down from 14 years to get approved down to four. I think we'll be at three or two. But still, you've got to wait a long time. And a person who is dying, a person is terminally ill and they have a great, you know, possible cure, and so a person wants to see if they could possibly -- you couldn't get it. There was no way of getting it. No way in a million years.
I worked with Congress, including these guys and... and Greg. And Greg, right? And Jim and Mark and the whole group. But we worked with Congress and we got it done. I love the name, Right to Try. Now, they can go, they sign a paper. You have no idea: They've been trying to get this for 40 years. You know, who would think?
They've been trying for 40 years. And it is, you have problems with insurance companies. You have problems with trials. You have problems with so many different things. You have problems with everything. Everything is there -- and you have problems with liability. I said, "Sign a document that there's no liability." They don't want to give something, the person dies and then the family sues the country.
That's no good. So you sign away your rights if you take it. And you know what happened? Everybody said, "Wow, that's a good idea." Can you believe this? So after 40 years, we have it. And now people are trying it. And you know what? We've had some incredible results. And it's also telling you whether or not this stuff works.
There's something good about that, too. We've had some incredible results, right? I love it. People would fly to other continents, they'd fly to other countries. If they were poor they'd just go away. They'd had no hope. They'd go to their house or their apartment and they'd have no hope. Now, they have hope.
It's beautiful. It's so great. We also passed Veterans Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor... see a private doctor instead of waiting in line. I mean, we had people waiting for three weeks, two weeks, 12 days, nine weeks. We had people that were not very sick. It took them so long to see the private doctor, to see a doctor, a veterans doctor -- and they're good doctors.
We really do, we have great doctors -- but it's a long process. So they're not very sick. By the time they'd see the doctor 22 days later, they'd be terminally ill. Think of it. They would die. They would die on line waiting. They now have the right to go to a private doctor and we pay the bill. Forty-four years they've been trying to get it. I thought that was my idea.
I came back, "I got the greatest idea." I said to all my medical people, "I got the greatest idea. It's taken too long. We could never solve this problem. Too many people, too few doctors. They're great doctors, but you can't get to them. I got the greatest -- we're going to have the people go to a private doctor and we're going to pay for it." And they said, "Sir, we've been working on this for 44 years." But I got it approved because I'm good at getting things approved, right?
Right? All done. All done. And these people helped me. Right there. They helped me with it. Right there. And we also passed landmark V.A. accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable. We say, "Jim, you're fired. Out. Get out. Get out." We had no right to do it. Between the unions and the civil servants, they could do anything.
They could be sadists -- and they were. They were sadists. These are sick people. They -- they could be sadists. They could be stealing. They could be robbing you blind. They could be doing anything. You couldn't fire them. They were totally protected. Now, you just fire them. Get them out. We have secured a record $716 billion to rebuild our military and give our brave warriors their largest pay raise in a decade.
And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working -- I'm so excited about this -- to create the sixth branch, number six, of the American armed forces, called the Space Force. We have the Air Force. Now we have the Space Force. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear disaster deal.
And we've opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Presidents have been promising that for many, many decades and I finally know why, because I was hit so hard when they heard I was going to do it. I got calls from every country in the world. "Please, don't do it." And I told you the story. I said, "Look, I don't want to take any calls from any leaders of any countries.
Tell them I'll call them back." We were going to have it signed on a Monday. Big ceremony. I said, "Tell them I'll call them back next week." [Laughter] Because they were calling me and they were saying, "Mr. President, please don't do that. Please. Please." So I know why Obama and Bush and everybody didn't do it. I mean, I understand.
There was a lot of pressure put on them. So I just said, "Tell them I'll call them back next week." So on Monday I signed it, and then on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday I called everybody back. "Hi, how are you doing? What's up?" [Laughter] "Well, we didn't want you to do..." I said, "Oh, I'm sorry. Gee, it's too late." I said, "What can I do? What can I do?" "What can I do?" For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America.
Now you have a president who is standing up for America... more than ever before. [Audience Chants USA] We're standing up for your values, we're standing up for Minnesota and we are standing proudly for our national anthem. All right. I'll give you a quick story that they don't know. They've never heard.
It's hard to believe; I thought they knew everything about me. So in making the deal with Mexico and then Canada, -- as you know, Canada was very tough, but that they worked out fine. And the NFL -- because we talk about the flag and the -- I'm not happy about it with the NFL. OK? I'm not happy, if it's OK with you guys -- is it OK with you?
Not happy. People should stand proudly for our national anthem and for our flag. So I'm not happy. I'm not happy. But that seems to be working out. Do you notice? That's seems to be working out very good. But to show you -- so we're making the deal with Canada. And it's big stuff. You know, it's cars and it's farming and it's agriculture and it's factories and it's big, big dollars.
Tremendous. They say it's the largest trade deal ever made, $1.3 trillion. But I heard that the NFL had a big problem with Canada on their advertising, on the commercials. A big, big problem. I'm not going to get into what it was, but it was a very bad problem and it went on for years and it was really hurting the NFL. Now, I don't care.
I like some of the people. I don't like some of the -- it doesn't matter. It's an American company. It's a great American company. So during the negotiation I said, "You've got to fix the NFL problem." They said, "What?" I said, "You've got to fix the NFL problem." Took me two minutes and now the NFL is so happy it's all worked out.
It's all worked out. They don't know that. It's all worked out. We've got to fix it. And now our country will be taking tens of millions of dollars more money. It's going to go -- a lot of it's going to go to the players and they'll still hate me. Can you believe it? But you know what? Think of it. It took me two minutes.
You've got to fix the problem. It's because -- not because I love them or don't like them. I do like them. It's a great American company. I said, "You've got to fix the NFL problem. It's unfair what you do to them during the Super Bowls. Very unfair." And I got a call from Roger Goodell. No, very nice. And I figured he was calling about the flag.
Like, to say, "Could you leave us alone, please?" [Laughter] And he wasn't. He said, "Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for what you did. You solved a problem that was going on for years." The Obama administration couldn't do it. Nobody could do it. Nobody could get it done. I did it in two minutes. It was like, "You've got to do it. We've got to do it." It was a tiny, little part of the deal.
I figured, "What the hell? It was like two sentences." But it was very nice. Roger Goodell called me and then Bob Kraft, who owns -- who's a great owner. Now, it's great to have Coach Belichick and Tom Brady, that's a good thing, right? I always say, "Bob, you're a great owner and you're one of the luckiest men on Earth.
You took Tom Brady in the sixth round, right? And you have the greatest coach in football." That's a good thing and he's a great guy. But he called me to thank me and Roger Goodell called to thank me. Very nice. And we're all friends. I want what's good for the country. People said to me... True. One of my killers called up. We have very tough negotiators, very smart guys.
We have, like, the A Team of the world. And he said, "You know, we could have that -- that NFL thing. I heard about it for years." Everybody heard about it, what they were doing. I said -- I said -- they said, "You know, I think we could fix that NFL deal for you." I said, "Let's fix it." They said, "Really?
You want to do that?" I said, "No. They're a great American company. They're going to pay tax on that money. They're going to pay the money to people that work and live in our country. Fix the deal." They were surprised. I said, "Fix it." They fixed it and it was a nice thing. OK, enough of that. That's enough of that.
True. So the NFL, good company, great, great people. We're lifting millions of our citizens -- and you know this -- from welfare to work, from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. And a lot of people are coming out of prisons and they're able to get jobs now.
Isn't that great? They're getting a second chance and even a third chance and they're getting jobs. And people that are hiring many of these prisoners are saying unbelievable how good they are. It's so beautiful to see. And before, they wouldn't have a chance. People didn't want to hire them. They're hiring people coming out of prison and these people are stepping up. I have a friend that hired many, quite a few, and he said, "I can't say every one," but he said, "These people are unbelievable.
They're so hard-working. We've given them a second chance." It's a -- to me, it's a beautiful thing. But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends and get your family and get your neighbors and your coworkers and get out, and you have to -- November 6th, you have to go out and vote Republican.
Send Jason Lewis and Jim Hagedorn to the House. And vote to send Karin Housley... Get Karin Housley into the Senate. We need her. We need her vote. We need her. She's going to be fantastic. Forget about Tina. Karin, they're going to get you in. A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation and more products made right here in the good old USA. That's what we want.
It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our Constitution, and to love and respect the heroes of law enforcement. Great. They're great. They're great people. No easy job. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, division and destruction -- it's destruction -- and to unite together as citizens, as patriots and as Americans.
To everyone in this beautiful, big, rich room, to every citizen watching across our land, this is your time to choose. It's a time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past, or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness. It's not up to the media or to the pundits to decide your fate.
It's up to you. This was the greatest movement, 2016, all of those hats, Make America Great Again. Look at them. Amazing. Amazing. It's the greatest movement in the history of our country. It is. I mean, there's never been a movement like this. There's never been a movement like this. As an example, the presidential election is not for two and a half years.
Look at this room. Look at this. Look outside. This is not a normal situation. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country and they know it. And they don't even challenge me when I say it, because if I was wrong, there would be headlines. "Donald Trump..." [Laughter] It's up to the proud people of our country and the very proud people of Minnesota, a great state.
You have the power with your votes to defend America's honor and reclaim America's future. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. Together, we are taking back our country, returning power to the American people. This state was settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women... who braved the wilderness to build a life and to build a home.
They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country and they loved their god. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to tear down their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage.
For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children, we are going to work, we are going to fight and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory.
Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together we will make America wealthy again... make America strong again... we will make America safe again... and we will make America great again. Thank you, Minnesota. Thank you. Thank you.
Hello, Mississippi, hello. Beautiful. [Audience Chants USA] Well, I have to start by saying that 2020 is looking really easy, isn't it? I think the fake news media back there is starting to get it, folks. I think they're starting. They're starting to understand what's going on. And I'm thrilled to be back in this great state, with thousands of proud, loyal, hard-working American patriots.
Thank you. In less than two years, we've achieved the biggest comeback in American history. That's what's happened. The economy is booming. Wages are rising. And more Americans are working today than ever before. Today -- ever before. Think of it. Now, just think of that. Today, we have more Americans working than we've ever had in the history of our country, right now, today.
How great is that, right? We're defending our Second Amendment, protecting religious liberty, taking care of our great veterans... and rebuilding America's military like it hasn't been rebuilt ever before. This week, we made history again when I announced that we are replacing the job-killed disaster known as NAFTA with a brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.
A good one. And it's a good one. We're calling it USMCA. You're going to like that name. That'll become a part of your vocabulary. USMCA. Companies aren't going to be leaving us anymore and firing everybody and sending their product back into the United States with no tax. That was what I wanted. You know, Mississippi, when they leave and they go next door and they fire everybody and they build the product and send it back and sell it to the same people that were buying it before -- no, we don't want to do that anymore.
No we don't want to do that anymore. It's not a good -- that's not a good thing to do. Although there is a group called globalists. They think it's just fine. Not fine. They're globalists. [Inaudible] globalists. We don't like the thinking of the globalists. The USMCA is an incredible victory for our farmers, our ranchers, our factory workers, and our entire nation.
America is winning again, and America is being respected again, maybe respected like never before, because we are finally putting America first. But exactly five weeks from today, all of this extraordinary progress is at stake. It is at stake. I'm not on the ballot, but in a certain way, I'm on the ballot, so please go out and vote.
Go out and vote. On November 6th, you will head to the polls -- hopefully -- in one of the most important congressional elections of our lifetime. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. A Democrat takeover of Congress will plunge our country into gridlock and chaos like you haven't seen before.
It'll come to a halt. And I have to tell you, all of those people, with your savings accounts and your money piled up in your bank, it's all -- a lot of it's going to disappear, and it'll disappear really fast. Your 401(k)s -- I stand up all the time with great Americans. "Sir, I'd like to thank you. My wife thinks I'm one of the greatest investors in the world.
And two years ago, she thought I was a total loser, sir. Now she loves me so much." "Because my 401(k)..." "... has gone up 55 percent, sir, since you got elected! 55 percent!" Ah, it's amazing. You can really get your wife to like you a lot when that happens. You've got to be really bad. I'll tell you. And that's happening.
And it goes the other way, too. That happens. People are geniuses now. And we've helped. You know, we had probably -- and even the fake news would tell you -- the greatest victory in the history of this country in 2016. There's never been anything like that. The people came from the hills and the valleys.
They came from all over. And they voted, voted, voted. And they love Trump, and they loved us. Because it wasn't me, it was all of us. It was all of us. And that's what's happening. That's what's happening. But it's all fragile. The Democrats will open our borders to deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. The Democrats -- and I say this -- and I've dealt with it -- the Democrats are the party of crime.
And that's what it is, they're the party of crime. Radical Democrats want to tear down our laws, tear down our institutions in pursuit of power, demolish our prosperity in the name of socialism and probably worse... and abolish our borders in the service of globalism. There is nothing Democrats aren't willing to do, and you're seeing it day by day, and you've seen it more the last week than you've ever seen it before.
And no one -- just think of this. No one under any circumstances is allowed to speak up if you're on this side of the equation. But guess what? We're speaking up like nobody has ever spoken up before. They want to get the power that they so desperately crave that was taken away from them. All of the Democrats know and all they really know how to do is obstruct, resist, demolish, destroy and delay.
They've been trying to destroy Judge Kavanaugh since the very first second he was announced... because they know Judge Kavanaugh will follow the Constitution as written. [Audience Chants We Want Kavanaugh] You know, for 10 years, I don't know him, I never met him, but I'd been hearing there's this guy named Brett Kavanaugh who is... who is like a perfect person, who is destined for the Supreme Court.
I've heard that for a long time. And -- a lot of smart people. And first in his class at Yale. Top, top in his class at Yale Law School. He'd led, like, a life that's unbelievable. He's had no problems. They've never taken him out of restaurants. They've never -- this is like a person that everybody thought at the highest level on both sides, they said, "Someday he will be a Supreme Court judge." Right?
He will be a justice of the Supreme Court. And all my life, I've heard that the most important thing that a president has to do as president is the appointment of a Supreme Court justice and... And I disagree. I think war. I think our military. I think peace. I think those things are -- you know, those things are pretty important, right?
That's pretty important. They don't say that, but I say those things are pretty important. But I'll have to tell you, the appointment of a Supreme Court justice -- and I look at him, and I looked at the man that we appointed just before him, Justice Neil Gorsuch... who was put through the paces, but nothing like what's happening now.
It's just crazed. It's crazy. What's happening now, they had gang rape. A gang rape. Many times. Well, that turned out to be false. So many different charges. Guilty until proven innocent. That's very dangerous for our country. That's very dangerous for our country. And I have it myself all the time. But for me, it's like a part of the job description.
[Laughter] Let it happen to me. Shouldn't happen to him. Shouldn't happen to him. What he's going through: 36 years ago, this happened. "I had one beer." Right? "I had one beer." "Well, you think it was..." "Nope, it was one beer." "Oh, good. How did you get home?" "I don't remember." "How did you get there?" "I don't remember." "Where is the place?" "I don't remember." "How many years ago was it?" "I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know." "I don't know." "What neighborhood was it in?" "I don't know." "Where's the house?" "I don't know." "Upstairs, downstairs, where was it?" "I don't know. But I had one beer, that's the only thing I remember." And a man's life is in tatters. A man's life is shattered. His wife is shattered.
His daughters, who are beautiful, incredible young kids -- they destroy people. They want to destroy people. These are really evil people. And then you see... And then you see the people that are doing it. I know every one. I could tell you things about every one of them. Da Nang Richard Blumenthal. This guy lied about his service.
He didn't just say, "Gee, I was in the service." No. He said, "I was in the Marines. Da Nang Province. Soldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill." This went on for 15 years when he was the attorney general of Connecticut. I thought he was a great war hero. And then it turned out he was never in Vietnam.
He was in the Reserves! And I watched him two days ago. I watched him saying, "We need the truth. If we don't have" -- and here's a guy who was saying people were dying all around him and he was never there. And then he cried. When they caught him, he cried like a baby. [Laughter] Like a baby. When Jimmy Swaggart cried, it was nothing compared to Da Nang Richard.
Nothing. Jimmy Swaggart was nothing compared to -- he cried, "Oh, oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so" -- he only lied for 15 years. And now we get something. And now he talks about lying. And this man's not lying. So Blumenthal is a fraud. He's a fraud. And the reason he got elected is because in Connecticut it's impossible for a Republican to get elected.
And I did well there. But you can't. He actually gave up the race. You'd thought he lost. You remember that? He, sort of, gave -- he stopped campaigning. It was over. And then he won by three points. And we have him in the Senate. And now he's this great honorable guy, because you know why? The fake news doesn't ever want to put that stuff on. They don't want to talk about it. They don't ever want to put it on. They're a bunch of fakers.
And then you have Cory Booker, right? Cory Booker. Here's a guy who destroyed practically by himself the city of Newark, New Jersey. He was such a bad mayor. And see what he wrote himself about women. Check it out, folks. Check it out. Then he talks -- "How dare you treat a woman like that." Take a look at what this guy wrote.
And I know about every one of them. I could go on and on. How about Feinstein? How about her? "We need more time for the FBI. The FBI has to do a more thorough search. We had another woman just reported by a sleazebag lawyer named Avenatti." Sleazebag. Sleazebag. We have -- well, it turned out even NBC, who's as bad as they get -- even NBC couldn't shield her with that interview.
Did you see that interview? This woman had no clue what was going on. No clue. And yet she made the most horrible charges against a number one in his class at Yale, perfect human being, great father, great husband. This is a great person. And people are saying, "Well, maybe it's true. And because of the fact that maybe it's true he should not become a United States Supreme Court justice." How horrible is this?
How horrible is this? So this is an important time for our country. This is a time when your father, when your husband, when your brother, when your son could do great. "Mom, I did great in school. I've worked so hard. Mom, I'm so pleased to tell you, I just got a fantastic job with IBM. I just got a fantastic job with General Motors.
I just got -- I'm so proud." "Mom, a terrible thing just happened. A person who I've never met said that I did things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job, Mom. I don't know what to do. Mom, what do I do? What do I do, Mom? What do I do, Mom?" It's a damn sad situation, OK? But we better start as a country getting smart and getting tough and not letting that stuff right back there, all those cameras, tell us how to live our lives.
Because they are really dishonest people. Not all of them, but damn well most of them. That I can tell you. Fake news. So that's something to think about, right? That's something -- think of your son. Think of your husband. Think -- I've had many false accusations. I've had it all the -- I've had so many -- and when I say it didn't happen, nobody believes me. But it's me. It's my job description.
Mr. Trump, it's OK, you can say whatever you want. They can say whatever they want about me. It's fine, because we have the worst libel laws anywhere in the world. They can say anything they want, and we can't sue them, because if you're famous, you can't sue. Figure that one out. But to take people that are just outstanding and have had great lives, and that life doesn't mean a thing.
And do you notice with the judge, they don't talk about his last 35 years? They don't talk about what -- everybody knows him. He's a very well-known and most highly respected person until the last couple of weeks, because they're destroying him and they're destroying his reputation. And we can't let that happen.
We can't. Can't let it happen. And I don't even know him, folks. I don't even know him. I met him for the first time a few weeks ago. I don't even know him. So it's not like, "Oh, gee, I want to protect my friend." I want to do what's right for this country. This is a very important time in our country... OK? Very important thing.
Very important time in our country. The Democrat Party has become too extreme -- this is an example of it -- and too dangerous to be trusted with power. That is why you must vote Republican on Election Day, and you have to go out and vote. You know, I'm listening to commentators, and they say, "If Trump were running, he's going to beat everybody." They're saying that.
You know, it's hard for them to admit that. And I certainly dream about all these people. Biden, the guy never had more than 1 percent in a poll when he was running for president, and then Obama took him off the trash heap, right? Biden -- I hear Biden wants to take me to the back of a barn. He would be in big trouble, I will tell you.
Remember he said that? "I'd like to take him." You know, with Biden, you go like this -- whew -- and he goes down. [Laughter] Biden. And the other ones. But they say that, "Donald Trump isn't running, so will the people go out and vote in three weeks?" You got to go out and vote. And they say, "But Donald Trump doesn't like Congress." I really do. I like a lot of the people in Congress.
Some I'm disappointed in, but for the most part -- and I have to tell you something: We have the right ideas. We're making our country great again. We're doing the right thing. We need more Republican votes. They say we have a majority. We barely have -- if somebody has a cold and stays home, we don't have a majority.
That's how bad it is. Republicans have to go out and vote. And they say if I was on the ticket, everybody would go, it would be a landslide. Even the fakers back there, they say that. And I'm not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket. Because this is also a referendum about me and the disgusting gridlock that they'll put this country through.
Think of it. We have the greatest economy in history. We have a military that will soon be the strongest we've ever had. Our country is doing so well. And then we have a Maxine Waters saying, "We have to get rid of him. We have to get rid of him!" Maxine Waters. And Nancy Pelosi. She's another beauty. Get out and vote!
I want you to vote. Pretend I'm on the ballot. And don't worry, we'll be on the ballot in two years, and we will do a landslide like you haven't -- like you wouldn't believe. A couple of the reporters I see back there, they said, "Oh, Trump is running." And I must say, one of them said, right after I announced, June 16th -- right after I announced, there was a Sunday morning show.
And one of them said, "You know he's going to win, don't you?" And another one, who's back there now, who's looking very well, said, along with the host, "Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, you're only kidding. He's just doing this for fun." You think this is fun? Yeah, actually, it's sort of fun. I guess it is. For me, it's fun.
For me, it's fun. You know why it's fun? Because we're achieving our goals better than anyone thought possible. That's why it's fun. If I wasn't, it wouldn't be fun. But this one particular reporter, she said, "Ho, ho, ho, you're only kidding, right? Ha, ha, that's so funny." And I'll never forget on election night, "Donald Trump is your next president, folks." And it's driving them crazy.
So, we're thrilled to be here tonight, and I am having a lot of fun. But it is true: I'm having fun because nobody ever would have believed in a million years that we would have accomplished what we've accomplished. Nobody has accomplished more in two years. You take a look at the first two years of any -- nobody has even come close to accomplishing what we've accomplished.
And I'm doing it for you, and we're doing it together, because this is a whole thing that has never happened in our country before. You know, it's interesting, when we first started, there were a lot of people who were showing up. And by the way, you think this is a big crowd in here? This place is packed, right?
Right? And if there was one empty seat, they would say, as the Washington Post did say -- the Washington Post came -- you saw that, right? -- came to an arena someplace four hours early and they hadn't started letting the people in yet. And he put a picture of an empty arena. There were tens of thousands of people outside waiting to come in. The Washington Post put a picture of an empty arena, and they put a caption to the effect, "Mr. President, not a very good crowd, is it?" And you know what happened?
And they had a picture up of an empty arena like I was a -- I didn't even land for four and a half hours later. And when I landed, that place was just like this. It was packed with thousands of people outside. Now, did they fire that reporter? No. Did they fire that reporter? No. Right? They -- isn't it incredible?
Isn't it sad? And look what happened to Roseanne. Did they fire Roseanne? Yes. No, but think of it. Puts a picture of an empty -- like it had 5 percent. People were just starting to trickle in. And said, "Not a very good crowd, Mr. President." There was no games. You know what happened that night? People that were sitting on stairwells, people that couldn't get a seat, people that were here only cause the fire marshals were so incredible, that shouldn't have even been allowed to come in, with thousands outside, they said, "This is a fraud by the Washington Post." I was there.
There were no empty seats. We set a record that evening for crowd attendance. Because we don't need much of a stage. Basketball, they need a big -- you're filled up with people, like it is tonight. And we barely got an apology. And he admitted he was wrong. You know where he did it? On his little Twitter account.
[Laughter] And that kind of dishonesty happens all the time. Happened at the inauguration. It happened at the inauguration. It happens all the time. These are very, very dishonest people. We are thrilled to be joined tonight by several great Republican leaders. And we're going to start with a friend of mine who is a very special man, very special.
He's a great governor. Done a fantastic job. He called me. He built the African-American Museum. Called me. We went there. It was so beautiful. We had -- I was at the opening. We cut the ribbon! Governor Phil Bryant. Governor. Thank you, Phil. Thank you, Phil. Should we bring Phil up here? He's been so -- come on. Get up here, Phil.
Come, come, come. Come on, Phil, get up here. What a great governor he's been. Look at this guy. Is he central casting or what? Is he -- look at this. He's central casting. But you know where he's really good? His heart and his brain. Great brain and great heart. Seriously.
Thank you! Are we proud to have Donald J. Trump here in Mississippi? All right, I don't want to get started, but I can tell you what. This man has done more as president of the United States in two years than any president that I can ever remember or ever studied about. He is a remarkable man that is making America great again! [Audience Chants USA]
Thank you very much, Phil. Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves. Tate? Tate? Where is Tate? Thanks, Tate. Doing a good job. And Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann. Delbert? Thank you. Thank you. And I want to thank your members of Congress that are here, because they've been warriors, they've been friends.
They helped me with the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country... the biggest tax reform, the great regulation cuts, which could be even more important, frankly, than the tax cuts, if you want to know the truth, because it means jobs. But you have some great -- Congressman Trent Kelly. Trent, thank you.
Gregg Harper. Thank you very much. And David Kustoff. Thank you, David. There's another warrior in the room. These are warriors. Look, the abuse they take, the abuse we all take, if you're not a warrior, you just go home, go to the corner, put your thumb in your mouth and say, "Mommy, take me home." You got to be a warrior.
And a guy who is a wonderful friend of mine and has always been there for me, Senator Roger Wicker. Roger? What a great -- and Mrs. Wicker, thank you. What a great guy. And he's doing great. Get out and vote for him, anyway. He's winning by a lot, but get out there and vote. We love Roger. Finally, I want to introduce the person we are all here tonight to support, a true Mississippi patriot, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. Come on up. Cindy, come up.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. And I told him he would get a warm Mississippi welcome, and you did not disappoint. Yes! We are the Hospitality State, Mr. President. And I tell you, it is such an honor to work with this man. Is he not the best president we have ever had? This is wonderful.
You know, early on, I was a supporter of then-candidate Donald J. Trump, and I was on his ag advisory committee. And now every time I walk onto the Senate floor, I want to help President Donald J. Trump. It is such an honor to work with a man that, I'll tell you, he loves the veterans, he loves the military, and he loves our law enforcement, as well.
You know, this past week -- this past week in Brookhaven, Mississippi, my hometown, we had two officers shot down this past weekend. And I was able to tell him about that, James White and Zack Moak. And then the next day, we had a Mississippi Highway Patrol trooper, Josh Smith, shot down. And I'm just going to ask you to remember those people in your prayers as we continue on with this.
We've had a tragic week in Mississippi with our law enforcement, but this man supports law enforcement 100 percent. I just want to thank our great governor, Phil Bryant, for making me your U.S. senator, to appoint me to that, an opportunity of three lifetimes. Other than being the mother of Anna Michael Smith and the husband of Mike Smith, it is the greatest honor of my life.
And what a treat to serve with Senator Roger Wicker. When I tell you he's been a friend, he has been a friend to me on the Senate floor, no doubt. I tell you, you know, when I was sworn in as your U.S. senator, Vice President Mike Pence, he put this pin right here on me, and he said, "Cindy, this pin will get you in any door in Washington, D.C." But I want you to know, this isn't my pin.
This is your pin. This is Mississippi's pin. We've got a lot of work to do in Washington, D.C. This man is leading the charge. We're going to get back on Air Force One, and we're going back to Washington, because you know what? We've got a Supreme Court justice to get confirmed! We got to. So I'm going to ask for your prayers, also, for the Kavanaugh family.
And I'll tell you tonight, my true prayer is God will continue to bless these great state  of the United States!
Thank you, Cindy. [Audience Chants USA] Thank you, Cindy. Great. You know we had a great friend who was senator, and did a fantastic job, and it was just his time. He called me, it was his time. And you know who I'm talking about, wonderful man. And he said, "You're going to have to appoint somebody." And I went to Phil.
I said, "Phil, who's the best?" And Phil had no doubt in his mind. That's who he recommended. And since then, Cindy has voted with me 100 percent of the time. She's always had my back. She's always had your back. And a vote for Cindy is a vote for me and make America great again. And a vote for Cindy's opponent, Mike Espy, is a vote for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi... and the legendary low-IQ person Maxine Waters.
That's why Schumer's PAC is funding Mike Espy with a lot of money. A vote for Espy is a vote for the Democrat agenda to open borders and for radical socialism. When Espy was in Congress, he even sponsored legislation alongside Nancy Pelosi to provide taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens. Oh, that's great.
That's just what Mississippi wants. I don't think that works in Mississippi. Does that work? I don't think so. I don't think so. Your vote in this election will decide which party controls the United States Senate. It's very important. Very important. And that's a great woman. That's a great woman. Gotten to know her very well over the last number of months.
If Democrats get control, they will raise your taxes, flood your streets with criminal aliens, weaken our military, outlaw private health insurance, and replace freedom with socialism. In a short period of time -- of course, I'll be doing lots of vetoes, just so don't worry too much -- they will turn America into Venezuela.
How's that working out? And our country will never be Venezuela. We won't let that happen. If Democrats get 51 seats, the key Senate committees will be run by the far left Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. It's amazing that he wasn't more angry that the election got stolen from him, right? I don't get it. You know, he's always like complaining, complaining.
He's jumping around. The hair's going crazy. The hair's going crazy. He's jumping like a lunatic. But he never complained about the fact that crooked Hillary cheated him out of the election. It's amazing. It's amazing. [Audience Chants Lock Her Up] You know, Bernie was on television recently. And he was screaming and ranting and raving.
And I said to my wife, Melania, who's now in Africa representing us, first lady... I watched her get off that plane this morning in Africa. And so beautiful. And she was hugging and kissing children. It was beautiful to see. She's doing a great job as first lady, I will tell you. Really great. And you think that's an easy job?
That's not an easy job. That's a tough job. She's fantastic. But Bernie Sanders was ranting and raving and "We're going to this" and "Trump and Trump and we got to stop" -- what he's going to stop? Having a strong military? Having low taxes? Having borders? What's he going to stop? What am I doing? What's he going to stop?
Having less regulation? But he's going to stop Trump. He's going to stop Trump. He's going to stop us left and right. He's ranting and raving. And the commentator looks at him and goes, "You know he's winning, don't you?" And Bernie just looked at him like this. It was like -- but I said to my -- you got to hand it to him.
You know, he's out there. He's doing his thing, whether you like it or not. He's out there doing his thing, and you've got to hand it to him. But a guy like Bernie would be in charge of the Budget Committee. Patrick Leahy -- oh, he's never had a drink in his life. [Laughter] Check it out. Look under "Patrick Leahy/drink." [Laughter] "How dare you have a beer while you're in high school?
How dare." "Patrick Leahy-drink" will be in charge of the Appropriations Committee. Bob Menendez -- you don't know about him -- will be in -- I'll leave him alone, because we can't cover too many of these characters, right? But I'm going to leave him alone -- will be in charge of Foreign Affairs. And the great Dianne Feinstein... will be in charge of the Judiciary Committee.
No. Wasn't that great? Wasn't that great? Wasn't that something the other day? She was asked a simple question, "Did you leak the document?" -- wasn't that great? -- by John Cornyn. He goes, "You leaked the document." "No. What? No." "Uh, remember?" "No. Oh, no, I didn't. No, I don't think I -- well, wait.
Did we leak the document? No." [Laughter] "How about the aide?" "No, you idiot! No!" [Laughter] "No, we didn't leak the document. We didn't leak the document. No, we didn't." That was the worst body language that I've ever seen. Oh, what a group. What a group. Holier than thou, aren't they? Holier than thou.
You know the expression, right? What a group. Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Democrats in Washington want to raid Medicare to pay for their socialist agenda. They're going to destroy it. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and paid for it, right? Right? And we will always protect Americans with pre-existing location.
We're going to have to do that. Pre-existing conditions. We have to take care of pre-existing conditions, because it's just the way life is, folks. We have to do that. And the Democrats are talking about it and they can't do it, because they have no plan. So just put it down. And some Republicans say, "Is that a Republican thing?" Whether it is or not -- and to me it is, and it always will be -- pre-existing conditions will always be taken care of by us. Have to do it. We have to do it. We have to do it, and we want to do it. I want to do it. We're all going to do it. We're doing well.
We'll take it from China. We'll take it from the European Union, who has taken advantage of us for years. We'll take it from Japan. We'll take it from our new, beautiful transaction, which is a fair transaction, and good for them, too, Mexico, Canada. We're going to have plenty of money coming in, folks, when we fix up these horrible trade deals.
So we're going to take care of pre-existing conditions. People that have a problem are going to be helped by the Republican Party from -- from the time I got elected, really. You look at what we've done with Obamacare. It's a disaster. We had it beaten. But I'll say it a different way than I have been saying it. We didn't get one Democrat vote.
We had it repealed and replaced. A little shocked took place early in the morning. But the fact is, we didn't get one Democrat vote. We would have saved a trillion dollars -- think of it -- our country would have saved $1 trillion had we gotten that extra vote. We didn't get one vote from one Democrat. But we've pretty much dismantled it. And here's a nice story.
We've managed it well. And your premiums have gone up very little by -- remember, they were going up 156, 201, 187, 116 percent? Now we have it down. But we're getting rid of it entirely. We're going to have great health care. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE -- the brave, brave people of ICE.
In other words, they want to abolish immigration enforcement entirely. That's what they want to do. Democrats also support strongly sanctuary cities of death. Sanctuary cities. Every day, sanctuary cities are unleashing vicious predators and bloodthirsty killers, like MS-13, into our communities. They go out and they hide out in sanctuary cities.
Then they come into our cities and our towns. And then we send ICE in, and ICE has no problem. You know why? Because ICE is much tougher and much smarter than them. And ICE has done an incredible job. And they grab them by the neck and they throw them the hell out of our country or they throw them into jail.
And you don't want that job. And you don't want that job. And you don't even want -- although maybe you could handle that job, right? But they do a fantastic job. And we have to cherish our law enforcement. And that goes for Border Patrol, that goes for ICE. We're setting records on the border on arrests.
We don't want to do that. We're building the wall. It's going up. But getting money is brutal -- brutal. [Audience Chants Build the Wall] So we've started the wall. And we've done a lot in California and elsewhere -- San Diego. We're moving eastward, and we're covering a lot of territory. They gave us $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and another $1.6 billion.
I want the whole thing, because we can do the whole damn wall, and we can do a great one in one year. But getting money from the Democrats is tough, because they know that's a big issue for us. And they know we need it. Most of them voted for it in 2006. I don't know if you know that. Most of them. But, of course, you have to have a wall.
You have people pouring across. They're tackling people. And then, of course, they have catch and release. You catch somebody. "Who is this person?" "It's a criminal." "Oh, that's OK. Catch, take his name and release the person." And the person they think will come back to court. We have the dumbest immigration laws in the whole world.
Watch what happens over the next couple of weeks, folks. Watch. Watch. And it's all because of the Democrats. Every Republican wants some change. But they stop you. The only thing they're good at -- they're lousy politicians. They're horrible in policy. They don't know what the hell they're doing. They're only good at one thing: resisting.
They're good at sticking together. You rarely see them break up. They stick like glue. They stick. That's the only thing they're good at: delay and resist. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. If you want security, if you want a strong border, if you want to have a country that is a great, great, safe country, then you need to go out and you need to vote Republican.
Have to do it. And everybody. This election in November is about safety and it's also about prosperity. They're going to take your wealth away from you. They're going to take your wealth away. All of that we've done with the jobs and the salaries and the wages that are rising for the first time in 21 years, they're going to take it away from you so fast.
Since the election, we have created over 4 million new jobs. Unheard of. Unheard of! Unheard of! And lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. That's a big thing. We've added nearly 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. You remember when the previous administration said, "Oh, you can't do manufacturing"? I said, "Really, who's going to build things?" They said, "You won't add any." They said you needed a magic wand, remember?
A magic wand. We don't have a magic wand. We've got good policy. We've got good leadership. We have a lot of good leaders in our party. And you've heard this many times over the last three weeks: African-American unemployment has reached its lowest rate ever recorded -- ever! Ever! Remember "What do you have to lose?" What do you have to lose, right?
What do you have to lose? I said. And people said, "Oh, that's not nice." But I said, "Wait, they have the worst crime rate. They have the worst schools. They have the worst homeownership percentages. They have the" -- I went through a list of 10 different things. And I looked up, and they've always voted for Democrats, the African-Americans, 95, more, percent.
And I looked up and I said, "What the hell do you have to lose?" Remember? And now... Not only do they have the lowest unemployment rate in history, but African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate also ever recorded. It's a great thing, right? So -- and we've just started. We've just started. Remember, same true for Hispanic Americans, the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded.
Same for Asian Americans, lowest unemployment rate ever recorded. Women, lowest unemployment rate in 65 years. After years and years of working so hard, we finally put ourselves in a position where we can do things. And we can really do them. But we could do them an awfully lot better if we had more -- a real majority, not a majority of one, not a majority of literally if somebody's sick, it's like we have to postpone votes.
We need a real majority, and we're going to do everything that you've been looking for for a long time. You know, with that being said, we've done so much. We've done so much. We've just finalized the tremendous new trade agreement with South Korea, where it was a disaster. That was a Hillary Clinton catastrophe.
Remember she said, "We are going to create 250,000 new jobs"? And she was right, for South Korea. It was good. [Laughter] And we've just totally renegotiated it. We've made it good. And we've opened up new negotiations with Japan, who would not negotiate with the previous administration. You know why? Because they said, "No, we're happy.
Why should we negotiate? We're not going to negotiate." Well, we said, "We want to negotiate." And with the European Union, "We want to negotiate." And they said... [Audience member calls out 'We Love You'] I love you, too. You're not my type, but I love you. That was a strong guy, by the way, in case... [Laughter] Because if that was a woman, I'm in big trouble.
And you know what? I go, I hope you're a guy. Are you? So -- so the European Union and Japan, I said, "Listen, we lost $151 billion, with a B, with you." We lost $151 billion. Jean-Claude -- he's the head of the European Union -- I said, "Jean-Claude" -- he's tough and smart, smart, really tough. I don't think he likes our country too much, but I've told him that many times.
Well, they were formed -- right? -- they were formed in order to take advantage of us. "So, Jean-Claude, for years, the Obama administration wanted to negotiate and you said, 'No, we're not going to negotiate.' I'm telling you, I want to negotiate." We lost $151 billion with the European Union. Many of us come from the European Union.
I do. I do. Many of the people in the room, sounds so nice, European Union. And they're just killing us. So I said, "We have to negotiate." "Oh, yes, yes." Two weeks go by, we don't get a call. I call him up again, I say, "Jean-Claude! We got to negotiate." "Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes." Beautiful accent.
I wish I had his accent. [Laughter] I would have been president 15 years ago if I had his accent. And I said, "Jean-Claude, please, we got to negotiate! I can't take this, $151 billion we lose. You have barriers against our farmers. We can't sell farm products. You have barriers against our cars, and yet you give us millions of Mercedes and BMW and all these cars, they pour into our country.
You have barriers and you charge us big tariffs for products. And you make it impossible for us to give you -- but you sell us so much. Jean-Claude, we have to negotiate." And he said, "Oh, yes, yes, yes." Two weeks go by. No negotiation. I say, "Jean-Claude, you don't have to negotiate anymore, Jean-Claude.
I am going to put a 25 percent tariff on Mercedes Benz, BMW, and every car you send in to the United States." "We're putting a 25 percent tariff or tax on every car, millions and millions of cars, that you send in to the United States." He said, "No, no, no, please! I will be there tomorrow morning." This was an evening.
I get to my office. He's there. [Laughter] I said, "Where did you come from, New York?" "No, no, no, I came from Europe." I said, "Let me know the name of that plane. That is the fastest plane." [Laughter] And now they're dying to make a deal. You saw what's been going on with these deals. China! They're draining us. They're taking our money.
They're rebuilding themselves. They're building a jet a day. They're building many, many bridges the size and bigger than, like, the George Washington Bridge. What are we doing? We're helping them. We've rebuilt China. They've taken so much money. I like President Xi, the head of China, but I said, "We can't do this anymore." So now we put $50 billion of tariffs on. And they said... They said, "No, no, no, no, you cannot do that.
If you go $50 billion, we'll go $50 billion." I said, "Wait a minute, we're already $500 billion behind. So if I go $50 billion, you go $50 billion, that means we're at the same place we started from. That's not what this is all about. We have to bring some balance. We can't do this." So they said, "No." So it's $50 billion at 10 percent.
I increased it to 25 percent, and I put $200 billion on top of the $50 billion. So now we have $250 billion at 25 percent. By the way, billions and billions of dollars. The fake news people back there, all those people with all those red lights... they don't want to talk about it. But all of that money, billions of dollars will be flowing in to our treasury.
Many of the products that we're buying over there will be made in the United States because they don't want to pay the tax and there's no tariffs. And I said, "If you attack our farmers, who I love" -- they're special. See, he's got the green hat on? "Make Our Farmers Great Again." Right? "Make Our Farmers Great Again." But they said, "You know what?
The farmers love Trump. We'll attack the farmers by not buying" -- well, guess what? They're starting to buy again, aren't they? But I said, "If you do that, we're going to put an additional $267 billion onto your numbers. So we're going to have $500 billion and probably it'll end up $562 billion when you add it all up, including the little stars all over the place." And you know what?
They want to talk. They want to make a deal. Then China's been hurt very badly over the last number of months. Their markets are down 30 percent. And our markets are up 55 percent since I became president. And I hope we can make a deal with China, but honestly, who knows? But we're very happy where we are.
Very, very happy. And I want to thank the farmers, because, you know, I watch the farmers. And they say -- and don't forget, the farmers have been going down like this for 20 years; long before I got here. We're going to bring those green caps. You're going to be so proud of me, OK? You're going to be so proud.
They want to talk. And at some point, they're talking. But I told them just recently, "You're not ready to talk yet. You're not ready." In all fairness, they've been making so much money. It's hard for them to say -- they're making $500 billion a year because we had -- ha, let's be nice -- we had presidents that it wasn't their thing.
But it is my thing. Do you know how wealthy our country would be if they didn't have these really stupid deals all over the place, so many of them? And how about our military deals, where we protect rich nations and we don't get reimbursed? How about that stuff? That's changing, too, folks. We protect Saudi Arabia.
Would you say they're rich? And I love the king, King Salman. But I said, "King, we're protecting you. You might not be there for two weeks without us. You have to pay for your military." "You have to pay." And Japan is going to also contribute. Japan -- we protect Japan. They pay us a small percentage. We protect South Korea.
They pay us -- and by the way, we're doing great on North Korea, but South Korea. They got to reimburse us. They've got to reimburse us. Republicans passed and I signed the biggest package of tax cuts and reform in the history of our country. We have cut a record number of regulations. Now, we got no Democrat support for any of this.
This is what's driving our economy, those two things. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs. Watch what's going to happen to drug prices. And to help critically ill patients get access to life-saving treatments, we passed what's called Right to Try. A person's terminally ill, they're going to die, and before me, if we had a drug that was really looking good or promising, we wouldn't give them, because we didn't want to hurt the person.
They're going to die. And it is actually much more complicated than that. They've been trying to pass this for 45 years. Well, two months ago, I signed Right to Try. We have the greatest drugs in the world, the greatest drugmakers in the world. I would watch wealthy people travel all over the world trying to find a cure.
And poor people just went home. They had no hope. Now they have the right to try. If we have a drug that looks good but it's two years or three years or four years out -- and, by the way, we brought that number from 15 years, we think it's going to be down to four and in some cases three. Way down. Scott is doing a great job.
Scott, get that number down, Scott. And now we have that -- I love that. Right to Try, such a great name. Right to Try. You have hope. We also passed veterans' choice. Forty-four years they tried to do it. Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor if they've got to wait on line for weeks and weeks and weeks.
Forty-four years! And we passed the landmark V.A. Accountability Act. That's people that work in the V.A. that treat our veterans badly, and we couldn't do a thing about it, and now we can fire them so fast... I just signed legislation -- and you think that was easy, getting that through the unions and civil service?
That was a 48-year job. And your two senators helped me a lot, I will tell you. They helped me a lot. Thank you, Cindy. Thank you, Roger. And your congressmen, by the way, helped me a lot -- in particular your congressman. I just signed legislation to completely rebuild our military, securing $700 billion, and then the following year $716 billion to purchase the finest planes and ships and tanks and missiles and submarines on the face of the Earth, all made in America, made in the USA.
And we have given our troops their largest pay raise in more than a decade. Isn't that nice? About time. At my direction, the Pentagon is now working very hard to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces. It's called the Space Force. So you have the Air Force, you have the Space Force. Separate.
The Space Force. And that's what it's all about, folks. You look at what's happening. I'm not just talking rockets to the moon and to Mars. I'm talking about defense. I'm talking about -- that's where it is. It's in space. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, right? Space Force! I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal.
And Iran is a much different country. They're trying to put out all the riots they have all over that country. You know, when I became a president, I looked there -- before I became -- I said, "How are you stopping Iran?" Nobody was able to tell me. And I did this and they have shattered, man. They have shattered.
I got rid of that deal. How about we gave them $150 billion for nothing? We gave them $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. And we've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we won't even mention how well we're doing with North Korea. But when I came in there, too, they were going to go to war with North Korea.
President Obama said it was his biggest problem. We sat before I took office. "What's your biggest problem?" "Biggest problem is North Korea. We were going to go with North Korea." We're doing very well now with North Korea. You don't feel that way anymore, right? You don't feel that way anymore. And the fake news comes out and says, "He's giving so much." I haven't given anything.
We got our hostages back, right? We've got a lot and we're getting the remains of our great fallen heroes back. There's been no rockets launched. There's been no missiles launched. There's been no nuclear tests. And we have a good relationship. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going over to North Korea next week.
And we're working on a second summit. And it just feels good. Now, who knows, folks? Who knows? I can just tell you, when we came in, before I came in, and at the beginning when the rhetoric was tough, right, that rhetoric was tough, these people were saying, "Oh, he's going to get us into a war." Well, guess what?
That worked out. That rhetoric was tough. And let's see what happens. But we're doing very well. We're doing very well. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Mississippi.
We are standing proudly. We are standing up for your national anthem. Right? [Audience Chants USA] A lot of spirit. A lot of spirit. One of them said the other day, "You know, President Trump can't be beaten in 2020." That's driving them crazy. Oh! Who the hell's going to beat us? Look, who's going to beat us? If another president came in, and they said, "We're coming to Mississippi, and we're going to make a speech," you know how many people would show up? Really, 300, 400. You'd have a medium-sized meeting room at a hotel.
Look at this place. Look at this place. Look at this place! We're lifting millions of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get out and vote Republican, vote for Cindy Hyde-Smith and vote for Roger Wicker.
Got to do it. A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation and more products made right here in the USA. It's a vote to reduce crime, respect law enforcement and restore the rule of law. It's a vote for strong borders, safe communities and thriving families, which you are. And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger, destruction, chaos, and to come together as neighbors, as citizens and as Americans.
To everyone in this room tonight, to every citizen watching all across our land, this is your time to choose. Very important time when you look at what's happening to Judge Kavanaugh. This is a very important time. It's time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustrations of the past or whether we continue forward into the unlimited promise of our future.
It's not up to the media or the pundits to decide your fate. It's up to you. The future is in your hands, as it was in 2016. That was a beautiful time. There has never been an election like this in our country's history. You have the power -- just as you did in 2016 -- with your vote to same America from socialism and to save America from decay.
It's up to you on November 6th to choose a future of patriotism, prosperity and pride. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to everyday Americans. We stand on the shoulder of the giants of American history, the greatest, the toughest, the most courageous men and women ever to walk the face of the Earth.
Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, won a revolution, and fought to victory in two world wars. Think of it. Think of it. Right? Think of it. American patriots defeated fascism, triumphed over communism, and delivered millions and millions and millions of people into freedom. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to tear down their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage, right?
Just like the pioneers and patriots who came before us, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory.
Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Mississippi. Get out and vote. Thank you.
Our country is respected again, remember that. We're respected again. Hello, Missouri. I'm thrilled to be back in the American heartland. I love you people. With thousands of proud, hardworking patriots. This is an incredible time for our nation. We have the best economy in our history today; today.
In fact, the stock market -- which, to me, is jobs -- the stock market hit an all time high again. Think of it. And that would mean that 101 days we hit an all time high in the stock market; we. And I don't say me, I say we because it's about we; amazing people. We're bringing back our factories, reopening our mines.
You know those mines? They're reopening. They're reopening. We love our miners. We love workers. And we're restoring our industrial might like nobody can believe. Nobody believes what's happening. After years of rebuilding other nations -- we're getting a little tired of that, right? We are finally rebuilding our nation and we are doing it with American grit, and skill and pride.
Right? Our military -- do we love our military? Do we love our law enforcement? Do we love ICE? They're tough people. We need tough people to protect. They're dealing with tough people. That's the only thing that -- if you look at it, that's what they respect. They respect strength. They respect strength.
Our military will soon be more powerful than ever before. And just today, I signed a new bill fully funding Veterans Choice for our great veterans. America is winning again, winning like never before, and America is being respected again because we are finally putting America first. And it's all going to start with Josh Hawley.
We love Josh. We love Josh. He's a star. And he just said it -- I didn't say it -- he just said it. He said this place broke every record they've ever had -- look at this place. Now the fake news will never say that. They'll never report that. [Crowd Boos] They'll never report that. They will never report it. But that's OK, because we all know it. And by the way, obviously look at what happened in 2016. Obviously.
Remember all the phony polls, the states that we were supposed to lose? And then 8 o'clock, the state closes. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas. Donald Trump has won... Remember? Remember? Remember for months, Texas was too close to -- you know, to call, remember? By the way, I have to tell you, Missouri was never too close to call, so that's good.
That's good. But remember Georgia was too close to call. Remember Utah was too close to call. OK, so now it's 8 o'clock, they closed in Texas. The polls have just closed in Texas, Donald Trump has won the state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Donald Trump has won the state of Georgia. I said, wait a minute, I thought it was so close?
It should go all night, no? We won, like, in two seconds. [Laughter] You know why? Because they're phony polls. They have phony polls. [Crowd Boos] They're called suppression polls. What they do is, you know, you're with your wife and you say, "Alice, I love Trump, but he can't win because the polls have him -- he just can't win." Suppression. "So let's go to a movie and then sadly we'll go home and watch what turned out to be the most exciting night in the history of politics, right?" That was some night.
And all those guys, they may not like us, but you know what? About six months before the election, not this one coming up -- please go out and vote. Please go out. But in 2020, about six months before the election, every single one of those haters is going to endorse is because without us, they have nobody watching television.
They have nobody. [Crowd Boos] They have nobody reading their phony papers. Nobody. So they're going to -- we expect endorsements from everybody. We'll get the New York Times, we expect to get the Washington Post, we'll get ABC, CBS, we'll get NBC -- that's a hard one to get. [Crowd Boos, chants CNN Sucks] You're right -- you're right.
Tonight we're proudly joined by terrific Republican leaders from the great state of Missouri, including Lieutenant Governor Mike Kehoe. Mike, thank you very much wherever you are. A real friend of mine, and a great friend of my wife, Mr. and Mrs. -- a great friend of Melania, whose sends her regards by the way.
She's home now. She said I like those people -- I like those people too, but he really is -- he's a great man, he's a great senator, he's respected by everybody -- everybody, Senator Roy Blunt. Thank you. Great guy. And another great guy -- he's big, he's strong, you heard him the other night when he did that whole deal going, and I said, What was that all about?
Billy Long, what was that all about? He is, he's a great guy. And another great guy that has helped us right from the beginning, Congressman Jason Smith. Thank you, Jason. Terrific people. Finally, please welcome -- they said he's only going to be a minute -- we're going to have such fun.
He's going to give us a lot of fun also -- please welcome the person we are all here tonight to support, a special man, a special talent, a man who loves this state, and he loves this country -- the next United States Senator from Missouri, Josh Hawley. Come on, Josh.
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Let me just ask you a question: How about the leadership of President Donald J. Trump? You know, I've gotta share something with the president because actually, I have to confess, I let him down a little bit. President Trump said, "I need you to get me the biggest stadium and we'll fill it full", and Mr. President, I have to say, do you know we had to turn away about 20,000 people or something who could not get into the stadium to be here tonight to see this man.
It's unbelievable -- it's unbelievable. Have you noticed -- have you noticed something about our president? When he makes a promise, he keeps it. When he makes a commitment, he delivers. And I tell you what -- I tell you what, he's delivering big for the state of Missouri and the United States of America, isn't he? I mean big.
He said -- he said he was going to stand up for American workers, and he is -- bringing back jobs, bringing back jobs from overseas, paychecks on the rise. He cut your taxes. How about that? He said -- the president said -- the president said -- the president said he was going to put pro-Constitution judges on the bench, and he has.
He has. Judges -- that's right. That's right. Wow. It's pretty good. Judges who love -- judges who love the Constitution, judges who love our country, judges like Brett Kavanaugh. And he said -- and he said -- and the president said he was going to secure our border, and he is. [Crowd chants Build that Wall] That's right -- build it. Build it. But you know, I have to say -- I have to say.
There's somebody in the state of Missouri who hasn't heard what you've been telling her. [Crowd Boos] There's somebody -- yes, it's true. There's somebody -- there's somebody who hasn't been willing to work with the president of the United States. That somebody is Claire McCaskill. [Crowd Boos] She hasn't listen to you.
Do you know Senator McCaskill said that the border wall is embarrassing? That's her word, embarrassing -- embarrassing. She said she has mocked the president. She's mocked the president for wanting to build it. And now she is sponsoring the most radical open-borders bill ever introduced in the United States Congress. [Crowd Boos] It's a -- it's a terrible -- it's terrible.
She wants to raise your taxes. She says she's going to vote no on Judge Kavanaugh. [Crowd Boos] I don't know who she's with, but she's not with the state of Missouri. So here's what I have to say -- here's what I have to say -- here's what I have to say. In 2016, this man and you made history. You made history in 2016. And now everything -- everything you've fought for, everything that he's fighting for, everything that you voted for is on the line.
So how about this. This November, in this state, right here in Missouri, let's make history again. Let's make America great again. Thank you so much. God bless you.
We need Josh in the Senate to fight for Missouri and really to fight for our whole country. We love our country. And we'll never ever get a vote from Claire McCaskill, and she's been saying very nice things.
She's been saying very nice things. But you know what? She'll never ever vote for us. She just, as an example, Brett Kavanaugh -- a fantastic man, fantastic -- she just announced she won't vote for him. Can you believe it? And he was born -- you talk about central casting -- he was born -- they were saying it 10 years ago about him -- he was born for the U.S. Supreme Court.
He was born for it. And it's going to happen. But she just announced she's not voting -- and, she'll vote against everything we want to do, including tax cuts. Figure that one out. So Claire McCaskill will never ever vote our way because she loves the swamp. She's part of the swamp and we have a true swamp in Washington.
Just look at what is now being exposed in our Department of Justice and the FBI. Look at what's going on. Look at what's going on. And I want to tell you, we have great people in the Department of Justice. We have great people. These are people, I really believe -- you take a poll, I've got to be at 95 percent -- but you've had some real bad ones.
You've seen what's happened at the FBI. They're all gone. They're all gone. They're all gone. But there's a lingering stench and we're going to get rid of that too. Claire McCaskill -- when I read about this sitting a beautiful, beautiful house called the White House. Did anybody ever hear of the White House?
She revealed her true colors when she pretended to tour the state in an R.V., while she was actually flying around the state in her luxurious private airplane. And honestly, this is before I ever thought about running -- by the way, we decided to run, how did we do? How did we do? A senator, a good guy, said to me the other day -- it was very interesting because we were talking about, frankly, Judge Kavanaugh -- and I said we have to fight for him, not worry about the other side.
And by the way, women are for that more than anybody would understand. And a really good guy, I mean, we usually agree. He said, sir, I've been in politics for 25 years. I've been a senator for many years. I really know what I'm doing. I said, sir, I've been in politics for two and a half years and I'm the President of the United States, so. True.
True. And he's still my friend; it's fine. McCaskill doesn't represent the people of Missouri; that I can tell you. She represents the radical Democrats in Washington that are trying to take over. And what they're going to do with you, you know, if you look from the day of election, I just see the announcement today.
Stock market's up 55 percent. Your 401(k)s -- your 401(k)s are up 50, 60, 70 percent in some cases. They get in and that wealth is going to disappear very quickly. It'll evaporate. It will. Claire McCaskill voted no on tax cuts, and that's tax cuts for the middle-class families. And she voted for the disaster that we're holding together, we had it defeated.
Unfortunately, we lost a certain vote. But we lost all of the Democrat votes, when you think. We lost every Democrat. We would have saved a trillion dollars and we would have given you great health care, but we still will. We need some more Republicans. We need Josh, but we need more Republicans. McCaskill voted no on Kate's Law. How about Kate's Law? You see what's coming in? She voted no on Kate's Law. How do you vote no on Kate's Law? You know why she voted no? Because Schumer and Pelosi told her to vote no. And she voted no on enhanced vetting for refugees.
A refugee comes in you don't know where they're coming from. I want to do -- we call it, a term I came up with, I'm very -- enhanced vetting. She voted no. But we're coming out with things over the next four weeks; you'll like it better than enhanced vetting. She wants to let everybody pour into our country.
She wants to then give them health care. Next will be, let's also give them free education. Let's also -- let's also hurt the State of Missouri and every other state. You see what's going on in California. He wants to have open borders and everybody worldwide can pour into California, just pour in. And he's going to give you health care and education.
You know what? That will be -- I think California will end up being larger than the United States. The whole world is going to come. It's really bad stuff. And they're going to kill your Medicare. And they're going to kill you Medicaid. They're going to kill everything that you cherish and that you want. McCaskill voted no on our new Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, how good is he? And as Josh said, she's not going back on a no vote on somebody who's truly spectacular, Brett.
Yet, McCaskill voted for the liberal Obama judges who want to destroy your Second Amendment. They want to destroy your health care. They want to destroy your wealth. That's what they're going to do. They want to take it away. They want to take it away. You can work hard, won't mean anything. And you know what they want to do? They all as a group, they want to raise the hell out of your taxes; figure that one.
Another thing, military, they don't want to take care of the military. We're always -- I can only tell you, I have to fight so hard to take care of our military $700 billion and we had to give up things that I hated to give up. But we had to build our military because it was depleted. It was in trouble. They fought so hard, not to take care of our vets and not to take care of our military.
It's no good, doesn't work that way. Doesn't work that way. A vote for Claire McCaskill is a vote for Nancy Pelosi... [Crowd Boos] Chuck Schumer, and your new de facto leader of the Democrat Party, the legendary Maxine Waters. [Crowd Boos] The new platform of the Democrat Party is radical socialism and open boarders.
A vote for any Democrat this November -- you've got to get out and vote, I know you're complacent. We had this great victory. I know that the odds are sort of against it, but I don't know why. We have the greatest economy in history. We have the greatest -- and so -- but they say -- hey, out of 100 years, like three times, whoever's in the White House loses the midterm.
You lose the midterm, we're going to go through nothing but fights, we're going to be fighting to keep what you have, they're going to want to take it away. You've got to get out. Can't be complacent. It's fragile. You've got to get out. You know, a poll came out, they said everybody's going out in 2020, because they want to vote for you, they want to vote for the president.
But they're not maybe coming out in 2018. Get out in 2018, because you're voting for me in 2018. You're voting for me. You're voting for me. A vote for any Democrat this November is a vote for massive regulation, massive taxes, and I hate to say it, massive crime, because crime comes with it. [Crowd Boos] The Democrat Party is held hostage by far-left activists, by angry mobs, Antifa, by deep state radicals... [Crowd Boos] ...and their establishment cronies.
You ever see what happens when they take the masks of Antifa? You have guys -- you have guys that look like they live with mom and dad in the basement. They live in the basement of mom and dad's home. You know what that is? That's the size of their biceps, but they wear -- they wear the tough black outfits.
No, I would never suggest this, but I will tell you, I -- they're so lucky that we're peaceful. Law enforcement, military, construction workers, Bikers for Trump -- how about Bikers for Trump? They travel all over the country. They got Trump all over the place, and they're great. They've been great. But these are tough people.
These are great people. But they're peaceful people, and Antifa and all -- they'd better hope they stay that way. I hope they stay that way. I hope that stay that way. And they will, the Democrats, say and do anything to try and undermine the result of the greatest election in our country's history. That's what it is. They want to try and reclaim their corrupt power.
Remember, remember, they were expected to win. And there was no way that Donald Trump can get to 270. You know, the Electoral College was set up so we can't win, except we had one problem: we won a lot of states that haven't been won for many years by Republicans. A lot of states. A lot of states. I remember watching the fake news, and one man -- I like him, not as a person, but I like watching him, especially when he's upset.
And he said, you know, I think -- I think Trump is going to win Wisconsin -- that hasn't been won in many -- I think Trump is going to win Michigan! Oh no, no, no, no, no. Remember with the hand, that it starts to shake. He's very confident at the beginning, Senator, OK, this could be a quick game day. And then they say wait a minute, wait a minute, oh my god, woah, woah.
Trump just won the state of Florida. Woah, woah, woah. No. No. What happened? They don't say she spent about five times more money. You know, in the old days, if you spent less money and win, that's a good thing. Nobody ever says that. Do they ever say I spent like 25 percent of the money that she spent? So here's the thing -- then they said, wait a minute.
Oh no. Remember the firewall? The firewall, the guarantee, she spent a fortune, was going to be the great state of North Carolina, and we love them and they're going through a lot tonight. We love them. We say prayers for them. And South Carolina. North Carolina, South Carolina. South Carolina's going to be hit really hard tomorrow at about 3 o'clock.
That water is pouring down, it's on its way, it's going to be horrible, but they're -- they're ready. I was just there. So while we talk about them, I have to say God is with you, we are with you. And -- and we have the best first responders, military, law enforcement, and FEMA, the best in the world, and they're ready.
They're all equipped, so we'll be there. We're all ready. They'll be -- they'll be OK. But you remember all of that. So then we won the firewall, North Carolina. We won South Carolina easily, but that was expected. But then we won the firewall. Donald Trump has won the state of North Carolina. Now the hand is quivering as it goes to -- you know the board?
And that board is becoming redder and redder and redder and they say, woah. And then a state I love, Pennsylvania, hasn't been won in a long time. Hasn't been won in a long time. Republicans always think they're going to win Pennsylvania, they just never do. And we were way up in Pennsylvania with only 2 percent of the vote left and then 1 percent of the vote left and if I left every single vote -- I won it by a lot.
They refused to call it. I said wait a minute. If I lose every vote, I win it. Why aren't they -- it took them, like, until 2 o'clock in the morning, they refused, but that's when Wisconsin and Michigan kicked in surprisingly except not surprisingly to us because we'd go and we'd have crowds like this and I kept saying, well let's see, she had 400 people, I had 32,000, explain.
What are we going to lose this state? Why do we lose this state? And we didn't. And we didn't. That was a great evening. One of the greatest nights in the history of our country, but one, far less importantly, one of the greatest nights in the history of television. They did very well. They're doing very well on our backs.
The so-called "resistance" doesn't accept the will of the American people. They don't believe you have the right to run your own country, control your own lives or defend the nation's borders, traditions, and heritage. But the American people will never ever be silenced. You will never be silenced. We'll never be intimidated.
And this November, you will make your voice heard, just like you did two Novembers ago, in the most exciting evening for a longtime, maybe ever. Also at stake in this election is Medicare. Republicans want to protect Medicare. Democrats want to raid Medicare to pay their socialism. We'll end up being another Venezuela.
That's not going to happen to us. [Crowd Boos] And Josh -- Josh will help -- Josh will help a lot. That vote means so much. Democrats want to destroy Medicare with so-called "Medicare for all" -- robbing our seniors of the benefits they paid into for their entire lives. Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it. For many, many years, they've been paying for it. Democrats even want to give welfare and free health care to illegal aliens. [Crowd Boos] All paid for by you, the great American taxpayer.
Republicans want to protect the safety for truly needy Americans, not for illegal aliens. We don't want that -- can't afford it. I'd be nice. You can't afford it. When it comes to health care, republicans will protect patients with preexisting conditions. They're going to protect preexisting conditions. I will always protect preexisting conditions, and Josh Hawley will always preexisting conditions.
Very important. The policies of the Democrat Party -- and you know, everybody always says the Democratic Party. It's not the name. It sounds better. I like saying it better. It's sweeter, right? The Democratic Party is better than the Democrat Party, but it's really the Democrat Party. And why should I make it sound sweet, right?
No, it's -- it is. It's the -- it's not called the Democratic Party. That's actually a nice name. They probably should change their name. I don't want to give them any ideas. But to me, it's the Democrat Party, and they aren't just extreme. They are, frankly, dangerous, and they are crazy. They're crazy. Democrats want to abolish us. In other words, they want to abolish immigration enforcement entirely, let violent sadistic gangs, like MS-13 -- the worst gang in the world -- run wild in our communities.
I've seen our guys from ICE. I've seen it, I've watched it. MS-13, they're tough, but they're not tough like our guys. They're not tough our ICE people. Our guys and girls, they go in there -- man, I'll tell you, it's unbelievable. And that's what we need. You know, you can't have, like, Oh, isn't he a wonderful person.
He's nice. He's -- we need tough people. These are tough people. These are sadistic, mean, sick criminals. ICE is incredible, and we're going to protect them, and we're going to cherish them, and we're going to thank them very much for keeping our communities safe. Democrats want to open borders, which equals massive crime.
Republicans want strong border, and we want no crime. We don't want crime. Democrat support sanctuary cities, cities of crime. They'll flood our streets with criminal aliens and violent gangs. Republicans believe that our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. Democrats want to dismantle law enforcement and attack the hero's who keep us safe.
Republicans stand proudly with the brave men and women of ICE, border patrol, and law enforcement. Everyday, our heroic ICE officers are tracking down gang members, predators, thieves and killers. And we are either throwing them the hell in jail or throwing them the hell out of our country. [Crowd chants] So never made a lot of sense to me, somebody who wants to open borders -- crime, and somebody wants higher taxes.
Think of it. So you got open borders, you have crime. Here's their platform, crime and high taxes. I don't like that. I don't think I could win. That's not a good platform. Crime -- think of it, crime and high taxes. Now there's only things we won't even get in, but how do you get past those first two things?
Crime -- that's the democrats, crime and high taxes. And we're doing things about it, folks. And by the way, we had a record this month, on the border. We took in and arrested more illegal's coming across -- many of these were not good people -- than we've ever done before -- ever done before. And if they'd let us build that wall faster, if Congress could give us those funds -- the thing I do best is build -- I could build the whole thing in a year.
We're building 1 billion 6, another 1 billion 6, now it's another billion, but a lot of people have promised us, right after the election, they're going to approve the rest of the wall. Lets see if they keep their promise -- lets see. Let's see. But, it's getting built -- it's getting built anyways. It's not easy -- yep we're building it, not easy.
People think it's easy. You know Schumer and Pelosi... [Crowd Boos] They have bigger things -- they have bigger things, but the thing they want to obstruct and resist the most, even though they were in favor of a wall in 2006 -- they were in favor of it. Ask Israel whether or not a wall works. It works. It works.
And by the way, speaking of Israel, the embassy is now open and happily living in Jerusalem. It would've been 25 years before it was built. You know the story, right? Our great ambassador, David Friedman, one of the most successful lawyers in New York -- he loves Israel, he wanted to be the ambassador to Israel.
I put him there. And people were pressing for Israel, and they were pressing for Jerusalem to be the capital, move the embassy. And what happened is every president, for many, many presidents, said we're going to do what they campaigned, and then they lied. They didn't have the guts to do it. And I know why.
Because when it was obvious for people that I wanted to do it, I was called by virtually every leader in the world. People were calling me and they say, please don't do it. Please don't do it. Please don't do it, and I got a little bit tired of trying to be nice, so the last week I just didn't take their calls and I said, and I said, Ill call them back in a week.
Kings, queens, presidents, prime ministers, dictators, they're all calling; they all worry. They didn't want to me -- that's why the other presidents didn't do it. I mean, I've never had such pressure put on -- everybody was going, don't do it, so I just said I'll call them back after I do it, that's much easier.
Then I say, hi, you know what -- you ever do this? Get me so and so, Prime Minister so and so, it was just approved. So a day later, "Hi, how're you doing? What's up?" [Laughter] And they go, oh, well we called for a certain reason, but that's OK. But the great story is I had a bill essentially, on my desk for the embassy cost in Israel.
I said, "How much is that? I'm sorry, what's this?" "Sir, that's the embassy in Israel." I said, "What is it?" "Sir, it's going to cost approximately $1.1 billion." I said, whoa, we know how to build -- two friends of mine are builders right here. They hear -- they haven't spent that much in their whole life, and they built a hell of a lot of stuff.
I mean, you know, like it's a one story building right -- "$1.1 billion, sir." And I actually had it half signed. I had Donald on it -- Donald -- I said, "What?" So I call David Friedman, I said, "David, let me ask you question. They want to spend $1.1 million on the embassy". It's crazy -- I mean it's crazy.
He said, "Could I call you back? Because I have an idea." I said, "Call me back". Now he knows Israel really well. So we own a piece of land in Jerusalem. He said it's the best location. We have a lot of great locations because we're there early, you know, like post offices are great locations because you're there early; we're the first ones.
Anytime you get a post -- real estate 101 -- anytime you get a post office, it's a good location. They're there there -- you know, it's early. So, David, said you know "There's a piece of land that we have that's fantastic. It's got a building on it; I'd like to look at it." And I said, look at it. He calls me back, he says, "It's fantastic, it's very big -- we can have setbacks, we can do everything we're supposed to do, and there's a building on it. And, sir, you don't have to spend $1.1 billion." I said, "What do you think it'll cost to renovate the building?" He said about $190,000. I said... I said, "What?" He said, yes.
It's the best site you can have. We have the best site, very big. You know, you want it set back for the obvious reasons. I said, "$190,000?" I said, "David, that almost -- does this make sense? I hate to say this -- it sounds too cheap." [Laughter] He said, "No, we're going to use the finest Jerusalem stone." It's a beautiful stone.
People use it, spend a lot of money. There, they have a lot of Jerusalem stone, you're in Jerusalem. But... [Laughter] ... I said, David, "Will you do me a favor? Let's do it, but make it $400,000, OK? Make it beautiful, David. Make it beautiful." He said OK. So here's the story, $1.1 billion and it will never get built.
It wouldn't be built for 25 years. As opposed to $400,000 and we just opened the most beautiful embassy -- it's been open for seven months. Seven months. So we saved essentially, over $1 billion -- actually, we really saved $1.1 billion, you want to know the truth. But we saved $1.1 billion. We opened it up in four months.
It took four months. We had the big ceremony. And it was -- it's just incredible and the people love it. And you know who loves it? Evangelical Christians love it. They love it. They love it. They love it. And we can do that in 100 different ways. I could tell you story after story about costs where we're defending wealthy countries and not being reimbursed.
We're defending wealthy, wealthy countries and we're not being reimbursed, OK? So we're doing it step-by-step. Go to the wealthiest countries in the world, you know, we've been defending you for like 30, 40 years. It's time you sort of help out a little bit here, folks. And they're going to do it. They're going to do it. A lot of them.
They're going to do it. So this election is about security and it's about prosperity, the trade deals. These trade deals are incredible. We didn't even negotiate them. They were ripping us off. We were being ripped off by allies and enemy -- we were being ripped off by anybody. So here is just of our great achievements: economic growth for last quarter hit 4.2 percent, unthinkable.
Unthinkable. Jobless claims just fell to a nearly 50-year low; jobless claims. Isn't that nice? Think of it, jobless claims. So number one, the people are happy. Number two, the country's saving a fortune, think of it. Jobless claims fell to a 50-year low. We've created over 4 million new jobs since our election.
We've lifted almost 4 million Americans off food stamps, saving a fortune and they're happy. We've added nearly 400,000 new manufacturing jobs, remember? You'll never have another manufacturing job, right? He's the guy. You'll never have another manufacturing job, remember the magic wand? What are you going to get, a magic wand?
Yes, I got a magic wand. And very soon, it's going to be 600,000. And you saw Apple, Tim Cook, great guy. They're bringing in $350 billion and they're going to be building facilities all over, including an incredible campus. And $230 billion is coming from offshore because of our new tax bill. It's coming from offshore.
And they're spending it in our country; our country. Household incomes among Hispanic Americans have just set a new record, think of that. Income for Hispanic Americans has set a new record. Hispanic American unemployment recently reached the lowest rate in recorded American history. African American unemployment recently achieved the lowest rate ever recorded in our country's history.
Remember? I used to say what do you have to lose, right? What do you have to lose? People would say oh, no, you shouldn't say that. That's not nice. I said of course I have to say that. For years, African Americans voted for Democrats, for 100 years. And for 100 years they were lied to. They were cheated.
And I said what do you have to lose, and now we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country for African Americans. And we have just started. We've just started. We haven't even been here for two years. Asian American unemployment has also achieved all time historic lows. The poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans have reached their lowest levels in history.
Poverty rates the lowest in history. Youth unemployment has just reached its lowest rate in nearly a half a century, 50 years. Unemployment for Americans is very important. Without a high school diploma, recently reached the lowest rate ever recorded. That's somebody that never got through high school but they're great people.
They're great people. But for the women, I failed. I failed. Women unemployment rate recently reached its lowest rate in 65 years. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sixty-five years. I failed for the women but within a short period of time -- it's the best numbers for women in 65 years. Within a short period of time, it will be in history just like all the others.
I thought it was going to happen actually this week. I would have like to have said that. We are fixing one-sided trade deals that have stolen American jobs and drained American wealth, just taken away our wealth. It's like candy from a baby, they took our money, they took our jobs, they took everything. They took our dignity.
They took our dignity. We've reached a deal to replace NAFTA with a beautiful brand new U.S.-Mexico trade deal. And we're working on a separate deal with Canada as we speak, we'll see what happens. Canada is charging a lot of money. Canada -- you know, they don't say this -- Canada charges 300 percent tax... [Crowd Boos] ... tax for dairy products going across -- 300 percent.
I say, you can't do that. So, look, we love the Canadians, but they've done very well with us over the last 35 years. So we're working on a deal with Canada. Probably it'll happen. If it doesn't happen, we'll be very well off. We're also cracking down on the unfair trade practices from China. China last year took out $500 billion from our country -- 500 billion, Five hundred -- not million -- 500 billion.
We have rebuilt China. We have given them such wealth. And were changing it. So we charged 25 percent on $50 billion worth of merchandise [Inaudible] tariffs coming in. And then they said, well, we're going to do the same thing. I said, that's OK, we have far more bullets. We're going to go $200 billion at 25 percent, Chinese-made goods, and we will come back more if they retaliate.
We have a lot more to come back with it. And they want to make a deal, and let's see if we can make a deal The problem is, whether it's China or Canada, or really anybody, they've lived so well off us for so long, it takes a little while, folks; it takes a little bit of while -- you know, when they're taking our $400 billion or $500 billion a year, and then you say, one guy comes in -- other presidents should have done this.
They should have -- there's no way I should have been put in this position. There's no way I should have been put in the position where North Korea and the United States were ready to go to war. I took that over and we're doing very well there too, doing very well there too. Doing very well. Have a very good relationship.
You know they've been working on that relationship for like 72 years. I got back, what, three months ago, and the fake news, said -- look, we got back our hostages. We got back our beautiful heroes. We got back our remains, right. You see they're coming back. And more is coming back, and more. They're not testing rockets and missiles.
They're not testing nuclear. It's all -- and we have a nice relationship -- so when did I get back? Like, what, three months ago. So here's their new one -- he's not moving fast enough. For 72 years they haven't done -- I've been back here for, like, three months. The relationship is very good. Chairman Kim, Kim Jong-un, sent me a beautiful letter two days ago.
They're dying to see what was in the letter. One day I'll show them. [Laughter] But it was a great letter. It was a great letter, and we have very good relations. And let's see what happens. Let's see. Let's see. I'm in no rush. I'm in no rush. The sanctions remain. We haven't done anything. The sanctions are there.
Unlike that crummy Iran deal that I eradicated; I took it away. And look at what happened to Iran since we did that. Look at what happened. Riots in every city. You know when I took over and before I took over, everybody said, Iran will take over the entire Middle East. Now Iran wants to survive, OK. They're no longer looking at the Mediterranean, OK. And hopefully we'll be able to do something with Iran, but you know what, if it happens, good; if it doesn't happen that's OK. You know, that's OK. So let's see.
But they're not doing so well, folks. They're pulling in people from all over, but you know what? I hope we get along with them great, but it's not easy for them, and frankly it's not easy for others until we get treated with the respect that we deserve. To give our workers and businesses a level playing field, Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.
This year alone, families in Missouri will see a tax cut of more than $4 billion. Thank you. Four billion. That's in Missouri. We're making healthcare more affordable and accessible. We're keeping down the costs of the -- you know, I call it the remnants -- the remnants, because getting rid of the individual mandate is -- was a great thing.
I mean, how many people are helped by that? That was the most unpopular -- most unpopular thing in Obamacare, where you had the privilege of paying a fortune for not having to pay a fortune to have healthcare. And you know what? That doesn't work. So you're paying a lot of money for not having to pay for bad healthcare.
That doesn't really work. We got rid of it. You know how many businesses -- how many businesses were helped by that? No more individual mandate. The worst thing in Obamacare. And we're giving critically ill patients access to life-saving medicine and new techniques and new anything in Right to Try. They've been trying to pass that for 38 years, they say.
We got it passed. So now if somebody's sick, really sick -- you know, if they had money, they'd travel all over the world, they wanted hope, they were trying to find something. If they didn't have money, they -- they just didn't have any chance. And now we have some of the greatest medicines in the world.
They're under review. And if somebody's terminally ill, I want to give them the right to try. I want to give them the right to try. And now we give them the right to try. And many lives will be saved because we have incredible -- incredible things, but some of them won't be passed and approved for another 3 or 4 years, and we brought that number -- it was taking 15 years to have something approved; we're bringing it down to 2 or 3 or 4. FDA. Scott.
Good job, Scott. We passed the largest veterans reform in half a century, including the landmark V.A. Accountability Act. You know all about that. If a bad government worker abuses one of our great veterans, we turn to them and we say: you're fired. [Crowd calls out You're Fired] That was a big deal. They've been trying to do that for 45 years.
Hard to do. You know why? I mean, I hate to say, a lot of respect for unions, a lot of respect for civil servants, but that's a tough thing to get by the unions and the civil servants, right? We're rebuilding our military. It will soon be more powerful than it has ever been before and everything is being made in the U.S.A., jobs, right?
Jobs, jobs, jobs. After years of depleting our military and letting our bases and equipment fall into total disrepair, we are now purchasing the finest planes and ships and tanks and missiles and artillery and submarines anywhere on earth; nobody makes it like us, nobody's even close. And we secured a record $700 billion for our military this year and $716 billion next year.
That will do things... No country is even close. And again, very unimportantly by comparison, jobs to me are the most important, but there's nothing more important than our military. There's nothing more important than protection, especially in the world in which we live. But -- but jobs are very important, and I love to say it's built right here in our country.
Because we understand that there is no substitute in this world for American power and American strength. And at my direction, the Pentagon is working hard to create a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces called Space Force. That would have been a dream 5 years ago. You have Air Force and you now have Space Force soon, soon.
So that's basically it, folks. I could go on all night. All of the things. All of the things. I could go on all night. I took out -- last night in Las Vegas we had a packed house there too. I took out all of the things -- all -- every line is another thing. Some of these are big things, but I'm not boring you with it, I'm just telling you, we did a lot.
One of these very fine gentlemen in the back said, you know, it's very strange, but he actually did more than he promised. I actually did much more than I promised. For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America. [Crowd Boos] Now you have a president who will never apologize for America but only will stand up for America.
We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for Missouri. And we are standing up for our National Anthem. To continue this momentum, to protect your family, your jobs, and your country, you need to get your friends, get your family, get your coworkers, and get out and vote Republican and vote for Josh Hawley -- Josh Hawley.
Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together, we are taking back our country and returning power to where it belongs, the American people. It was right here in Missouri. They're great explorers, maybe the greatest explorers -- I know you've never heard of them -- Louis and Clark -- began their epic journey across the American West.
They brave the wilderness, face the unknown, and never turn back until they achieved their incredible American destiny. That's what it was, a great destiny - brave, brilliant, incredible people. Today, we stand on the shoulders of the giants of American history, the greatest, toughest, most courageous men and women ever to walk the face of the earth, ever.
Our ancestors crossed the ocean, settled a continent, won a revolution and fought, to victory, in two world wars. American patriots, like you, defeated fascism, triumphed over communism, and delivered millions into freedom. That's us -- freedom. These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tear down their legacy, erase their history and sacrifice our proud American heritage.
Our country and our movement -- it's a movement. This was maybe the greatest movement in the history of our country. This was a movement. This wasn't about me. This is a movement. Outside, you have thousands and thousands of people. And I'm telling you. If somebody else had won or take anybody else in the history of our country and tell them we're coming to Missouri to make a speech -- some president -- if 300 people show up -- seriously, use a conference room someplace, a little conference room, a little -- you have to see what's outside.
You think you're a lot of people? How about doubling or tripling it outside? And Josh said that -- Josh said that. And we put big screens outside because this is happening all over the country. We put big beautiful screens -- so to all of the people outside, you're not as good in real estate as the people inside, but we'll get you next time.
We love you anyway. We have only just begun. Like the pioneers and patriots of the past, we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. We are going to win for our families, we are going to win for our freedom, and we are going to win for our great American flag. We will not bend, we will not break, we will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, and we will always fight onto victory.
We will always be victorious. Because we are American, and our hearts truly bleed red, white and blue. Now and forever, we are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Missouri. Thank you. Go vote for Josh.
Hello, Florida. Hello. Incredible people. I am thrilled to be in this great state where we, by the way, had a great victory. With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country and respect our great American flag.
We're honored to be joined tonight by some tremendous people. Congressman Gus Bilirakis. Gus! Where is Gus? Where is Gus? Where is Gus? Ted Yoho and Matt Gaetz. Thank you. Great, fellows. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, fellows. I also want to recognize State Representative Jose Oliva and the former co-chairman of my Florida campaign, Representative Joe Gruters. Joe? Thank you, Joe. Thank you. [Audience Member calls out "We Love You"]
And finally  I love you, too. I'd like to introduce a true leader, a proud veteran, my great friend, a tough, brilliant cookie. [Laughter] True. He's tough, he's smart, and he loves Florida, and he loves our country, and he's going to be your next governor, Ron DeSantis. [Inaudible]
Welcome to Florida, Mr. President. [Applause] For someone who grew up just across the bay in Pinellas County, starting out working six bucks an hour, it's a true honor to be standing here, endorsed by the President of the United States. I appreciate your support, Mr. President, but I appreciate more the leadership you're showing for our great country.
We have the strongest economy we've had in years. We are standing foursquare behind our ally, the State of Israel. We have strong Constitutionalists was being put on our courts, including the Supreme Court. We have ended the disastrous Iran deal. And under the president's leadership, we are standing against socialist dictatorships in Latin America like Cuba and Venezuela and Nicaragua.
Florida is going in the right direction, and we need to continue our success and build upon it. We can't go back to the days of Charlie Crist, where the good ol' boys run the show. [Booing] We can make our state without peer for economic opportunity if we continue with strong Conservative policies. We can fight illegal immigration. All we've got to do is enact E-Verify and stop sanctuary cities.
We can end judicial activism in Florida by appointing solid Constitutionalists to our state courts, just like the president has done to the federal courts. And we can improve our education system by stopping Common Core, by -- by giving every child, regardless of circumstance, the ability to attend a good school, and by getting the Constitution back in our classrooms in a very big way.
So, Mr. President, thank you for your support, thank you for what you're doing for the state of Florida. I ask for your vote in the August primary, August 28th, I'd be honored to have it. Thank you guys and God bless America, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you, Ron. And everybody needs to support Ron DeSantis in our August 28th primary and in the November general election, don't forget. You have somebody, one of the group is going to be running on open borders, anti-ICE, anti-law enforcement. [Booing]
Oh, that's too bad, that's too bad. That's too bad. That's too bad. One person  one person, and tomorrow the headlines will be massive protests. [Laughter] Too bad. Sorry about that, Ron. Earlier today I also spent time with your current Governor, one of our nation's truly great leaders, Rick Scott.
As you know, Rick is running to replace liberal Democrat, Schumer-controlled, Nancy Pelosi-controlled ... [Booing] ... And the new star of the Democrat Party, Maxine Waters. [Booing] Name is Bill Nelson, and you know I live a lot of time in Florida. The only time I see Bill Nelson is five months before every election. [Laughter]
And after a while you forget, who's the Senator? But around five months you see him at parties and you see him around and we have to be careful, because we have to make sure that Rick Scott wins and wins big. Bill Nelson voted for Obamacare, which has been a totally disastrous situation. [Booing] And we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular aspect and most of Obamacare will be gone very soon.
In fact, it was gone until one gentleman decided at 2:00 in the morning ... [Booing] Remember? Thank you very much, we appreciate it. And he voted against tax cuts, and he wants to go in there and raise your taxes. Tell me, is that good politics? I don't think so. Bill Nelson voted in favor of sanctuary cities ... [Booing] He opposed Kate's Law. Bill Nelson puts criminal aliens before American citizens, which is why it's time to vote Bill Nelson out of office. That's what's going to happen.
And we have two unbelievable people  Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott  fighting for Florida. They always will. And fighting to make America great again. That's what they're doing. That's what they're doing.
So  I'm sure we all say this about our children, but I have great children. And a couple of them-plus are here tonight. I have Eric Trump, who's been fantastic. He loves this political stuff. Eric's wife, Lara, who is so great. I think she singlehandedly won the state of North Carolina for Trump.
Thank you, Lara. Didn't hurt in Pennsylvania, either. Thank you very much. And we have somebody that nobody ever heard of, Ivanka. Ivanka.
Thank you. And, you know, we have a big thing happening because you know this  look at all those hats. White ones, red ones, they all have the same thing, "Make America Great."
Well, make America great again. Only to be replaced by "Keep America Great" in about, I don't know, I guess we could do it now but let's wait another year. We could do it right now, frankly. We're doing fantastically well.
I also want to thank David Bossie for being here, Corey Lewandowski for being here, two of our great supporters.
I'll tell you, they are two fighters. We like fighters, don't we? We started off, it was a small group. They said it couldn't be done. It was actually done quite easily. We won quite handily. We were never left center stage.
You know what that means, right? The debates. We never left center stage. And I said, "I always want odd numbers." Because I want to be in the center. I didn't want to be tied for the center. Does everybody understand?
But we never  we never left center stage. And I'll tell you. Corey, David, Ivanka, Lara, Eric, Don, Jr., all of them, they were fantastic. They were fantastic. And I have to say, our First Lady is home watching. Look at all those cameras right there. She's home watching. And everybody loves Melania. They love Melania. Great. Doing a fantastic thing. She's doing a fantastic job.
Just last week, it was announced that the U.S. economy grew at 4.1 percent last quarter. It was a number that everybody said was not reachable. And I would never want to say it during the campaign, even though I believed it. I believed it, because they would not have given us the break. Fake news, fake news. [Booing]
They are fake. No, I mean, do you believe  look at this: Every night, it's the same thing. Wouldn't you think they'd get tired of these speeches? Wouldn't you think?
And here's one thing I'll tell you: If they don't get ratings, those speeches don't go on, doesn't matter. Look how many they have back there. They just can't get enough. They can't get enough. They cannot get enough. And by the way, outside, if you want to go, we set up, for the first time, a tremendous movie screen, because we have thousands and thousands of people outside that couldn't get in.
So we have a big screen and big loudspeakers, and I hope you're all happy out there. This is a great place to be. If you've got to be outside, be outside in the great state of Florida, right? Right? So we're setting records like never before. Since the election, we have added 3.7 million new jobs. They would not have believed that.
We're in the longest positive job growth streak in history. Think of that. Remember, I said, "What do you have to lose?," right? What do I  OK? What do you have to lose? And people said, "I don't know." Is that a nice thing? No, it's not nice, or not un-nice. What do you have to lose?
The African-American unemployment rate has reached the lowest level in history  history.
Thank you. You guys are great. Thank you. Blacks for Trump. They say, "Blacks for Trump." You knew a long time ago, didn't you, huh? You knew a long time ago. Thank you, folks. Thank you. The Hispanic unemployment rate is at the lowest level in history, Hispanic. The Asian unemployment rate has reached the lowest level in history.
Sorry about this, women, but the employment rate has reached the lowest level in only 65 years. It'll be history soon. It'll be. It'll be history soon. Give us about two more weeks. [Audience Chants]
The veterans' unemployment rate  oh, do we love our veterans, right? Has reached the lowest level in 18 years. More than 3.5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election. American oil production is at an all-time high, we have never produced as much. And the United States is now a net natural gas exporter for the first time in more than 60 years  60. We will very shortly be the largest in the world in energy, the largest in the world, think of that.
And most importantly, America is being respected again, we're respected again. And I told the story the other day, I get to meet all these world leaders. Virtually everyone comes into the Oval Office or wherever we're meeting and they don't know me. I'm meeting them in many cases for the first time. I'm not sure they like me, like in the case of NATO. I said you got to pay your bills, folks, got to pay up, got to pay up.
But they liked it, they liked it. But everyone that reached me says hello, Mr. President, congratulations on what you've done for the economy. It's the talk of the world, talk of the world. Now that we have the best economy in the history of our country, this is the time to straighten out the worst trade deals ever made by any country on Earth, they are the worst.
For decades, United States was the piggy bank that everybody was robbing. All of these other countries, our friends, our enemies, our allies... [Booing] The foe, foe. We rebuilt China paying hundreds of billions of dollars a year with nobody there to protect your money. But you're there now, we are protecting your money.
And I want to thank our farmers, our farmers are true patriots. Because China and others have targeted  China and others, remember this, have targeted our farmers. [Booing] Not good, not nice. And you know what our farmers are saying? It's OK, we can take it. These are incredible people, we can take it.
You know why? They target our farmers because they know it's one of our great strengths. It's us, it's not me, it's us altogether. They know it's one of our great strengths.
We won every farm state, you're going to see that middle of that map  wasn't even the middle, it was about everything but a little corners of each side. But you have to see, that is all red, Republican red, beautiful, Republican red.
And remember this, remember this. Farms have been on a decline, I mean it's been for 15 years. I've only been here for, you know  it's pretty soon going to be close to two years.
But if you look at soybeans  big crop. If you go back to Election Day and then move back five years, so five years before Election Day, soybeans dropped 50 percent in price. I wasn't even here, so now we're going to open up markets, We're going to do it the way it should be. And all of this stuff, you're going to make it back and it's going to be made back faster than anybody would know.
But we haven't been treated right. We're going to make it back nice and quickly. Nice and quickly. Now, after years of rebuilding foreign countries, it's time to finally rebuild our country, right? Wouldn't you say? Right?
In the past, politicians ran for office pledging to crack down on unfair trade. They never did anything about it. Only to get elected, and they just didn't do anything. The United States was allowed to truly get ripped off. [Booing]
But we're not going to let that happen. I'm not like other politicians. You've seen what happens. I've kept my promises. One of the brilliant pundits that has a  doesn't have a clue. I mean, these people, how they have gotten us wrong. And you know what they were asking, Election Day, "Where did all these people come from? Where did they come from?"
In Tennessee, that was an early state. They came in and they were pouring in with the early vote. And the fake news was saying, "Where are these people coming from?" [Laughter]
You know where they came from? They came from the heart. They came from people that were never happy with anybody until we came along. That's where they came from. That's where they came from.
But one of the pundits said that "He's made a lot of promises. And you won't believe it, but he's actually kept far more promises than he made." Did you ever hear that one? So. Of course they'll probably be throwing him out of broadcasting tomorrow.
We've taken the toughest-ever actions in response to China's abusive trade practices. And we're doing very well with China, very well. And I have a lot of respect for China. And I have tremendous respect for President Xi of China. But this has been too many years of abuse, $500 billion a year. $500 billion. We've helped rebuild China. We can't do that anymore. [Booing]
We can't do that anymore. And our farmers understand it, and our workers understand it. And, frankly, our companies understand it. I was with one of the greatest companies in the world. The chief executive officer, very short while ago. And it really affects him. He said, "You know what, this does affect our company. But, Mr. President, keep going. You're doing the right thing." I thought it was great.
I thought it was great. A great company, one of the greatest. He said, "You're doing the right thing." And I said, "I appreciate it." Thanks to our powerful trade policies, the trade deficit is falling and falling and falling. And, boy, did it fall this quarter. The days of plundering American jobs and American wealth, those days are over, they're over. America first  America first. We're also living by two very important rules, buy American and hire American.
Last week I visited with hundreds of American steel workers, who were laid off years ago because other countries were dumping steel all over our country. They're not dumping so much anymore, you notice? And if they do, they're paying a 25 percent tariff or tax.
So you know what I say to that? Dump all you want. I hope you dump a lot. [Laughter] Now thanks to our tariffs, our steel workers are back on the job, American steel mills are back open for business, we are starting to set new records and nobody believed it could happen this quickly.
U.S. Steel just announced that they're building six new steel mills. And that number's soon going to be lifted, but I'm not allowed to say that, so I won't. [Laughter]
And I'm very proud to report that NuCor is going to build a brand new $240 million steel mill  that's a big one, right here in Florida, the head of NuCor is here. Thank you, thank you  head of NuCor.
That's a big one. Democrats want to raise your taxes, they want to destroy your jobs... [Booing] They want to crush our industries with crippling regulations, and you know the stock market is up almost 40 percent since that great November day. Your 401Ks are doing very well, 401Ks.
I tell the story, I was in New York and I shake hands. I love law enforcement  do we love law enforcement? And I was shaking hands with policemen in New York City, and the first one came up to me and said Mr. President, I want to thank you so much. I said what did I do? He said my 401K is up 44 percent and my wife thinks I'm, for the first time, a financial genius. [Laughter]
She's giving him all the credit. She said  she said darling, I love you so much and he said yes, I'm a great financial wizard. [Laughter] But he said you're looking  you're just making me look so good, and all of you  who has 401Ks here? I guarantee you one thing, I have your vote. I guarantee it. [Laughter] Of course, if the fake news did a poll, they're called suppression polls. [Booing]
You know, polls are fake, just like everything else. [Booing] If the fake news did a poll, it would show that I'm only getting 25 percent with the 401K people, even though they're up 44 percent. No, we got  we're doing well. We're doing well, and I'm happy you're doing well.
They just came out with a poll  did you hear? The most popular person in the history of the Republican Party is Trump. Can you believe this?
So I said, "Does that include honest Abe Lincoln?" You know, he was pretty good, right? Remember, I said, when I'd be a little bit wild, and we'd have a lot of fun, they'd say, "He's not acting presidential," and I'd say, "Well, it's a lot easier to act presidential than to do what I do." Anybody can act presidential.
Ladies and gentlemen of the state of Florida, thank you very much for being here. You are tremendously people, and I will leave now, because I am boring you to death. Thank you.
No, but I said, "I can be  " I used to tell them all the time, the fake news, I'd say, "I can be more presidential than any president in history, except for possibly Abe Lincoln with the big hat." I  I don't know about that. Abe  Abe looked pretty presidential, right? What do you think? He's tough. He's tough. I admit it: Abe Lincoln is tough. But we love Abe Lincoln.
One of these guys, when that poll came out  most popular  and it was in the 90s. And one of these guys is on television. You know, can't miss a word. Can't miss a word. Every  they see the poll. "Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Look at this. Oh, my God." Yeah, seven more years, seven more.
Seven more. "Oh, my God. We've got to find something. We've got to do anything  anything  to get him out. He's doing too well. This is not good."
Worst of all, Democrats want to  you know that. They want to open our borders. They want to let crime, tremendous crime into our country. We can't do it. [Booing]
Republicans want strong borders and no crime; Democrats want open borders, which equals massive crime. And on top of that, the Democrats  Nancy Pelosi, the whole group, Maxine  Maxine. She likes me a lot. She likes me a lot. [Booing] They've launched outrageous attacks on our incredible law enforcement officers, and on ICE and our Border Patrol, can you believe it? [Booing]
People that keep us safe. Their new platform, what they want to do  the Democrat Party, they want to abolish ICE. So in other words, they want to let MS-13 rule our country. That's not going to happen. [Booing]
Every day, the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities and towns from savage gangs like MS-13 that are occupying our country like another nation would. We want maximum border security and respect for our heroes, ICE, Border Patrol and law enforcement. And we're going to have tremendous border security that will include the wall  that will include the wall.
Now a lot of people don't know it but we've already started the wall. We got $1.6 billion and we've started large portions of the wall, but we're going to need  even the way we negotiate, we're going to need more and we're going to get more and we may have to do some pretty drastic things, but we're going to get it.
Because the Democrats  the Democrats are not voting for what we want to do and they're not voting and allowing our values to take place in our country. [Booing]
We're tracking down the gang members and we're tracking down the drug dealers and the child predators and the criminal aliens and we're throwing them in jail or throwing them the hell out of our country. In some states, Democrats are even trying to give illegal immigrants the right to vote. They want to give them the right to vote. [Booing]
Yeah, what about all of those people that are waiting in line for 7, 8, 9, 10 years trying to get into our country, they don't have the right to vote. We believe that only American citizens should vote in American elections -- Which is why the time has come for voter ID like everything else, voter ID.
You know, if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card, you need ID. You go out and you want to buy anything, you need ID and you need your picture. In this country, the only time you don't need it in many cases is when you want to vote for a president, when you want to vote for a senator, when you want to vote for a governor or a congressman, it's crazy, it's crazy. [Booing]
But we're turning it around. Remember I said it's awfully early to be thinking this, but I always think it, remember the attack on Merry Christmas, they're not attacking it anymore. Everyone is happy to say Merry Christmas, right? Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas. That was under siege. You have these big department stores they say, "Happy Holidays." I say, "Where is the Merry Christmas?" Now they're all putting up Merry Christmas again and that's because  only because of our campaign.
And by the way, the evangelicals and Paula White, Pastor Paula White, the evangelicals have been so amazing to us. They came out and they voted 84 percent and doubled and tripled the numbers that ever voted in an election before. We love the evangelical Christians.
If you want safety, if you want borders, if you want to have a country, then you need to go out and vote Republican. And very importantly, you need to go out and vote for Ron DeSantis for governor of Florida.
The lobbyists and special interests fighting against my administration, many of them are globalist. They care what happens in other countries. I care what's happening in the USA. [Audience chants] They're the geniuses who came up with our terrible trade deals one after another, how about NAFTA, remember when they signed NAFTA? [Booing]
Remember they signed NAFTA and everybody just moved their companies down to Mexico and these people were saying, "Isn't that a wonderful thing?" No, it's not a wonderful thing and those companies are now moving back.
These are the people who lost trillions of dollars overseas and who gave us our horrible immigration laws. These laws are the worst. I am for America first and the American worker. We want to be a puppet for no one any longer. We're not going to be a puppet any longer.
My only special interest is you, the citizens of the United States. I've had a great career. I've got a lot of fun, even in Florida, I've had a great career, I've had a lot of fun. I've done great. I've done really well, beyond anything I could've ever expected. And then I ran for president with no experience and I won. Isn't that -- But you actually won.
You know, I told the story the other day, I was probably in Washington in my entire life 17 times. True, 17 times. I don't think I ever stayed overnight. You know what I'm getting at, right? And we have a great cabinet now, a couple of little changes. But we have a great cabinet. We have  Mike Pompeo, our Secretary of State. So many great people. And we're really getting  we have just incredible people.
But I made some choices that I wouldn't have made. But I'm riding down Pennsylvania Avenue. Again, I've only been here about 17 times. And probably seven of those times was to check out the hotel I'm building on Pennsylvania Avenue and then I hop on the plane and I go back. So I've been there 17 times, never stayed there at night. I don't believe. And then I'm riding down in this beautiful car, picked up at the airport by Secret Service, holding the hand of our great first lady.
And I look at her and I say, "Honey, guess what, I'm president of the United States!" President of the United States. And I didn't know anybody in Washington, but now I know everybody in Washington. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the wonderful people and I know the scum. And America now is winning again like they haven't won before.
We passed the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history, biggest cuts in history. More than 100 utilities have slashed rates for consumers including right here from Duke Energy and Tampa Electric. Your rates have gone down.
Over $300 billion poured back into the United States in the first quarter, and we expect to be taking back because of our new tax cut and reform plan that passed bigger than anything ever in our country. We expect to be taking back from overseas over $4 trillion. That's a lot of money  could never have come back before.
And if our opponent had won and the Democrats had won, they would've put more regulations on. They would've raised your taxes. They would've opened your borders, gotten rid of law enforcement. They would not have helped your military. And you know what? Our country would be going to hell.
And instead of going up, the market would be half of what it was if we're lucky, because frankly the tax cuts were incredible to what we've done. But maybe even more important are the cuts in these horrible regulations that didn't allow anybody to do anything, job-killing regulations. We've gotten rid of more regulations than any president in the history of the United States. And that's done in less than two years. I withdrew the United States from the unfair one-sided very, very expensive job-killing Paris Climate Accord.
We repealed the core of Obamacare. The individual mandate is gone. You know, the individual mandate. That's a beauty. Only the past administration could have come up with this. That's where you pay a lot of money for the privilege of not paying in order to have poor health care. Other than that, it's a wonderful thing.
So you pay all this money for the privilege of not having to pay and the health care is no good to start off with. And we're doing great on health care. We're allowing Americans to buy better health care for less money through association health plans, including across state lines, bidding, you're getting tremendous competition. We passed the biggest VA reform in half a century, Veteran's Choice. If our veterans can't get the care they need from the VA, they will have the right to go see a private doctor. We'll pay for the doctor. And frankly, we'll save a lot of money. We'll help a lot of vets.
Everybody said they've been trying to get it for 45 years, everybody said you can't get it. Think of it. Think of it. Veterans Choice, they have to stand  our great people. These are our great people. Who's a veteran in this audience? Do you like Trump? Do you like the job we're doing?
Now, think of it, 45 years, everybody said you'll never get it passed. And I used to say before I really was well-versed on the veteran situation in health care, I used to say all the time, "Why don't they just let the folks go to a doctor?" They'd wait in line for 7 days, 9 days, 14 days, 21 days. Some of them started off with a very modest problem. They end up being terminal because they can't see a doctor.
I said, "Why don't they just let them go see a local private doctor, pay the bill and take care of it?" It will be a lot less expensive. And it's turned out to be something that the veterans love. And it's passed. It's passed.
They've been trying to get it passed for 38 years. The other one is 45, and that's VA accountability. If somebody treated our veterans badly, if they stole, if they was  if they were  you know this, if they were sadistic, if they were really bad to our vets, all right? Really, really bad, we couldn't do anything about it. They could steal. They could rob. They could be abusive. You couldn't say, "You're fired." Now you can say, "You're fired."
Made a big difference. That was another one they said you'll never get it done between civil service and unions. We love them both. But between civil service and unions they said, "You'll never get it done. You'll never get it approved." And by the way, we had virtually no help, very little from Democrats. Very little. Not because it's not right, but because they don't want to give Trump any victory. They'll do everything that's wrong.
Look at Judge Kavanaugh. This is a great, great highly respected man. And the good news is the Republicans, I believe, are close to a hundred percent, which is what we need. But so far, the Democrats haven't given us any votes, and that's because they will do anything they can to not help the Trump agenda, even though they know it's wrong. [Booing]
And Brett Kavanaugh, highest education, best grades, best tests, best everything. They thought 15 years ago he was going to be a Supreme Court judge. Look at Justice Gorsuch, how good is he? How good is he?
So we're getting them through. But it's not easy because they really are. You know, their term that they use is, "resist." It's actually resist and obstruct. Whatever they can do to resist and obstruct. And frankly, they're lousy politicians. They have horrible policy. The one thing they're good at, they stick together and they obstruct. And it's unfortunate.
You know, we have almost 400 people trying to get into government, many of whom have left their jobs and the Democrats are holding them up with maximum delay. They're holding them up, not allowing these great people to serve their country. It's a disgrace. That's Chuck Schumer, and it's a disgrace. It's a disgrace. But we'll get that Supreme Court judge, and that's the big one. That's the big one.
Really important for those who love our military, we have secured a record $700 billion for our military with another $716 billion next year all approved. And this is great news for the incredible patriots at MacDill Air Force Base, the proud home of the Sixth Air Mobility Wing U.S. Central Command and Special Operations Command. Come on! We're adding nearly 30,000 new soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and we have secured the largest pay raise for our great warriors in a decade.
I've also directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating the sixth branch of our military, the space force  building the space force. And we're doing well in North Korea, although I happen to think that we're doing so well with China that China maybe is getting in our way. But we're going to figure that one out before you can even think about it.
But we're doing well in North Korea. We have our  as you know, we have our hostages back. There's been no nuclear testing. There's been no missiles or rockets flying beautifully over Japan. I think our relationship is very good with Chairman Kim, and we'll all see how it all works out. But there's nothing like talking, and we'll see how it is. You remember when I first took office? It really looked like big trouble.
In the past administration, they thought that was by far their biggest problem. So I think it's going to work out very well. But a lot of good things are happening. No tests. No rockets flying. But we'll see what happens.
And our Vice President, Mike Pence, is going to Hawaii to bring back the remains and to greet the families of our great heroes who gave their lives in Korea. Our fallen warriors are finally coming home to lay at rest in American soil. [Audience Chanting]
I also withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided, $150 billion was paid  $1.8 billion in cash. The Iran nuclear deal, it's a horror show. I hope it works out well with Iran, they're having a lot of difficulty right now. I hope it works out well. And I have a feeling they'll be talking to us pretty soon. And maybe not and that's okay too.
In December, I recognized Israel's true capital, Jerusalem. And in about five months we opened already the American embassy in Jerusalem. And people had that scheduled for anywhere from five to ten years and you all know the story. We took an existing building. We played around with it. We renovated it. We fixed it up. We use Jerusalem stone, one of the finest stones actually in the world, Jerusalem stone. So, instead of spending 1 billion and the papers were right in front of me  sir, would you please approve this? What is it? This is for the embassy in Israel, American, sir. I said, "How much?" "$1 billion, Sir. 1 billion!"
I immediately called our great ambassador to Israel, David Friedman  very successful man, great lawyer, one of the most successful lawyers in the country before he decided to do what he's doing. I said, "David, they want us to pay a billion dollars for the embassy. I don't want to pay a billion dollars." I said, "Study it  do you have any buildings that we own?" We own so much we don't even know what the hell we own. "Find some building in a great location. Call me back."
Called me back two days later. He said, "Mr. President, Sir, we own the best site in Jerusalem. It's big. It's beautiful and it's got a building on it. I can take that building and renovate it. I can do it for $140,000."
I said, "David, how good is the site?" "We could never buy a better site." They were willing to spend tens of millions for a site. They wanted to buy a site which was so bad. It was totally inferior to what we already had. Don't forget, we get there first, right? You know, we have good sites.
And I said, "David, do me a favor, don't make it $140,000. Sounds too cheap. Make it like 400,000. That's okay too, David." So we saved almost a billion dollars. I could tell you these stories all day long, airplane purchases. I could tell you all day long.
And we started working  and for $400,000, we actually have a very beautiful American Embassy in Jerusalem  really beautiful. Now, that's one I guarantee no other president is doing. Can you imagine crooked Hillary doing that? Can you, honestly? Can you imagine? [Booing, Audience chants Lock her up]
In all fairness  in all fairness to her, could you imagine anybody else doing that? Nobody else. Nobody else is going to do that. And I could tell you stories about what we've saved with purchases of military equipment, General Mattis would be glad to tell you  but he can't believe it. And some of the generals have said they've never seen anything like it in the world  they've never seen. Because I want that $700 billion properly spent.
If we can buy twice the number of aircraft or have a lot of money left over that's what we want. Instead of apologizing for America we're standing up for America. We're standing up for the heroes who protect America and, yes, we are proudly standing up for our great national anthem. [Audience chants USA]
With every promise we keep, every record we break, every factory we open, we are restoring American strength and American pride. But to continue this incredible moment of this incredible movement  and that's what we have, we have a movement. This may be, in fact it probably is, the greatest movement in the history of our country. Even they will say that. Even they will say that.
But to keep it going we need to elect more Republicans. We need more votes. And we need to elect Ron DeSantis as your governor. Got to do it. And I'm telling you, I know him well, he's a great, great guy. He is going to be an incredible governor, I have no doubt  I have no doubt. I don't do these endorsements easily. I don't need to be here but I happen to love this state so it (inaudible).
And I don't do them easily. Although, it seems to have an impact. The other day we endorsed a great gentleman from Georgia. He was probably five points down. He won the election by 40 points.
He got 70 percent of the vote  the 30 (ph), think of that. Great guy. And many others. I mean, we could go over one after another, after  they're actually starting to give us credit for this. I don't think there's ever been anything like it.
That's why I had to be here to formally  you know, I've been endorsing Ron, I've been saying great things but I wanted to be here to formally endorse Ron, you got to get out and vote.
Thank you, Ms. DeSantis, thank you. Thank you. Beautiful family. Get your friends, get your colleagues, get your neighbors and get out and vote in November. You've got to do it because, remember, we're going to win this primary but don't take any chances. Nice lead  nice lead. Don't take any chances. And then about, give yourself about 10,15 minutes of happiness and then go back to work for November.
Because we have to remember they're putting up  I know some of the candidates, these are people that don't care about stopping crime. These are people that don't care about people pouring into our country when they shouldn't be here.
They don't care about stopping drugs from poisoning our youth and pouring over the border, they don't care. [Booing] Your future governor cares. And your current governor cares, Rick Scott.
Loyal citizens like you, incredible people from the great state of Florida helped build this country. And, together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to where it belongs, the American people.
This state was settled by pioneers and visionaries who explored the marshes and raised up cities right on the sea. This state was built by red-blooded American patriots who opened the force Naval Air Station at Pensacola and launched the first brave Americans soaring into the heavens. We stand on the shoulders of generations of proud Americans who knew how to work, knew how to fight, and knew how to win. Win.
And you know, when you elect Ron DeSantis as your governor  because you see it already, we're winning so much. Some people are getting a little tired of winning, right?
Well, by then it will be another year and two years and three years and you'll be insisting, Governor DeSantis, please see our president, it's too much winning. We can't  we can't stand it. The people of Florida, we can't stand it.
Because under previous administrations we never won. We got used to never winning. And he's going to come to me, in Washington, in the Oval office  the beautiful Oval Office  and he's going to say, Mr. President, the people of Florida are just down-right tired of winning, they can't stand it. [Booing]
It's just too much, Mr. President. The economy is too good. The jobs are too strong. We're doing too well, is there anything you can do? I'm going to say, "Ron, I don't care what you say, we're going to keep on winning."
We're going to keep on winning. We're going to win so much and the people of Florida actually love, don't they? They love it. Remember what I said right at the beginning, we're respected again. And that man is respected and always has been. We will never give up. We will never give in. We will never, ever back down and we will never, ever surrender. Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue.
We are one people. We are one family. And we are one glorious nation under god. And together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again! Thank you Florida! Thank you.
Hello, Kansas, thank you very much. Hello, Kansas. Thank you. And I'm thrilled to be here with all of my friends on this truly historic night. This is a historic night. I stand before you today on the heels of a tremendous victory for our nation, our people, and our beloved constitution. Just a few hours ago the U.S. Senate confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court, and I proudly signed the judge's commission aboard Air Force One just before landing.
And this Monday night, at 7:00 pm in the East Room of the White House, We will perform the swearing in ceremony for soon-to-be Justice Kavanaugh, a great man. And he will sit proudly alongside Justice Neil Gorsuch, who's doing a great job to uphold your sacred rights and to defend your God-given freedom.
And I want to thank our incredible Republican senators for refusing to back down in the face of the Democrats, shameless campaign of political and personal destruction. Since the moment Brett Kavanaugh was senate, and you remember this, we made an announcement and since right from the moment we announced, radical Democrats launched a disgraceful campaign to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy, right from the beginning.
Brett Kavanaugh is a man of great character and intellect. He's a totally brilliant scholar, who has devoted his life to the law, he is a loving husband, a devoted father, and a faithful public servant, and he always has been. What he and his wonderful family endured at the hands of Democrats is unthinkable, unthinkable.
In their quest for power, the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob, you saw that today with the screaming and the shouting, not from the 200 people or less that were --  You know what? Those people, they couldn't fit in the front row, look what we have here today. They threw away and threw aside every notion of fairness, of justice, of decency and of due process.
Nobody's seen anything like it. What each of you will have a chance in just four weeks to render your verdict on the Democrats conduct at the ballot box. Got to vote, got to vote.  On November 6th, you will have the chance to stop the radical Democrats, and that's what they've become, by electing a Republican House and a Republican Senate. We will increase our majorities. We need more Republicans, we need more Republicans.
Over the past few weeks, every American has now seen the profound stakes in the upcoming election. You now see it. We have been energized, we have been energized. if Democrats are willing to cause such destruction in the pursuit of power, Just imagine the devastation they would cause if they ever obtained the power they so desperately want, and Greg. You'll going to have other Supreme Court justices places to be filled it could be three, it could even be four, it could be a lot.
And if you allow the wrong people to get into office, things could change, they could change, and they could change fast. And we're not going to let that happen, we can't let that happen. It could go very quickly, it can change very fast, we can't let that happen. You don't hand matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry leftwing mob, and that's what they've become. The Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern.
Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob. We're doing a hell of a job of doing it, we're draining the swamp and we want to defeat the Democrats conducively. So under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving, America is winning because we are finally putting America first, we are putting America first.
Yesterday it was announced that unemployment has fallen to 3.7%, the lowest  unemployment rate in 50 years, lowest in 50 years. We've created nearly 600,000 jobs in the last three months alone, think of that, 600,000, and if I ever said that, when I was campaigning, the fake news media would go, I'd say, "Impossible." They are fake.
Manufacturing confidence is at an all-time high. Confidence, very important, all-time high. And we have the best economy in the history of our country, the best.We're taking care of our veterans, protecting our great seniors, and rebuilding America's military might like it hasn't been built before. But if Democrats take control, they will try to plunge our country into gridlock poverty and chaos, and that's what's going to happen, it can change.
The Democrats want to significantly raise your taxes. Essentially, they want to impose socialism, Venezuela, dismantle law enforcement and eliminate our borders. They want to have nice, open borders, no way. Bill. The Democrats have become the party of crime, they have become the party of crime, think of it. Republicans are the party of law and order, and justice.
And we really have become, even more so, than ever before the party of opportunity and wealth, and that's what's happening with creating wealth for everybody. Whether it's small businesses big businesses or people wanting great jobs, that's what's happening. And you know wages? Right now, for the first time in 19 years, wages are going up for people, and jobs. you can choose the job you want for the first time. Many years.
So we are thrilled to be joined by a number of your state's terrific Republican leaders. And  I have to tell you that I wasn't supposed to be here because, you know, this is such a big day. This is such a big day. I was supposed to call you, they said, "Do you mind calling Kris Kobach and Steve Watkins? Do you mind telling them?
That because of the fact that we are, today, getting this great, great, talented, wonderful Supreme Court judge. They said, "Could you call the people of Kansas and tell them we won't be able to make it tonight.?" I said, "I don't have the courage to do that. I don't have the courage" I said, "I don't have the courage." They call me, they said, "Sir, we're signing the next United States Supreme Court justice."
They always say, you've heard it. The biggest thing a president can do, they've always said, is Supreme Court justice the biggest, and some of it none. We've had two in less than two years, I guess, you know, some of [Inaudible] some presidents have it. But it's the biggest thing you can do so they said, "Sir, do you mind canceling Kansas tonight? We're going to have -- " I said, "No way I'm canceling Kansas. No way. No way."
I had that phone working, I had that phone working on that plane, I had that signature going on the plane, and here we are. And by the way, you think this crowd inside is big, you could see the crowd that's outside. We just put up big movie screens but I think this is better, right? This is better. I want to thank Congressman Roger Marshall, has been a great friend.
Roger has been a great friend, and a great friend also, Ron Estes, great person. He helped us so much with the tax cuts, with regulation cuts, with so many things that we've passed that nobody thought would be possible, would be possible. So thank you both very much. Where are they? Where are they? Thank you very much, fellas, thank you. Fantastic
And also, I want to thank somebody who's done a fantastic job, GOP Chair Kelly Arnold. Kelly? Great job. You know why a great job? Because we won this state by a lot, right?  And after what I just did for you with the new deal with Mexico and Canada, I think we should double it up, I think we should double it up. USMCA, USMCA. I refused to call it NAFTA because NAFTA was such a horrible deal.
You didn't even realize it, that was so --  50,000 plants and factories emptied out, millions and millions of jobs lost, so we negotiated a new deal, and I said,  "There's no way of calling it NAFTA 2, USMCA. And we opened up -- we opened up agriculture, we opened up dairy, we opened up a lot of things and everybody's really happy.
I don't know how they're doing in the other places but they're really happy. So congratulations. Congratulations. And we also signed a great new deal with South Korea and the farmers are going to be benefiting there too. And we're working -- Right now they  want to make a deal. I said,  "You're not ready to make a deal yet." We're working on a deal with China.
We'll see. Well see. Well see. Look, they've been hitting us hard for a long time. We've never had a president that did anything about it. $500 billion a year, that's a big one. They take out. So right now we're doing extremely well with China, and let's see what happens. Maybe we'll do it and if we don't we're going to be in even better position, you understand that. So we'll see.
I also want to thank a man of incredible integrity and class, your governor, Jeff Collier. Jeff? Jeff? Where's Jeff? Jeff is a great guy who's doing a really incredible job and thank you, Jeff. But I didn't know Jeff. I told Jeff, I said, "Nothing personal, I just didn't know you because when I backed Chris and you have one hell of a governor." And I think we have to talk about bringing him down to Washington or something. We talked about it.
Great governor, great man. We're also joined by Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt. Thank you. And president of the Kansas State Senate Susan Wagle. Susan. Thank you, Susan. I'm so proud that our Campaign Manager Brad Parscale, you know Brad, Brad Parscale. Where's Brad? Guy's like 7 feet tall, so you can't miss him. Thank you, Brad.
Our chief, our chief you know him, our Chief Operating Officer Mike Glassner. You know Michael? He's fantastic right from the beginning. Thank you, Michael. They all come from Kansas. They all come from Kansas. I guess that's how we win, you get from Kansas you wouldn't lose them. Along with our amazing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He is doing a great job.
He's headed over to North Korea. This guy travels, boy you got to do that to be a good one. You know, if you're home a lot you're not doing much of a good job. We're doing a great job with North Korea we're doing a great job with everybody. Mike Pompeo from Kansas. Great man. And also here with us tonight is your next lieutenant governor, Wink Hartman. Thank you, Wink. Thank you, Wink.
So a man that's been with me from the beginning, he's tough, he's strong and I hated that he ran because I would have loved to have brought him into my administration, effectively loses, I'll bring him into my administration in two seconds. I hope he loses because I want him so badly. But don't do that.
Don't you. Don't do that. I was angry when he did it. I said, "Don't do it." "Sir, I want to be the governor of Kansas. I love my people." I said, "Don't do it. Don't do it." I was very unhappy. I was very, very unhappy. I said, "Don't do it." Then he went out and he's been winning and he's been doing an incredible job. But he does, he loves this state. He loves the state so much and I want to introduce the next governor of Kansas, Kris Kobach.
Well let me just say on behalf of all of Kansas, President Trump, welcome to Trump country. It is such an honor and a blessing to have President Trump here in the city where I grew up to support my campaign in the state that we all love. And I want to give President Trump credit for something really important, it's something he and I have worked together on. We've worked for a number of things but the most important is stopping illegal immigration.  I'm so glad that America has a president who gets it and knows that illegal means illegal.
I want to tell you a quick short story about illegal immigration. I began working on this issue when I was an adviser to John Ashcroft at the time of 9/11. I was there during 9/11, and we all remember how the world changed. But let me tell you something that you may not know. All 19 hijackers came into this country legally on temporary visas.
Five of them became illegal mostly by overstaying their visas. Four of those five were stopped by state and local law enforcement for speeding violations. They were illegally in the country at the time but the cops didn't know it, and so they could -- they didn't make an arrest even though they could have if they'd had that information at their fingertips.
Now get this. Three of those for pi -- the three of those for illegal aliens that they could have arrested were pilots. So if they had made those arrests they could have stopped 9/11 from happening. Those numbers have shaped my career. The gravity of that has never left me and I will not and I know President Trump will not allow our immigration system to be used again as a weapon to harm the American people.
Stopping illegal aliens is not just about jobs, it's not just about crime. i's about our nation's security, and that comes first. And illegal immigration is an issue in this campaign for governor. Did you know that my opponent Laura Kelly voted to continue allowing sanctuary cities in Kansas? She did. She did. Look it up. It's in the roll call vote.
When I am governor, God willing, sanctuary cities will end in this state. Laura Kelly also voted to allow illegal aliens to continue getting welfare benefits. So while we're struggling to pay our electricity bill to pay higher taxes, we're meanwhile giving taxpayer dollars to illegal aliens. Is that fair? It's time to stop illegal aliens from getting taxpayer dollars.
It's time to put Kansans first, not illegal aliens. There's another big issue. [Crowd cheering] There's another big issue that President Trump and I have both been concerned about. Voter fraud. Because of the law that I drafted in the Kansas legislature passed, Kansas now has the most secure election laws in America. Photo ID creates trust in our elections.
If you need a photo ID to cash a check or to buy the kind of Sudafed that works, you probably going to need one to go cast a vote in an election. And proof of citizenship too, proof of citizenship. Every time an alien votes, every time an alien votes, it cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen. The Democrats and their socialist friends, they claim they care about voter cancellation or voter suppression, but they don't care about us citizens votes being canceled out.
It's time for other states to require proof of citizenship too, just like Kansas. One more, one more topic. Taxes. Thanks to President Trump, our federal tax burden is much lower. But in Kansas, our state taxes are the highest in the region. It's time to cut our state taxes here in Kansas. When I am governor, the first bill that I want to sign is one that passes along the Trump tax windfall to the people of Kansas.
$137 million. And on top of that, you've got thousands of Kansans being taxed out of their own home because of property tax appraisal increases, they can't afford to live in the home they wanted to retire in. When I am governor we will put a 2$ cap on property tax appraisal increases.
To put it simply, I want to do for Kansas what President Trump has done for America. [Crowd cheering] We've got a big election, a big election ahead of us on November 6th. It's a point of choice, not only for America but a big decision for Kansas. Tonight, President Trump is here calling on us to get out there and vote, calling on us to stand up, the time is now. To stand up for the proven principles and constitutional rights that have made this country great and made this country strong.
And the time is now, that we must reject the political correctness that the progressives and the left are constantly putting on us. And stand up, and stand up for the time-tested values of hard work, faith in God and the United States Constitution. Thank you, President Trump, for making America great again. And now we're going to make Kansas great again.
Thank you. What a job he did for me, I'll tell you, what a job he did. He's going to be a great governor. He will do the job for you. He is going to be a great, great governor. He is a tireless champion for border security. He'll fight for you every single day. He doesn't stop. He'll protect your family, he'll protect your children.
Now his far-left opponent is Laura Kelly. Voted to raise your taxes. And she supports giving public benefits to the illegal aliens [Inaudible. And Laura Kelly earned an F. And never even heard of an F. An F-rating from the NRA. An F. I assume that means that she's not too big on the second amendment, is that way? How would that be? Everybody get out and vote for my friend Kris Kobach on Election Day, please.
Finally, I want to introduce another terrific Republican candidate, your next congressman. Get out and vote. I need him in Washington. Steve Watkins. Steve is a great veteran. He's a patriot, and a proud West Point graduate, that means he's very smart. Steve, come on up.
Hey. Kansans can do anything. I'm proof of that. I. Grew up a couple of miles away. And here I am standing next to the leader of the free world. And not just any leader, a truly great one. You see, when I left -- when I left Kansas I went among other things I spent eight years in war zones, eight years with my boots in the sand of Iraq and Afghanistan.
Eight years. And in all that time -- all that time I really just learned a couple of things, I know for sure that I have seen the devil, but I have also seen fighters, Donald Trump is a fighter. He fights. He fights for America first, he fights to keep our borders secure, he fights for jobs he fights to those [Inaudible] approaching retirement.
He is a fighter and we are so honored to have him here in Kansas. He moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Yes. He likes -- he likes appointing pro-constitution judges to the bench. And he is tough on China, Iran, and North Korea. Do other things, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. Now Kansas, Kansas, you know, might be a little partial, but just think how much more he could have accomplished if he were a Kansan.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for all that you do, for Kansas, and for America ,and for this world. We're so glad you're here. Thank you, sir.
Good man. Good man. And a vote for Steve is a vote for me and our agenda to make America great again. You know that agenda. A lot of hats. A vote for Steve's opponent, his name is Paul Davis. He's not good, he's not good, you know that, is a vote for a radical agenda of Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the legendary Maxine Waters.
Here in Kansas, his opponent Paul Davis voted time after time to raise your taxes and fees. And he voted to give public benefits to illegal aliens at work. If you want to stop Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker of the house, Nancy, let Nancy Pelosi. Woah, you better get out and vote for Steve Watkins, please. A majority of House Democrats have already sponsored a socialist takeover of healthcare.
The Democrats' plan would eviscerate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for 20 million seniors. We want to protect Medicare we will as Republicans protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it and paid for it. And we will always protract Americans with pre-existing conditions. We will take care of our great Americans with pre- existing conditions.
Today's Democrats have embraced radical socialism and open borders. If you don't have borders, you don't have a country, folks, you don't have a country. Every single Democrat. In the U.S. Senate has signed up for the open borders and it's a bill, it's called The Open Borders Bill. What's going on? And it's written by -- Guess who?
Dianne Feinstein. Remember the leaking, right? The leakin' Dianne Feinstein. "Did you leak? Did you leak, Dianne? Dianne, did you... " "No, no, no, I don't. No.No. I don't think. Wait. Did we leak? No, he said no, no we didn't leak." Oh. Was that the worst body language you've ever seen? Was that the worst? "No, I didn't leak. I didn't leak." No she didn't leak. That's what you're dealing with.
If the Democrats bill ever becomes law, a tidal wave of drugs and crime would pour into our nation like never ever before. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities that release violent predators and bloodthirsty killers like MS-13 into our communities. Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens
And Republicans stand proudly with the brave men and women of ICE, border patrol, and law enforcement. They wanted the fund ICE. Can you believe it? You know how tough  ICE is? When MS-13 sees ICE coming, they say, "Let's get out of here." But you know what? They can't, because they get caught, they get thrown, and they get thrown the hell out of the country. They can't.
They don't like that. The Democrats want to get rid of ICE. So these are great Americans. By the way, ICE, great Americans. They happen to be tough people. I think we need some tough people, they're tough. MS-13 doesn't like ICE and that's why I like ICE. But they really are, they're great Americans, they love our country and they're not treated properly,  they're not treated properly.
I've seen it in Long Island. They go into a community. I've grew up in that vicinity, I know every community out there. And they go into these communities and these are rough,  rough people, MS13, how they even come in and we stop them at the border but there's so many here from before us, from before us, and our laws are so bad and we're getting them changing stuff.
That's why we need more Republicans. But they come in and -- Long Island, we send ICE and they get in there and they get them out, and it's like we're liberating a town. In this day and age it's like in a war, where you know, you're a foreign invader -- a foreign invader, finally, is being taken out. They're liberating a country or liberating a city or town.
These people are liberating these towns, and you know the story, and you've heard it, it's all over. They cut people up because they don't want to use bullets, it's too fast and it's not painful enough. And then when I said. "Animals!" Nancy Pelosi said, "How dare you speak that way about a human being. How dare you."  Right? This woman just said it to me. She screamed out of the word animal, so how dare you call them.
They're human beings and not -- these are animals folks. These are animals. And we need law enforcement, and we need ICE and we need border patrol. These are great people. And if your community has a problem, don't worry about it just give us a call, we'll take care of it. Democrats are also fighting to give welfare and free healthcare to illegal aliens paid for by you, the American taxpayer. Thank you very much.
Republicans believe that the public benefits must be protected for the truly, needy Americans. Americans that need help, not illegal aliens. If you want safe. If you want a border. If you want America to remain a sovereign great country then you must organize, mobilize, register, and vote Republican.
We need more Republican votes. This election is about safety. And it's also about prosperity. Since the election, we have created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. And we've added nearly one-half million manufacturing jobs. Think of that. If I ever said that during the cam -- look how many. Oh, man, that you are getting more and more people back there.
Look how many reporters. Look. Wow, that's a lot. Wow. Wow. You know I call it? I call it the Academy Awards. That's the  Academy Award. You know we're doing great. Our new polls just came out. I had a poll, Rasmussen 51 or 52, they don't report that, they never report.
But you know -- and It's much higher than that because some people -- I don't know if I'm happy about this, they say when they don't want to talk about it that means they're voting for Trump, I don't know, am I supposed to be thrilled? But we'll take it, right? Well take it. That's what happened in 2016. A lot of people didn't want to talk about it and the pollsters puts it down. OK, so -- but now they learned, they learned their lesson. When they don't talk they had Trump voters.
All action. All action, no talk. African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in recorded history. African-American poverty has reached its lowest rate ever recorded. By the way, by the way, can you imagine during the debate if I have those stats, the best unemployment number ever for African-Americans. Best in terms of poverty ever in history for Africa.
How do you win? How do you beat us on that? It's only habit. It's habit. Because for a hundred years, African-Americans have gone with Democrats but now they're changing, and they're changing fast and they're coming for us. Thank you, Kanye West. Thank you, Jim Brown. Big Jim Brown. Thank you, Iron Mike. I could go through -- We have so many people.
Big Jim Brown. We could use him right now in the NFL, right? Great people. Hispanic- American and Asian-American, likewise, their unemployment rates have also reached all- time historic lows. The lowest. And women's unemployment just fell to 3.6%,  the lowest rate in 65 years. And we are, as of right now, the world's No.1 producer of crude oil and natural gas. Energy. No. 1.  No. 1. And since I took office, the value of Americans mutual funds and pension funds has increased by $2.7 trillion. That's your money, that's your money. And your 401(k)s. You all look like a bunch of geniuses, thank you, Donald, very much. You're all great investors, right?
You're all great investors. That's all good. We've picked up 11 -- I would say 10, I was saying seven. We picked up now 11.7% Larry Kudlow said it to me the other day, said, "Sir, you're a little lower in that number."  I said, "Really?" I was using $10 trillion. It's now $11.7 trillion in worth.
Eleven. You know what that is? And China was catching us rapidly before I became president. And right now we are going so fast, we are the fastest developing country in the world. Can you believe that? Boom. Fastest in the world. [Crowd cheering] And that's why I say, "We have a midterm coming up, an election." Historically whoever's president -- I don't know why this works, but whoever's -- I guess people get complacent.
You know, "Hey, we just won the presidency." Now two years later we have an election, so they are complacent and then we always win in the next one, which is, as you know, the presidential election. We always... So far I'm dreaming of those candidates. I see those candidates before my eyes.
Every night before I go to sleep, sometimes while I'm sleeping I love them so much. Cory Booker, Pocahontas, Pocahontas. I've got more Indian blood in me than Pocahontas, and I have none, I mean, sadly I have none, but I have more than she does. They said to her, "Why do you say you're of Indian heritage?" Well, my mother told my high cheekbones that's the answer.
Do you have any documentation? No, we don't. "Oh, I see. Your high cheekbones." Well I have high cheekbones too. Hey, maybe I'm an Indian and I'm going to do very well. But think of it. This is her reason. The whole thing has been [Inaudible] but that's OK. You know what, I want to be careful. I'm taking out so many of these people, I'm hitting them so hard that they're disappearing and I don't want to do that because I make it somebody that's actually good to run against me and that would not be good.
I'll take out all the easy ones and maybe I'll get stuck with somebody that's actually good,  but I don't see any on that side. Well, Sleepy Joe Biden, who -- who ran for president two or three times, you know they say only twice. I think I remember a third time in there. But he had 1% with an arrow pointing left.
That means 1% or less. And then Obama took him off the trash heap while he's one of the people. Remember he challenged me to a fight? "I'd like to take him behind the bar." I love that. That would be great. That would not last long. That would not last long. That wouldn't last long. Go like this. He's down. And he'll never get up. He will never get up. He will never get up. Now I got to leave their candidates alone.
Somebody actually said, "You're hitting these candidates really hard." He's a non-candidate, you know, Don Mandic. He's a Da Nang Dick. He's Da Nang Dick. That's  Blumenthal. He talked about, "When I was in Da Nang province in Vietnam and I was fighting up the hill in Minner going left and right of me they're dying.
They're being struck by bullets but I went back to their rescue. I went back and I got them. And then I made a second attempt and bullets are going left and right and over my shoulders and they're hitting my men." And I used to think, "Wow, this guy is a pretty brave guy."  And then I found out he's a fraud. He never was in Vietnam. And he stopped campaigning because there was no way you could win.
No way. And because it's Connecticut, where I guess only a Democrat -- Can you believe this? That's why Connecticut's such a mess right now. Only a Democrat -- Wait, you're going to see, it's a mess. General Electric just moved out. That doesn't help. But Da Nang and Dick and then I see him yesterday talking about a man who's No. 1 at Yale, has like this perfect record.
The most incredible record. One of the reasons I picked him. He's like a perfect person in Da Nang Dick, who -- who said he was a great war hero and he never saw the country. This wasn't like saying, "Yeah. I was in the army." This is -- this is the guy that said he was charged up Da Nang. Da Nang province right down Da Nang. He's up that hill and he's taking bullets left and right, and he never saw the place, he was in the reserves cell. Remember that.
And he said, "I demand honesty." This is true, exact words. I demand honesty, integrity and I demand that there's no lying going on, and I'm saying, "Wait a minute." I said,  "That's the guy that lied about -- in the worst -- in the history of our country. If you look at it,  he lied. And this is one of the people, how bad.
And then you have the Feinstein and you have all the others and you look at what's going on. You don't want those people in office, folks. You've got to have great Republican. And compare that with what you've seen with John Cornyn, who asked a great question to Dianne and got her a little off base, like you know John Cornyn of Texas.
And Lindsey Graham, who did such a great job. Right. Did a great job. How good was Lindsey? How good was Lindsey? And you know what? He was speaking from the heart. He was speaking. And by the way, took a week but that extra week was a great thing because it showed no corroboration, no nothing. By the way, no nothing. How good was Senator Susan Collins yesterday.
Really, really great. And Chuck Grassley. I'll tell you what, Chuck was great. He's got to be very happy with what we did on trade. Right, Chuck? From Iowa, great state. And Mitch McConnell, how good, how good? He was tough and smart. He was great. He worked hard and we got ourselves the finest legal mind. One of the finest human beings.
And again what his family took. The horror that they had to endure by these people like Blumenthal and Cory Booker who was a disaster as the mayor of Newark New Jersey. What they had to take was a disgrace. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you're tired of winning. All right. Tired of winning. We want to win, win, win. Never get tired of winning. After years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation. you see what's happening.
And I just left the United Nations last week, and I can tell you, and everybody else can tell you, and even the fake news can tell you, America is respected again. To create more jobs and rising wages. Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history by far.
We also passed Veterans Choice, 44 years, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor, and we pay for it so they don't have to wait in line for 25 days, 38 days, 14 days, six days. They go out and they see a private doctor, they get themselves a good doctor. We paid the bill. It's frankly so simple but it took 44 years to get it done.
We got it done. I'm going to getting it done. I'm good at getting it done.Now we also passed, this is 45 years, the VA accountability law to insure anyone who mistreats our veterans will be held accountable, you are fired, get out.
And we've secured a record, $700 million and the next year $716 billion to rebuild our military and to give our brave warriors the largest pay raise in almost a decade.
And at my direction, The Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces the space force, a very serious stuff. That's happening quickly, it's very serious, that's where it's at. You know you have to know where it's at. Doesn't sound right, but it's right. That's where it's at.
Both defense and offense that's where it's at. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. You know, before I became president, I looked at what was happening with Iran. They were taken over the Middle East, they were taking Syria. They were taking them.
They were going into Iraq, they were taking everything. Now, they just want to make it, they just want to -- say they have riots in every city. Since I took over that operation, that horrible, horrible deal that was the thick of it. The previous administration gave Iran $150 billion and even crazier, they gave him at $1.8 billion dollars in cash. Cash.
Airplanes. Airplanes full of cash. Fact I got in, I said, "This is the president of the United States. I actually have the power to give away $1.8 billion in cash?" You know what the answer is? It's actually no, they don't. What they did there is a disgrace. They gave them 1.8 in order to have a terrible deal.
Well that was a hostage so they paid $1.8 billion. They paid $1.8 billion for hostages. Can you imagine? And we got our hostages back from North Korea, right? Noting. Zero. And we have a good relationship. And who knows what happens? But I think good things happen. No more missile testing, no more rocket testing, no more nuclear testing.
We got the remains of our great, great heroes from 75 years ago back. And they keep coming back. And we got our hostages back. And good things are happening over there. You know what I always say is this, just before we signed the deal with Canada and Mexico, great deal, I said, "Who knows?" I never like to say -- how could you say? It's a deal.
Who knows? I like to do -- it takes all the pressure off. Who knows? With North Korea, who knows? But I think we're doing very well. OK? The fake news says, "Why aren't you going faster?" I said, Listen, I just got back three months ago, right. I was there with Kim Jong-un. I was there three months ago. Chairman Kim." They say, "Why aren't you going faster?
I said, "What have people done for 75 years? 75. This is three months." And one of the Akers said, "Why has the president given away so much? And I said, "What have I given? I haven't given anything." We've got our hostages back for nothing, out of respect. We got our remains back. We got the testing all stopped including the nuclear testing.
I said, "Tell me what have we given?" "Well, ah, ah, you -- you agreed to meet." Oh, that does cost me very much, I agreed to meet. I like to meet. I like to meet. What the hell we lose by meeting. I asked the previous administration. Now that's what I gave away, I agreed to meet. Can you believe it? These people are sick. I agreed to meet.
Can you imagine how well we do if we actually had fair press? Can you imagine? No, could you imagine? Instead of fake news. I agreed to meet. I'm sorry I agreed to meet. And then they said. right. You know, the rhetoric was extremely tough that first couple of months. And President Obama said at my meeting with him he said, "The biggest problem we have by far is North Korea."
They would have gone to war. Millions and millions of people would have been killed. Millions of people. And I said to somebody in their administration. Have you ever talked? Have you ever agreed to meet? Have you ever like sit down and talk? "Well we haven't thought about." Oh, I see you're going to war, you're not going to talk.
We'll beat anybody. What we have now coming in, I'm telling you it's the greatest power we've ever had, the greatest power in the world. You know why I have that? Because I don't want to use it. And when you have it, nobody is going to mess with us. OK. Nobody. I don't want to use it. Greatest power in the world.
$716 billion, greatest power in the world. But we're doing great. And we have recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. That's the other story I tell. That's the other story we tell. That's a big one. That's a big, big story. You know why? Because other presidents all said, there are many, many presidents, "We're going to do it. We're going to do it."
Then the pressure goes on and they don't do it. And I see why, I don't blame them. Every leader called me, "Don't do it, please. Don't do it, don't do it." You know the story I refused to take their phone calls.
I said, "Tell them I'll call them back on Thursday next week." And I'm signing like on Wednesday. Tell him I'm calling him back on Thursday. I look forward to speaking to him. I signed the deal. Now's the deal, then I call him back. "Yeah. Hi. How are you doing?  What's up?" Wow. "We wanted to talk to you about Israel but it's a little late."
And the embassy, which was going to cost over a billion dollars, we built it for about $400,000, right, you know that, right. And the billion would have taken probably 20 years before you ever got to build it. And we took a piece of land that we own, already own, and it had a building on it. OK building. We fixed the building up a little bit.
We took the big space in the corner. We used even Jerusalem stone, which is a very expensive if you're a building. Jerusalem stone is beautiful. How nice is that? And you know Jerusalem stone in Jerusalem sounds about right. We got it for the right price. And we built it for less than $500,000. Now think of it.
And we opened it up and it's open now, we have our embassy. So we saved a billion dollars in twenty years and we have our embassy. We could do that with hundreds of this. For years you watched as your leaders apologize for America and now you have a president who is standing up for America. We're standing up for your values. We're standing up for Kansas and we're standing proudly.
We're standing proudly for our great national anthem, right. I just helped Canada and the NFL make a deal that they've been trying to make for years. Can you believe it? Canada was taking advantage of the NFL. The NFL couldn't get it done. It took me about two seconds because it's pea -- It's, you know, it's a lot of money but it's not compared to corn, and crops, and dairy, and milk, and cars, and steel, and everything else. It's peanuts. I say you got to take care of it right. Because I want to help American companies. It took me like two minutes and we get it done. And I got a call from the commissioner of the NFL and I thought he was calling me to ask me to stop haunting them about standing for the American flag and for our national..
And he didn't. He called me to thank me. He said, "The previous administration could not get it done. And you got it done. We didn't even know what you were trying to do it." So now they'll have a lot more money to give to their players and their players will still hate me, but that's OK. Stand for it, just as long as they stand. Just as long as they stand for our flag and our anthem I don't care how they feel about that.
But to continue our incredible momentum, you have to get your friends your family your neighbors your co-workers and get out and vote Republican, we need more people in D.C.. We don't have enough. Vote to send Kris Kobach to the governor's mansion and vote to send Steve Watkins to Congress. We always vote for Trump.
A vote for Republicans is a vote for lower taxes, less regulation, and more products made right here in the USA. Finally, finally. We want it made here. It's a vote to respect our borders, respect our constitution, and respect the heroes of law enforcement, and that's what they are. They're our heroes.
And a vote for Republicans is a vote to reject the Democrat politics of anger and division,  and destruction, and to reclaim America's true heritage and righteous destiny. We're losing that with these crazy loco people. To everyone in this room tonight, that's a lot of people, to every citizen watching across our land.
This is your time to choose. It's a time to choose whether we turn backward to the failure and frustration of the past or whether we continue forward into a future of American greatness. It's not up to the media. It's not up to the pundits. It's up to you to decide your fate.
And remember this, what happened in 2016, and what's happening even more so now, I believe, because I've produced, and people see I produced, one of them said, "He made a lot of promises and he actually produced more than he made promises."
I mean, you know, think about it. I did. I did. You have the power with your vote. To defend your family, your community, your country, and everything we hold sacred, and righteous, and true. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country, returning power to every day great American patriots.
The state of Kansas was set up by tough pioneer men and strong women, who defied danger and brave the wilderness to build a beautiful life on the plains. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Strong Women, strong women, strong.
I'm sorry, fellas, stronger than the men, I'm sorry, fellas. Strong. They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury but they all had one thing in common, they love their families, they love their country, and they loved their god.
These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy our proud and great American heritage. For the sake of our freedom and for the sake of our children we are going to work, we are going to fight and we are going to win, win, win.
We will not ban. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never surrender. And we will always fight on to victory. Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people. One Family. And one glorious nation under God.
And together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kansas. Thank you.
Well, thank you very much and hello Tupelo. This is great to be with you tonight, the great state of Mississippi, the great state of Mississippi, and by the way, the birthplace of a gentleman, not too many people heard of him, Elvis Presley. But to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in God, family, and country.
Four days from now, this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next Governor, Republican Tate Reeves. Great guy. Under Republican leadership, jobs are booming, confidence is soaring, wages are rising, crime is falling, and our nation is stronger than ever before.
We're now an economic powerhouse. We've never been in a position like it, we've rebuilt our military, and we have financial strength. And by the way, for those of you with a thing called 401(k)s, the stock market hit today another all-time historic high. Unemployment in Mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded, ever recorded.
That's not bad. That's not bad. When you're on the debate stage -- and you say we have the best economy we've ever had, we have the best military we've ever had, the best unemployment and employment numbers we've ever had. He said the best President we've ever had. Thank you. [Audience chants "Four more years"] Thank you very much.
And very importantly, we've confirmed more than 158 brand new beautiful federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written. In a very short while, we'll have 182 federal judges. President Obama left us 142. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Can you believe that?
You're supposed to leave none when you leave office, but that didn't work out too well. And just days ago, the United States brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice. [Audience chants "USA"] We have great military. It was very, very depleted. When I came into office it was very, very depleted, but it ain't depleted anymore.
Al Baghdadi, the founder, and leader -- look, you know, you've heard about him for a long time. I kept saying: where is al Baghdadi, that's the one I want. Where is he? And then, by the way, the following day we got number two. I don't know if you read about that, but he was the founder and the leader of ISIS, and he's dead.
And Baghdadi, he was a savage and soulless monster, but his reign of terror is over. American special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell. I guess you could say. He spent his last miserable moments on earth, cowering and trembling, and crying in fear of the American warrior that was right there, going right up. No enemy stands a chance against the righteous might of the United States military.
And Mississippi loves our military, that I can tell you, and our military loves Mississippi. America is winning again and America is all over the world, respected again. It's about time. But while we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Democrat Party has gone completely insane. [Audience Boos] The radical left is determined to transform America into a country you would not recognize.
We are the ones standing in their way and we will never get out of their way. It will be easy. From even before we won the election, the far-left Democrats and the fake news media, right back there. Look at all of them. Oh. [Audience Boos] It's too bad we didn't get such good ratings because if we didn't, they wouldn't be here.
Look at how many. It's like the Academy Awards before it failed, right? And do you know why it failed? Because they disrespected us. But the media and the Democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership trying to impose their will and to thwart American democracy by any means necessary. You see what's going on. First, they engineered the Russia hoax.
That was a total hoax. The single greatest lies ever foisted upon the American people. Then, the Muller witch hunt. It never ended. With 18 angry Democrats and an unlimited budget. Let's go get him. That didn't work out too well, did it? That fizzled. And a lot of bad people along the way. And now, corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi [Audience Boos] and shifty Adam Schiff, shifty, and the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt.
This is one I never thought I'd be involved in. The word impeachment to me, it's a dirty word, not a good word, totally phony deal, they know it, everybody knows it. And that's why we've never had greater support than we have right now. It's true. It's true. And if you think you have a lot of people in this room, all you have to do is go outside.
You'll see a lot more people trying to get in. So, if anybody wants to give up your seat, please just walk out -- anybody wants to leave? Because there really is, there's no place better to have a rally, to have a good time, and also, at the same time, be very serious, than at a Trump rally, especially on Friday night in Mississippi.
We could have done this one on a Monday night, I said let's do Friday, right? Friday. Yesterday, the Democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million Americans disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. [Audience Boos] They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won.
But the people here that are highly sophisticated, know long before, I won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, the horrible newspaper, fake, fake, fake Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. At least they gave us 19 minutes. Yesterday's vote by the radical Democrats is an attack on Democracy itself.
But I'll tell you, the Republicans are really strong. The strongest I've ever seen them. The most unified I've ever seen them. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, and extremism. The Democrats' outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing Democrats out of office in 2020. Make no mistake.
They are coming after the Republican Party and me because I'm fighting for you, they don't like it, this is different. They've never had anything like this. Well, they've never had an election like 2016 either, have they? They've never had. They've never quite figured it out. And they know they can't win.
So, let's try and impeach him. How about that crazy Representative Al Green, right? You know, we've got to impeach him because we can't beat him. I don't think so, right? I don't think so. Al Green, he's another beauty. The Democrats, the media, and the deep state are desperate to stop us. And it's not me, it's us, it's all of us. It's 63 million but it's much more than 63 million, much more, and right now, our numbers are higher than they've ever been before.
So, you know if they've never been -- they've never been this. But they want to stop us because they know we are here and that's what we're doing, and that's what's taken up so much time. We're draining the swamp in Washington. Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the fact that all of their spying, spying.
They actually spied on my campaign. Can you believe it? I mean, you know, they try to say well, we were actually just checking things out. Oh, that's wonderful. The lying, the falsifying over the past three years. Plus, before I ever even announced they were spying. I guess, they knew we were going to win, right?
But over that past more than three years is finally being exposed. And remember this, the truth is a force of nature. Desperate to conceal their misdeeds, the Democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the Bidens. Just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked Hillary's shocking and very many misdeeds.
33,000 e-mails, 33,000 e-mails disappeared, but she said they only had to do with her working out and her daughter's wedding. [Audience chants "Lock her up"] She's a beauty. How about last week, did you hear? I don't know who Tulsi Gabbard is, but I know one thing, she's, not an agent of Russia. And Jill Stein, she's a greenie, that's fine.
We love the environment, everybody in this room. You know right now, we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we've ever had, and yet, we're No. 1 in the world in energy by far. We took over. But I don't know Jill Stein, she ran last time. I don't know, but I know she's not an agent of Russia.
And when Hillary made those statements, two statements, both of them, they work for Russia, they're agents of Russia. I said you know when she made that statement about me three years ago, it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement. She made it about them, everybody laughed because of what we proved.
But I'll tell you what, these are very bad people. These are very dishonest people, and the media is worse than all of them. But think about the preposterous hoax the Democrats are now trying to peddle. I've just beaten with no political -- look, look, we didn't have too much political experience. I did a good job.
Built lots of buildings all over the place, had great success in show business, just did one show it's called The Apprentice and it was a big success, 14 seasons. And when I left, Crazy Arnold took over. It didn't do too well. It was dead. It was dead from the first episode. I saw him. I said, oh, it's terrible.
What have they done to this beautiful show, Arnold? But think of it. I've just beaten with no political experience, the Clinton dynasty, the Bush dynasty, the President Barack-Hussein-Obama dynasty [Audience Boos], and President Obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked Hillary Clinton did, right?
He was all over the place. The only time I've actually seen him work hard when it came to trying to beat Trump. It's true. Remember he said, remember he said, he will not be President. Well, that didn't work out so well. And then, they figured they could take us out a different way, very dishonestly, right?
With the lying, and the spying, and the leaking, and we are kicking their ass, I'll tell you. In the delusional Democrat fantasy, I'm now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1% Joe. I used to call him 1% because he could never get 1% percent in the primaries. Then, he got brought out by Obama out of the trash heap, became Vice President, but we've now named him very slow sleepy Joe, very slow, he's gotten slower and slower.
I'm afraid if he gets the nomination, he'll be so slow. We'll have the lowest-rated debates in history, as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history, against crooked Hillary. In fact, I don't even think that sleepy Joe will get it, but many people are running. So, you know, it's so early. I don't want to talk about their campaign.
Oh, did you hear Beto, Beto? Oh, that poor bastard. Well. Poor, pathetic guy. He was pathetic. Remember the arms are flailing. It's all -- remember that -- you know, he ran against Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz won. He spent almost $100 million, and Ted Cruz and I helped Ted, and we campaigned together, and it was good, but I used to watch him.
Then, when he came on to the really big stage, this crazy stage, I noticed he was flailing with the arms and he was standing on tables, he was standing on countertops. I said does he ever, like, stand on the floor and speak? But he's waving his arms and going crazy, and I said what the hell is he doing? What is he on? And you remember he made the statement that he was born for this.
Anybody that says, he was born for this, they're in trouble. You know, I used to have guys come into my office, sir, I'm the greatest salesman. Nobody can sell -- you know, the truth is, anybody that says they're a great salesman, usually, they're, not a very good salesman. It's true. It's those sneaky ones in the back that don't talk, but you don't know about -- they're the ones.
But Beto was nasty and he said that he was born for it. Like he was born from heaven and he came down. And if that's the case, some really bad things happened because he made a total fool out of himself. And he came out of Texas, the great state of Texas. He came out of Texas, a very hot political property and he went back as cold as you can be. So, he was a nasty guy.
But he had a couple of policies that don't work well in the state of Texas, right? He was against religion, he was against you having a gun [Audience Boos], and he was against oil. So, you come from Texas, you don't like religion, you don't like oil, and you don't have guns. I don't know, that's not a good combination in the state of Texas.
That's not good in Mississippi either. I don't know is that good -- is that good anyway. Now, he went back home to Texas, and hopefully, we won't be hearing about him for a long time. It's amazing how cold you can get so quickly, but he was a nasty guy. But in the twisted -- oh, Alabama. I love Alabama, I love Alabama.
It's a great place. But in the very twisted and corrupt world of Adam Schiff, after beating the entire political establishment, and that means Bush, and that means Clinton, and that means Obama. They have me supposedly saying to myself. Well, let's see, I got a guy named sleepy Joe Biden. How do I beat him?
How do I beat him? How do I beat this guy? He's such a great -- Clinton, she was easy, right? Obama was easy. The Bush dynasty was easy, but sleepy Joe I'm worried about, right? So then, I said to myself, gee, I guess, there's only one way. Let's call up Ukraine for help. These people are sick. These people are sick.
Now, these dishonest people will take the last little sliver and the first little sliver, and they'll put it because they're so damned dishonest, and they'll say let's use Ukraine for help. That's what they're going to say. And they won't show the laughter, and they won't show the sarcasm, and they won't show the fun because they're the most dishonorable people, almost, on Earth.
It's a disgrace. [Audience Boos] But we say it anyway. And here's the good news, the people get it. So, they have a brand new President in Ukraine, good guy by the way. And I call a brand new President, a man, I have no idea who he is. And I'm on a phone, right, and I know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of a country, many people listen.
And I'm on the phone, and they want me to say to this brand new President, he just got there, call to congratulate him. Please, could you help me, please? I don't know who he is. I didn't know his name until I looked down the card, I see, and he's a nice guy. And hopefully, he's going to root out corruption because Ukraine has tremendous corruption problems.
And hopefully, -- and one of the reasons I held up money, very important, corruption. But the other reason, why isn't Germany and France and U.K., and all of these European nations that are right there, why aren't they doing things that they're supposed to do? Why is it always the United States? So, I made this call, had this wonderful call, and the transcript proves it was, as I said, perfect.
It was perfect. It wasn't like, almost, it was perfect. It was totally appropriate. I made it at the behest of people to say, could you call and say hello. Now, I'm an honest person anyway, but do you think when I'm making a call to a newly elected President of a country that I would say something improper?
When I know there are so many people listening on the line, and many people. All of these people, you had the Secretary of State Pompeo, a great guy. He's listening. You had transcribers, fortunately. You had policy experts, junior age, low-level staffers, probably [Inaudible]. Whoever wants to listen, they listen, and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people.
And remember, the new President of Ukraine is speaking to the United States of America. The President, I guarantee he's got a lot of people listening too. These people are sick. So, corrupt politician, shifty Adam Schiff, actually stood before Congress and stood before the American people, and made up a conversation that he said I had with the Ukrainian President, unfortunately.
[Audience Boos] Now, think of it. And many people saw that and it was a terrible -- he said terrible things. The President of Ukraine said it was a very good conversation. There was no pressure, his foreign minister said the same thing, no pressure. They must think we're nuts, to be honest. It's all a phony deal.
This whole impeachment scam to try to undermine the 2020 election and to delegitimatize one of the greatest elections. Maybe the greatest -- I mean, let's give George Washington credit, but everybody expected he was going to win, that we've ever had. So, my phone call, which was totally perfect and appropriate, and if you want to read the transcript, you see how perfect it was, but they don't quit.
But what you should do is take a look at the behavior of sleepy Joe. So, I quote, I said -- let me act like him. I've got to speak really slow, though, and I said you're not getting a billion. I looked at them and I said, I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor isn't fired, you're, not getting the money, you understand?
You're not getting the money. Then, he goes at the end, I didn't know he had this kind of energy. He goes, well, son of a bitch, he got fired. You know in a certain way, I was impressed because I mean, I didn't think he had the energy, the brainpower. It's turned out he doesn't. By the way, he's dropping like a rock.
You know, when you're at 1% there's always a reason. He should be there fairly, sir. As you know, the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden got fired after threatening to withhold -- I think it was $1 billion or something -- and it was the prosecutor investigating his son's company that was paying Hunter Biden, a guy that just got thrown out of the Navy.
He was paying them millions of dollars, even though, working for an energy company, he had no experience with energy. He knew less about it than this young -- how old are you? Six, this young beautiful person in front of me. [Audience member calls out "Go, Donald, go"]Six and this young 6-year old is smarter.
So, I think I'd basically go with her. So, what is it all about? It's called a payoff. But you know what? The fake news they apologized. I watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings, Anderson Cooper [Audience Boos] Well, the hatred. I mean between him and Fredo, you get Fredo. That's Cuomo -- Fredo.
I call him Fredo like from the movie. Now, I watched Anderson Cooper and I watched him apologize for even asking the question to Biden. The good news is Biden didn't know too much about what the hell he was talking about. Remember Biden said I don't know these people. I don't know him. I don't know him. He never spoke to his son about getting millions of dollars.
No, he never spoke to him. He didn't happen to speak to him. Think of this. We're dealing with life, right? He never spoke to him. Unfortunately, the next day, you know in the world of the Internet, in the world of smart people. That's why I like Beto, he wasn't smart, couldn't handle it. I told my wife, I said see, it's not so easy.
I told our great First Lady tonight, who people love, they love her. When Beto quit like -- he quit like a dog. When he quit, I said see, people think this is easy. This isn't easy. But -- you know, it worked out that way. But Biden said I never met the people, never met the gentleman. Unfortunately, in about 10 seconds, a picture came out where they're playing golf together, but he never met him.
So now, you'll ask him he said, no, we played a round of golf. We were together for three hours. I never mentioned the fact that they're paying my son millions, no, no, no, but the press protects them. Watch this crazy Anderson Cooper, third rate, lousy ratings, third-rate person. But listen, CNN, the worst.
I mean the worst, the worst. [Audience Boos] Oh, their light just went off, see? What -- the light was on, they just -- they don't like it. You know it's tough. Your fake CNN -- [Audience Boos] No, it's tough. I tried not to do that because I see their light on. You know, when that light goes on that means you're live.
No, that means you're live, and every time -- it's tough. Look, in all fairness, they're putting it on, it's a broadcast, very few people are -- well, they might be watching us, I guess they do watch us. But here's the thing, and then, you have the guy up there saying that they're fake. That they're no good, that they're liars and cheaters, that they're phonies.
It's hard to be broadcasting that when you're talking about the network that has you on, right? So, we understand. The lights off. And then remember this, Anderson Cooper, what a beauty. He used to interview me. He was so nice. Prior to running for politics, he was so nice to me. It was like they were love fests, but I don't want anything to do with him.
They were love fests, so what a thought. He's weak. He's a weak person but they're all weak. But let me just -- let me just tell you something. We need honesty with our media. We need honesty. Because the New York Times, The Washington Post, and by the way, I don't know you probably read it -- we throw him out of the White House, we don't show him anymore.
If somebody wants to go and buy, we throw him out. And they came into my office, and then, I get -- I got to get back to this guy. Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? You know we had a T-shirt made where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? Poor Hunter. He then came out, he did the morning show. That was the last we've seen of Hunter.
That wasn't good. The morning of his father's very bad debate, but it's where is Hunter? But before I say the final thing on Hunter, and then, we put him to rest for a while. We got rid of the Washington Post and the failing New York Times. We got rid of them, right? We don't have them in the White House.
Now, you people can go out and buy it but we don't. We just have them stacked up -- and I go in and I'd see a meeting with my people, and they're dealing with China, South Korea or somebody, and I'd go in and go into these offices, and see like 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place. The Washington Post, the New York Times, I keep trying to figure out who's worse, and you know, one day it's the Times and it's the Post.
It's like they top each other. They're so bad. It's so phony. It's so -- in my opinion, it's virtually corrupt. I've never seen -- you never have a good story. I mean, even with -- when we got Al Baghdadi, the Washington Post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric. Where did that come from?
[Audience Boos] The other thing, if Obama would have done it because look, this guy built ISIS, the caliphate. It was the size physically of Ohio, the state of Ohio, the great state of Ohio. That's a big lot of land, 7 million people and they were the ones, the orange jumpsuits. I called a lot of the parents after we did this and I talked to them and they were, how can you be happy?
But they were so thrilled that we got this animal. They were so thrilled, but you know what, and you know what, we don't do it -- we do it because it's right. That story was a massive story. That was the biggest, maybe the biggest, one of the biggest ever, bigger than anything. That story disappeared so fast, gone, and that's OK. I didn't do it for the story.
I did it because it's the right thing to do, but if that were, if I were a Democrat, if I were a Democrat they'd be talking about that story for weeks. With me, they don't even want to -- you know, they actually played it down, and actually -- and I'm happy about this, Conan the dog, got more publicity than me, and I'm very happy about that.
I'm very -- Conan's incredible and Conan's coming to the White House in a few weeks. But it is -- you know -- did you ever see a story disappear so fast? I mean here -- if -- if Obama had that story, that thing would be going on for another seven months. They'd be talking about his bravery, oh, he's so brave, but again, 142 judges he gave us, remember that.
How can you be a great -- you know, they always say the most important thing a President can do is federal judges. We got two Supreme Courts, great works, great job, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, great judges. By the way, did you ever see any human being treated worse than now Justice Kavanaugh? Did anybody ever?
Was anybody -- was any human being by these people, these horrible, horrible people that we have to deal with? Anyway, just to finish. So, Hunter then goes to China and I'm dealing with China right now. They don't like me too much. They dream about the day when somebody else -- and would they like to have -- how about this.
You give this son, who has zero experience with investing, you give him $1.5 billion to invest, meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars, and the biggest guys on Wall Street can't get it. He walks out with $1.5 billion, and then there are other places also, I understand. Folks, it's disgraceful that the press doesn't cover it for what it is. It's a payoff.
It's a payoff. And how would you like to have sleepy Joe with the son getting all of this money from China to become President, and take over the China deal? I -- they are not like me. They had the worst year that they've had in 57 years. Their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs, and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now, billions and billions of dollars.
We're talking billions and billions of dollars. And you know what we're doing with some of it? Just a small portion but 100% they're taken care of. Our farmers got $16 billion last year and $12 billion a year before because they targeted our farmers. Because they know the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers.
So, they targeted them and they brought the $16 billion down to practically nothing and they thought our farmers would say, oh, we don't like Trump. They did just the opposite. They said we know he's doing the right thing because we've been ripped off for so many years. But I said to them, I said to Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, a great guy, I said Sonny, how much did they spend buying our corn and soybeans and all of our agricultural product?
He said sir, $16 billion. I said good I'll make it up and we're going to have a lot leftover. So, we will have pretty soon, over $100 billion in money paid into the United States Treasury by a country that never gave us $0.10, they only took, one they only took. So, when I said to the farmers we're going to send you $16 billion that's already been sent that has been split in the $12 billion the year before.
I mean think of that, $28 billion, I said compliments of China, and we had a lot leftover. Not bad, right? Not bad. Do you think Obama would do that? I don't think so. Do you think Hillary would do that? I don't think so. Do you think sleepy Joe would do that? I don't think so. He wouldn't know what you're talking about.
On Tuesday, the proud people of Mississippi will send Democrats a clear message. It's very important, for this reason, as well as, the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst. But you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption. They're corrupt -- Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician.
You know, when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that I said it. I said, oh, I'm going to sue him. They said sir, I'm sorry, you can't. He's got total immunity because he made it in Congress. Can you believe this? But you know, here's the good news. At least we have a forum, we have a place we can talk so everyone knows what's going on. A bunch of phony people.
But this is why we have to send a signal, and why you have to make Tate Reeves your great new republic -- right? Republican Governor, right? Tate, he's a great guy too. And all I know is he's loved and respected by your current Governor because Phil is some piece of work. You know Phil is so confident. I wanted Phil to run for a certain office then I wanted him to do something -- I've tried to get him, but you know, some guys are confident.
Phil said, no, sir, I've been doing this all my life. I love the people. He built the most beautiful African-American museum, Phil. He's the greatest. But he built the most beautiful-- but he's got confidence. And he said, no, sir, I've been doing it. I don't really want to do that. In other words, he said that's enough.
Most people are so insecure, they keep going and going and going. It's not good. I like Phil's attitude, but Phil is great, but I'm going to introduce Phil in a second. But Tate Reeves who Phil endorses and views as a champion for your state, and really a champion for Mississippi values. And Tate helped cut your taxes over 50 times, including the largest tax cut in Mississippi history.
Tate is pro-worker, he's pro-jobs, he's pro-family, he's pro-life. Tate is a true leader in the fight to protect the unborn, which the other side is not. Tate Reeves will support our police, oppose sanctuaries -- oh, we love our police, right? I love -- we love our police. He'll oppose sanctuary cities, which is just terrible, they're terrible, and Tate will always defend your Second Amendment.
So, Tate's running against a Liberal Democrat named Jim Hood. [Audience Boos] Now what I know about Jim Hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked Hillary Clinton and Barack-Hussein-Obama. Isn't that nice? [Audience Boos] He wanted Obama to win so badly, and then, he wanted Hillary to win, and that's not the kind of guy we need here, not in Mississippi.
He's supported by extreme lefties, like Stacey Abrams, who by the way, went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentleman from the great state of Georgia, Brian Kemp. And they came in with -- oh, they brought them all. They had President Obama, they had Michelle Obama, they had Oprah Winfrey, they came in, and all he had was Donald Trump, and we won.
We won. Fairly easily. But Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote. Do you believe this? [Audience Boos] I mean, some of these people, they want to give them education, they want to give them this, they want to give them free healthcare. They want to give these people that come into our country illegally, more advantages than our own citizens have, more advantages than our own military has.
[Audience Boos] Jim Hood wants to raise your taxes. He supports taxpayer funding for abortion providers. [Audience Boos] He supports illegal immigration and all benefits, and he opposed our travel ban, which is so important that we won in the United States Supreme Court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country.
And Jim Hood went to the United Nations and opposed your right to self-defense. If you don't want a far-left Democrat running Mississippi -- wait a minute. How's this guy, you know, I can't believe this is a competitive race. It's like embarrassing. I'm talking to Mississippi you know. I'm talking to Mississippi.
I can't believe it. I don't think that he's going to be the right guy. I think the guy that you want is Tate Reeves. He's going to be fantastic. He will be a great, great Governor. Tate, come on up, Tate.
Thank you, Mr. President. Mississippi welcomes you because Mississippi is Donald J. Trump country. We gave you almost 60% of vote in 2016 and next year we're going to do even better, and the reason is because President Trump is a strong leader. He is the right leader to defeat the radical Liberals who have taken over the Democrat Party.
Now, these radical Liberals have been trying to remove our President from office since the very day he was sworn in. [Audience Boos] They have disrespected him and that means they have disrespected us. Jim Hood does not spend -- stand with our President. He stands with the radical Liberals. When the radical Liberals tried to stop the President on border security, Jim Hood stood with the Liberals.
[Audience member calls out "Build the wall"] When the choice was Donald J. Trump, our crooked Hillary, Jim Hood, stood with Hillary Clinton. And today, with the election just days away, I'm standing with President Donald Trump and Jim -- and Jim Hood is standing with the Liberals. Now Mississippi, it is time to choose.
It is time to stand up and be counted. Are we going to stand with President Donald Trump? [Audience shouts "Yeah"] Are you going to stand with me on Tuesday? [Audience shouts "Yeah"] Let's stand up to keep America great. Let's stand up to elect a Conservative that will be an ally to President Donald J. Trump.
I need your prayers, I need your support, and most importantly on Tuesday, I need your vote. Thank you all.
Thank you, Tate. Tuesday, go out and vote for Tate. He'll never let you down and don't kid yourself, your Second Amendment is under attack, not with him. It's under attack. So, we're also joined tonight by a man who is truly -- and I sort of said it a lot, but he's been a great Governor and he loves your state.
He loves the people of this great state. Governor Phil Bryant. Where's Phil? Come up, Phil. Come on. Oh, he's central casting, look at him. Come here, Phil.
Alright, I just want to say one more thing. Is this Trump country? This has been the greatest President of my lifetime. Let me tell you why, well, what we always wanted was a fighter. We said somebody should stand up to the Democrats and fight. Well, this is what fighting looks like. Let's go Make America Great Again. [Audience chants "USA"]
Thank you, Phil. Thank you. Thank you, my Phil. What a job, what a great job. You have to continue that whole thing going forward. So, another man is a warrior. He's a friend of mine. Whenever there's a problem he's there, he's always there, he'll be right at the front. He is tough, he's smart, he's brilliant actually -- and he loves this state and he loves you, people.
Senator Roger Wicker. Roger. Thanks, Roger. Thank you, Roger. And somebody I'll call her up because believe it or not she's running with me. She just ran. I said Senator you just ran, you just won. She said no, I have to do it again. She's running in 2020. I thought she'd have like six years. I said Cindy, it's only like a year.
Cindy Hyde-Smith, she's incredible, she's tough and smart, and strong, and she's with us all the way, Cindy Hyde-Smith.
Is this guy incredible or what? We have got a President we can be proud of, and let me tell you something, this Tuesday Mississippi can send a message to the entire nation. We can let the Liberal Democrats with their socialist agenda know, it may be alive and well in the heart of Nancy Pelosi, but it is dead in Mississippi.
We can let them know we don't want open illegal borders for drug smugglers to come through them. We can let them know that to kill an unborn baby is not a human right, it is a human life. This is a great crowd tonight. Next Tuesday, let's go out and vote. Let's support our Governor Tate Reeves. Let's support these Mississippi Republican candidates.
Go out and vote and let's show the President how much we appreciate him right now.
Great job, fantastic woman, so also with us, two terrific friends of mine, that like Roger and like Cindy Hyde-Smith and like all of them, and Tate. He's going to be right there. He'll be right up there with us all fighting together. Two incredible people, Trent Kelly, Michael Guest. Incredible people. And your next Lieutenant Governor, Delbert Hosemann.
Your next Attorney General, Lynn Fitch. Your next Secretary of State, Michael Watson. Great people. Your next State Treasurer, David McRae; State Auditor, Shad White; Agriculture Commissioner, Andy Gibson; Insurance Commissioner, Mike Chaney; and former Governor, a man that nobody's ever heard of in this room, I'm sure.
But the truth is he's a legend in politics and a great guy. He's a great guy, Haley Barbour. Thank you, Haley. Great guy. So with the help of everyone here, we're the hottest economy in the world. We've created over 6.7 million new jobs since the election. If I would have said during the campaign that I would create 6.7 million new jobs since the election, these people would have gone crazy.
They would have said horrible things. They would have said it's impossible. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over 51 years, soon to be historic. African-American unemployment just dropped to the lowest rate ever recorded historic. Really an important to me, the African-American youth unemployment rate is the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country.
We lifted 55,000 Mississippi residents out of poverty, 55,000. Hourly earnings are up 9% in Mississippi since the election. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories in our country. Under my administration, we've already added nearly 10,000 new factories and many more are coming in as we speak.
To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts on average, $2000 to $2500 per family, bringing almost $1 trillion back home to our shores. What's happening, you couldn't get the money, the big companies, they couldn't get their money back, both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint. They brought back almost $1 trillion now because of us, all put to work.
We slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations, and we ended the war on American energy. We are now the number one producer of energy by far, anywhere in the world. For decades, you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals. Mississippi lost 40% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, two of the worst deals ever made by our country, 100,000 Mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that.
And that's awful and a big price to pay for Washington's disloyalty to the American worker. That's what it was. It was disloyalty, stupidity, corruption, lots of reasons. But now, you finally have a President who is loyal to you, and I am. I'm a fighter for your jobs, for your wages, your factories, your families, and your dignity.
We're stopping China from ripping us off. We're stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the United States, where we lose our money, we lose our wealth, we lose our jobs, we close our factories. That's not happening anymore, it's reversed. We were the sucker country for years and years, but we are not the sucker country anymore and they all know it. We're replacing NAFTA and that was a disaster, NAFTA.
With the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement of Nancy Pelosi will ever put it up to a vote, which is questionable. Nervous Nancy, she doesn't want to give the people of our country a victory. She's very busy doing other things, having fun. The USMCA will be a massive victory for Mississippi's farmers, and also includes, powerful protections for Mississippi auto workers, manufacturers, and everybody else.
A great agreement, about time we got rid of NAFTA. The do-nothing Democrats need to stop their madness and pass the USMCA right now. The last administration's horrendous Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the U.S auto industry, but I proudly -- first thing, withdrew from that job-killing calamity.
Under our policies, Toyota has just announced a $170 million investment in Mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility. Did you ever hear of this place? Blue Springs, Blue Springs. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world.
We take care of other people, we take care of other countries, but we don't take care of our own. They knowingly decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. They deployed our military to protect, think of this, immensely wealthy nations subsidizing their welfare states with your money.
I ask those wealthy nations now -- I respectfully, the other day said to the King of Saudi Arabia, King, we're going to help you, but you've got to pay. And he was great. No, he was great. He was great, he said, but nobody has ever asked before. I said, but I'm asking and billions of dollars will come in, and we're protecting a great ally.
We have a -- we have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country, buying military and other things. But we said, you're very wealthy you have to pay, and they're going to pay. And that's true with many countries, by the way, that's true with many countries. They never respected us. They could never believe it. I said to one country, I have great respect for the Prime Minister of Japan.
I said to Prime Minister, I said how did you get away with this for so long? And he looked at me and he couldn't really answer it because how the hell did this happen? We're protecting, like 94 countries, ask China. How many countries are you protecting, President Xi? And they look at me like, what a stupid question.
We protect one, China. If you ask President Putin, how many countries are you protecting, President Putin? And he looks and he goes, Russia. You ask other countries, we're protecting at least 94, that's so many they don't even -- they can't even tell me. I've been trying to get an answer for months. So many they can't even tell -- it's crazy, but it's all beautiful the way it's happening, a lot of good things are happening.
But these same politicians poured precious American blood and treasure into the sands of the Middle East while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay. Our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you to take your money to take your jobs, to redistribute your wealth, all over the globe, wherever they wanted it. But I don't like that.
I don't like it. The great sellout out has ended and it ended the day I took the oath of office. That was quite a [Inaudible]. After years of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation. We are finally putting America first. Our policy of never-ending war, regime change, and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of American interests.
[Audience member calls out "There you go"] It is the job of our military to protect our security, not to be the policeman of the world. Proving the wisdom of this approach, we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in Northern Syria without spilling one drop of American blood, not one drop. Actually, I have to be honest, one soldier stepped on a nail.
It's true. I said don't tell the press that because They'll say -- but one soldier stepped on a nail. I said how bad was it? It's OK. I said don't mention it, please. They always like to mention exactly what happened. You could take it a little bit low key, stepped on a nail. [Audience member calls out "Go, Donald.
Audience BoosNot not a drop of blood. And we don't have to defend the borders between Turkey and Syria. They've been fighting for a thousand years, but what we do is we did keep the oil if you don't mind. We kept the oil. We kept the oil. And we'll distribute that oil, we'll help out the Kurds, and we'll help out other people, we'll also help out ourselves if that's OK. Past leaders, foolish military adventures turned faraway nations into very, very dangerous war zones.
Then, they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions. I don't think so. I don't think so. We did not fight them over there only to invite them over here. We don't want to do that. To protect our communities, my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures, toughest ever that we've ever had.
No issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party, as that issue by the Democrats. They want open borders which means crime. They want sanctuary cities which means crime and drugs and death. After bleeding the middle-class dry, Democrats threw open our borders to the world, flooding our communities with poisonous drugs, and criminal cartels.
Republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities. We are now building a wall. [Audience chants "Build that wall"] We're building it. We're building it. And you think that was easy? The Democrats, they didn't want that wall. I got money for everything but when it came to the wall, not ten cents, not ten cents, but we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military, and we took it from here, and we took it from there, and we had to go to court.
And all of a sudden, we start winning cases. We're winning cases now, winning a lot of cases. But the wall is going up rapidly. It's going up rapidly, and this is a very serious wall. This is the exact -- everything they wanted. They went to the Border Patrol, incredible people, and ICE, incredible people, tough people, they love our country.
And I said give me the specifications for the wall. They said, well, sir, we'd like steel but we'd also like concrete and would also like rebar -- I said what do you want? Which one? So, I did all three because it's a different form of cutting. You can get through steel, but you can't through the concrete, and then, you can't through the hardened rebar.
We got it all and we also need to see through, sir. You've got to see who's on the other side. That makes sense, right? It's not just concrete. It's more expensive what we're doing, but we're giving and we're building -- we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year.
It's going in all the right areas, in all the right areas. That was a tough one, and the Army Corps of Engineers is building their hearts out. They're great. They're great people. We believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country. And thanks to our tireless efforts on the Southern border, tough place.
Illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May and we are faster than ever securing the Southern border, and soon, it will be when the wall is completed, secure, like it's never been before. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders; 27,000; do you know that is? And they are keeping people out -- and I want to thank the President of Mexico.
He's an excellent person, great man, and we appreciate it, and the reason is that our Democrats won't even approve things called loopholes. They're loopholes. That's a horrible name, right? That means it's a loophole. That means you can come in illegally and lots of things, catch and release. You catch him then you got to release them.
By law, you've got to release them. They'll arrest the Border Patrol agent if they -- it's crazy, but we could end this in 15 minutes. But they don't want to do it. They don't want to do it. Their obstructionists, they're colluders, and we can't let it happen. That's why you have to go with Tate Reeves. You know, Tate's going to send -- Tate's going to send a big signal, by the way.
It's great for you. He's going to be a great Governor. It also sends a big signal to these radical left crazy Democrats. It's very important that Tate wins, very important. We're also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like Mississippi, which has banned sanctuary cities because Phil Bryant said we're not going to have them and Roger Wicker said we're not going to have them, and Cindy said we're not going to have them.
Democrat sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. If you want a Governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE, and they are heroes, I wouldn't want their job. MS-13, they walk right into those nest, they call them a nest. And they start swinging -- you've never seen anything like it. I'll say, you know what, better you than me. Let's see, who would do good?
He'd do good, that guy, that guy would do that. Mostly you wouldn't do good. No, I mean, these guys are tough guys and they love our country. Who would do it? They're moving thousands of people from MS-13. These gangs are the worst people. These people -- these are not human beings. You know, I said that once before, and this crazy Nancy Pelosi said how dare you say, they're not human.
Have you ever see these people? And they slice people up with a knife because it's more painful than using a gun. And then, I have to defend myself when I say they're animals. But you know what, I never changed. I didn't say, oh, I'd like to apologize. I'd like to apologize crazy Nancy. And you got to look at her district in San Francisco.
She's spending all her time on this crap, all this impeachment stuff. Take a look at what's happening to the great city, once, of San Francisco. It's thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles, and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods. Nancy Pelosi, go home and fix your district, Nancy.
Go home and fix your district. Go home and fix your district. If you want a Governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol, vote for Tate Reeves, Tuesday, got to get out. You've got to get out. You've got to send the signal. Let it be a big victory too. The Democrat Party has never been more extreme, you know that than it is today.
The Democrats' healthcare agenda would obliterate Medicare. I will always protect Medicare for our seniors, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. We will always take care of them. Virtually every Democrat, also now supports, late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth.
[Audience Boos] Well, the Governor of Virginia executed a baby, remember that whole thing? After birth, after birth, some people never heard of it. He said the baby is born, and then, he starts talking to the mother. Nobody ever heard that. That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream. Nobody has done more for the African-American community than the Republican Party, and we're also the Party of Abraham Lincoln.
We can't forget that, people forget. Abraham Lincoln, honest Abe. To lift up distressed communities, we created opportunity zones. So incredible, so successful, including 100 new opportunity zones right now in Mississippi, where money is now flowing in to build and to fix, and Tim Scott. I give him so much credit from the great state of South Carolina.
We passed VA choice and VA accountability on behalf of our great veterans. People said it couldn't be done, VA choice. Our veterans were waiting in line for days and weeks sometimes. Now, they can go out choice, they can go out, get a doctor, we pay the bill, and they don't have to wait six weeks, four weeks, two weeks.
We have people waiting in line, they weren't very sick, by the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill. Now, they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans. The great rebuilding of the American Armed Forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in Biloxi and Gulfport and Jackson and Starkville and Roger has been fantastic and Cindy Hyde-Smith has been fantastic.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It's not the same country anymore. Nothing's easy but it's not the same, and I recognize Israel's true capital and open the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years you watched as your politicians apologize for America.
Now, you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Mississippi. The next step to victory begins on Tuesday, right here in your great state. With your support, we will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not ever going to back down from, perhaps the greatest victory in political history, and you know today with the new stock market at an all-time high.
It's -- I will tell you something if we didn't win this election, that stock market would be in one half. It was heading in the wrong direction and it was going to fail. And if they ever did anything bad, if they ever do anything bad to us, if they ever succeed in their wildest dream, which will never let them happen.
That stock market will crash like you've never seen a crash before, and you will not be happy with your 401(k)s like you're happy right now, because they don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing. And I'd like to speak well, but the leadership they have no clue. They're just very vicious people, actually, they're sort of mentally violent people, but we've got it under control.
It always helps when you didn't do anything wrong. I always say, how do you impeach a President who didn't do anything wrong? So, we're going to send a signal by sending a terrific new Republican Governor to Jackson. On Tuesday, you're going to get out and you're going to vote and you're going to give up whatever you have to give up. You're going to leave work maybe a little earlier or maybe get there a little late.
Tell your boss I said it was OK. I will give you a pardon if I have to. I'll give you one hour pardon. But with your help, we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration, and you have great Congressmen here.
And I'll tell you what, I appreciate it. You're warriors, you're warriors, you are warriors. What was it 196 for and nothing against, right? That doesn't happen with Republicans. It doesn't happen. I always complain. I would say the Democrats are lousy politicians. They have lousy policies, open borders, sanctuary cities, but they have one thing, they stick together and they're vicious.
The Republicans have great policy, in many ways, they're better politicians but they're not as vicious. Thank you, darling. I appreciate it. They're not as vicious but they have a tendency to split apart. The Democrats don't seem to have any Mitt Romney's, we do, we do. I don't know. Maybe he'll get better, maybe he'll get better.
We'll see. We'll see what happens. Maybe I'll get better. Just let it be fair, but they don't have that. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words made in the USA, made in America. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine.
Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Can you believe that? Within 10 years it will be over. When they told me that I said that's incredible. We're going to end the AIDS epidemic within 10 years. It's funded. Nobody else thought we could do that but we're doing it. We'll have it ended in America in 10 years, the AIDS epidemic, who would've thought.
We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement.
We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto and we always will, you'll never see it disappear, In God we Trust.
We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who cross the oceans, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, pioneered technology, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single-greatest nation in the history of the world, and today, it's greater than ever before.
Proud citizens, like you, helped build this country, and together, we are taking back our country. That's what we're doing, that's what happened in 2016. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, we get so tired of winning.
I don't know Mississippi. You know you're winning. You had the best year you've ever had. You know you have the best Mississippi, the best year you've ever had in the history of our country. Mississippi, your statistic, and Mississippi, aren't you getting tired of winning? [Audience shouts "No"] I guess not.
So, Phil doesn't come to me and say, sir, please, we're winning too much. The people of Mississippi can't take it anymore. I don't think you'll ever have to make that trip. I don't think he's ever going to have to, and I don't think Tate will ever have to make that trip. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Mississippi, the best is yet to come. Because together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will Make America Great Again. Thank you, Mississippi. Thank you.
[This is a First Draft of the transcript and has not yet been proofread by humans] Thank you very much. Hello, Michigan. Hello, Michigan. I love this state and I love the people of this state, and thank you for being here. Thank you. Thank you. You know you may have heard, I was invited to another event tonight, The White House Correspondents Dinner [Booing], but I'd much rather be in Washington, Michigan than in Washington DC right now, that I could tell you.
Great people. Thank you for that incredible support and by the way you want to see a lot of people go outside. We could have filled this place up, probably five or six times, you see what's going on. Thank you. This is a beautiful building, but I said: couldn't you have gotten one larger? That would be nice right, but you know the expression you're inside, so you made it good, realistic. Good job tonight.
We're especially honored to be joined by your really great friend of mine and a great Attorney General, the next governor of Michigan Bill Schuette, where's Bill? Well all right Bill, wherever the hell he is, right? Bill Schuette. We also welcome members of Congress, Paul Mitchell, Jack Burkman and John Mullen are... Where are they? Thank you fellas. These are great people, and I want to thank Chris McAnally and the Total Sports Park team for hosting us tonight.
Thank you. I wish you could have given us a larger arena, but what are you gonna do right? Thank you, fellas. Finally, we have to thank a very special person in all of our lives because he got Melania. This, that's true because our amazing chairwoman, the Republican National Committee Ronna McDaniel, she's done some job and if you remember, she ran the state of Michigan and who won the state of Michigan after decades.
I remember that night. You know, but a long time since the Republicans won Michigan and they said Donald Trump has won this state of Michigan remember and we won a lot of other states also. That was some night. So I want to thank Rana for the great job that she really has done.
She's done it right from the literally right from the beginning. In fact, what we needed somebody over at the RNC, I said get that woman that ran Michigan. We need to elect more Republicans, so we can protect our cities, defend our borders, grow our economy and continue to make America great again and that's what we're doing we're doing we're doing some job we're all doing it together, but you see what's happening with regulations with Massive tax cuts with the judges we're pointing we're. Appointing judges like I guess never before has anything happened like what we're doing on great conservative Republican judges we're setting records and by the time we finish, I think we will have the all-time record.
You have no idea how important it and then, of course, we have Justice Gorsuch who's been fantastic, he has been fantastic. Everyone here tonight is united by the same timeless American values. We defend our Constitution, we support the rule of law and we support the heroes of law enforcement.
We are pride in our history and respect for our great American flag. We defend our flag and we honor our flag and if others honored our flag, there'd be a lot better off. Wouldn't they wouldn't it. We put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and we do that proudly and we stand for the national anthem.
We believe that a strong nation must have strong borders. Are you watching that mess that's going on right now with the caravan coming up? Are you watching this and our laws are so weak, they're, so pathetic, given to us by Democrats, they're so pathetic, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and let me tell you, we've gotten Mexico to work with us on stopping a lot of what's pouring in, but we have the Worst laws anywhere in the world, we don't have borders, we're gonna build the wall, we're getting it. We've already started. I don't know if you see you know it's funny, so San Diego they're being just overrun great place, but they're being overrun by people pouring so they're begging us for a wall.
So we have the money, it's all funded in San Diego and those people really want it, and I said, let's not do it there. Let's let them put pressure on Governor Jerry Brown, Moonbeam, Moonbeam, so we started the wall and it's being built in San Diego beautiful job. They did a great job and they said you know we stopped that war. All the people in San Diego are gonna put a lot of pressure, and I said well, let's see about that.
So I said: how much would it cost to stop the wall, sir, it will cost seven million in extras. I can't pay the extra, as I hate extras right, so we're building the wall, but San Diego San Diego, wants the wall. That's going up and honestly seriously, they would have put a lot of pressure in California. If you look at what's going on with sanctuary cities.
Now, all over California, especially California, the home of sanctuary cities, the home of sanctuary cities. But do you see what's going on where areas big areas? They don't want sanctuary cities, they want to be safe, they don't want them. So we've started. We have $1.6 billion and this last budget just so you understand we had to fund our military folks, we got, we got seven, our military was depleted and it was in trouble and now we're honoring brand new airplanes, world and brand new everything we got. Seven hundred billion dollars approved and next year we got seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars approved for our military.
We had to do it and General Mad Dog Mattis would not be happy. I said to him yesterday I said General: do you think we really needed this? Much we needed it, sir. We need it, we really did. We needed it. So, by doing that, the Democrats don't care about our military, they don't they don't care and they don't care about our borders and I don't think they care much about crime, because if you look at it MS-13 they pour through everybody pours through and they wanted.
They wanted and by the way we are getting rid of MS-13 in record numbers, okay record, the liberal politicians who support criminal aliens and they support them over far over American citizens. Nancy Pelosi and her gang they've got to be voted out of office. They've got to be voted out of office and you have a senator in mission. Senator Debbie Stabenow [Applause]. She voted against Kate's Law. She voted against tax cuts, she votes against borders, she wants people to flow into the country and you people just keep putting her back again and again and again, it's your fault, so you got to get to the pole and we have some great people running the Primer is going to be over with soon, but we have some great people and honestly, if you want the borders to be secure, if you want to keep those big tack, how have you done with the tax cuts by the way and not only the tax cuts? The jobs that have been created, the jobs, unemployment, let me tell you our country - is doing great.
You know the stock market, which is not really the all-time indicator, because the country is actually doing much better than the stock market, but the stock market is up almost 35 percent since the election, but the country's doing actually even bother. You know what bothers the stockmarket. I would have been up 60%, but I have to do things. You know what I have to do. I can't let other countries take advantage of us. Okay, I can't so we're doing trade deals and a lot of these folks in Washington.
Please don't do that. I said: wait a minute: we have a horrible deal on this one on that one I won't even mention. I love you too [Applause], so we have to renegotiate these deals. If you look at China last year with China and look he's been of great help, President Xi he's a friend of mine, but he likes China.
I, like the USA, but he's a friend of mine, but you know what he's been a great help on the border with North Korea and a lot of good things are happening war, a lot of good thing, I'm not gonna give you what's going to actually Happen: cuz, we don't really know, but I'll tell you one thing: we're not playing games, and I remember you know it was very rough three, four months ago. That's very nice! Thank you. That's where Nobel I just want to get the job done. So if we would have, if we would have said where we are today from three or four months ago, remember they were saying he's going to get us into nuclear war. They said no, no, no, no strength is going to keep us out of nuclear war, not gonna get us right, so we're doing very well.
I spoke to the president this morning of South Korea for a long time. They just had a very good meeting. He gives us tremendous credit. He gives us all the credit I mean he as president moon of South Korea.
You know it started with the Olympics because, frankly, the Olympics was not going to have a lot of people and all of a sudden North Korea called in and said you know, we'd love to participate in the Olympics. Everyone said, excuse me, that's it, but that was a good thing. It was a great thing and they went from having a real potential disaster. You know they worked on it for 15 years to make it great and they did a great job. South Korea did a great job, but they didn't have people who's gonna go all of a sudden.
They had a tremendous Olympics very, very successful and we are doing things that are good. I think we'll have a meeting over the next three or four weeks. They're going to be a very important meeting, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula of North Korea and but we'll see how it goes and again, whatever happens happens, look I'm going. It may not work out. I leave I'm not going to be a John Kerry who makes that horrible Aranda horrible one of the worst deals.
I mean, how do you make a deal like that? A hundred and fifty billion dollars 1.8 billion dollars in cash? You know what that is, and you know what they got. They got nothing. They got nothing so we're gonna have hopefully a very successful negotiation over the next three or four weeks and we'll be doing the world a big favor, we'll be doing the world. A big favor, let's see how it goes, I think we'll do fine, I think we're gonna do just I had one of the fake news groups this morning, [Applause]. Now they were saying what do you think President Trump had to do with it? I'll tell you what like, how about everything, [, Applause,] and even president moon, says that and he's been great and I'll. Tell you why it's gonna be an interesting period of time.
We had a very interesting thing happen. Over the last few days, senator Jon Tester of a really great place, Montana, who voted by the way in favor of sanctuary cities, who's weakened the border didn't vote for tax cuts. He took a gentleman who is a truly high-quality human being and what they said about him. What they said about this great American doctor, Ronny Jackson, an admiral in the Navy.
He served three presidents. President Obama said he was fantastic. President Bush said he was fantastic. I say he's fed this is a high quality individual like they would love in Montana and tester started, throwing out things that he's heard well, I know things about tester that I could say to and if I said him, he'd never be elected again and it was Said because I watched dr. Jackson, Admiral Admiral Jeff, both a doctor and an admiral high-quality, but I watched him and I suggested it because we're taking care of our vets.
You know we've done a great job with our vets. We have accountability, approach, we're getting choice approved and I pulled it because I didn't like the choice. The choice wasn't good enough what they were going to. I could had it already.
We could have had it in the last budget, but it wasn't good enough we're getting choice, which is a big deal. That's going to be game-changing and by the way I have five great people that want to run the VA. We have great people but I'll tell you what Jon Tester did this man is a disgrace. Admiral Jackson started setting and he was working so hard.
I suggested it to him. You know he war hero a leader. A great you know, he's a Admiral, a great great guy, 50 years old and he started studying, and then he started getting hit with vicious rumors vicious and the Secret Service told me just coming. In sir, we checked out all of those things, sir they're, not true.
They're not true, so they try and destroy a man. Well, they're doing it with us they're trying their damnedest, but that but a little. I want to thank by the way the House Intelligence Committee. Okay, they do it with us to Russian collusion.
You know I guarantee you I'm tougher on Russia. Nobody ever thought in fact. Do you have you heard about the lawyer for a year a woman lawyer? She was like, oh, I know nothing. No, no! Now, all of a sudden, she supposedly is involved with government.
You know why, if she did that, because Putin and the group said you know this Trump is killing us. Why don't you say that you're involved with government so that we can go and make their life in the United States even more chaotic? Look at what's happened? Look at how these politicians have fallen for this junk Russian collusion. Give me a break I'll. Tell you the only collusion.
Is the Democrats colluded with the Russians and the Democrats colluded with lots of other people, take a look at the intelligence agencies and what about hate and what about combing? You watch them on. The interviews are what about Gumbel? What about Comey? How about that so combing? How about this guy coming? He said the other night, the fake dirty dossier. He said the other night on Fox. He said very strongly.
No, I didn't know that it was paid for by the Democrats and Hillary Clinton how about that. They start something based on a document that was paid for by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. Honestly, folks, let me tell you, let me tell you it's a disgrace. We got to get back down to business, it's a disgrace what's going on in our country, and they did that they did that to admiral jackson.
They are doing it to a lot of people. Innuendo. You know in the old days when the newspapers used to write they put names down today they say sources have said that President Trump sources they never say who the sources they don't have sources. The sources don't exist.
In many cases they don't have sources and the sources in many cases don't exist. These are very dishonest people, many of them they are very, very dishonest people, fake dues buried this on [Music]. But you watch go me and you watch the way he lies and then he's got the memos. I wonder when he wrote the memos right, then he's got the memos and he puts them up watch the way he lies.
It's the most incredible thing. Do you remember? Jon Lovitz, do you remember the liar? Well, Combes, worse commies, a liar and a leaker, you know, but you know I did you a great favor when I fired this guy. I tell you, I did you a great favor, because when you look at what was going on at the top of the FBI, it is a disgrace that everybody in this room understands it. The lovers, the two lovers right: Lisa Lisa and struck Lisa and Peter the two lovers: what they said.
What was going on look at how many of those top officials were fired or removed, and they should be out of here, and what about the guy that took $ 700,000 for his wife's campaign? Nobody even talks about it. Nobody even talks about it. I'll tell you what I've been talking about it for a long time and if our Justice Department was doing the right thing, they'd be a lot tougher right now on those people, because there's tremendous crime and corruption. On the other side we need to drain the swamp.
We need to vote against guys like John tester, that can destroy a man with innuendo and we have to be very careful with the press because they do the same. Damn thing we love our country. We believe our citizens deserve a government that is loyal to them. In return for too long, the loyalty of Michigan workers was repaid with pure and simple betrayal.
You were betrayed for decades. You were dealt one devastating blow after another disastrous trade deals which I'm straightening out and I'm not saying hey. There may be a little pain for a little while, but ultimately for my farmers, I love my farmers. They're great Patriots.
Don't forget, the farmers have been doing lousy for 15 years. Ok, let's face it. If you look at a graph, it's been like this. So when I say I'm negotiating NAFTA and if they don't make a fair deal, I'm terminating Neffs that I'll make a great deal.
You're gonna do much better or when we take on China or the European Union, which has tremendous blocks. It's very hard for us to sell stuff into the European Union. It was put there to take advantage of the United States okay. So when we do not anymore you're right, not anymore, we told them that yesterday actually said the same words not anymore.
Those days are over, but we've got to open up these markets. It's not fair, don't forget with China and President Xi when he was at mar-a-lago six months ago. I said to him: would you do me a favor? Would you take our cattle because you remember in 2000 they ended, they wouldn't take our cattle for whatever reason, but they didn't take cattle after a short discussion. He said I will sow the cattle is now going to China, but and plenty of other things, and he said last week at a speech.
He is going to start opening up China, but it's not enough. It's not enough when we lose 500 billion dollars a year and that's in a trade deficit. When we lose hundreds of billions of dollars in intellectual property theft, not only China but others, we have to stop it. We can't allow this to happen so in a certain way, I call people Patriots because it's short term, you may have to take some problems.
Long term you're gonna be so happy, you're gonna be so happy we're gonna get it opened up or we're not doing business with these other countries right with with the European Union last year. You know it sounds so nice, the European Union. You know why I mean they literally did like I said they formed to take advantage of the United States and I don't blame them. You know what I don't blame them.
I don't blame President Xi, I don't blame Prime Minister Abbey of Japan. I don't blame the heads of these countries for taking advantage of us. I blame past presidents and past leaders of our country. I was in China and I was making a speech and I was saying how bad it is, how unfairly we're treated and I'm in front of thousands of people from China, and I could see the mood was getting dark and I have President Xi over here and I realized I was going point after point, how bad it is for us how good it is for them.
They became a major power since the World Trade Organization, which is a horror show for us horrible, and I looked and I looked at President Xi and he's the boss he's the guy. I said, but it's not your fault, it's not your fault. It's the fault of the representatives of the United States, who allowed you to get away with it. I don't blame you right, I don't blame you and it went out and that's the way I feel about.
I told Abby the other day, Prime Minister great guy. They send us millions of cars, we send them wheat and they don't take it. The reason wanted. We send them cattle, you know what they do, that you're just 50% 50% when we send them cattle, 35% or in farm products, but they don't take.
Many because their farmers don't want it so they're not taking your product, but when they send their cars over, we charge them almost nothing. Let me give you a great example: it's so simple China, so when they send a car into the United States of which they send many, including parts and you people know something about the car industry, because I'm bringing it back to the state of Michigan right. So so I'm bringing it back and you know with Chrysler's, moving back to Michigan from Mexico, we saw that some of you are beneficiaries of that one, thousands of jobs. We have many many car companies, you see. What's going on Toyota, many companies are opening up in Michigan, the cars are coming back to Michigan, two plants are coming back, they're being expanded, and by the way do you remember about six years ago I wasn't even running and they gave me an award.
The Republican of the year - I guess they probably maybe they knew what was gonna happen. I don't know I wasn't running long time ago and I made a speech in Michigan thanking them for the award saying how horrible? How did you let this happen where all of these plants closed move to Mexico? They build the cars in Mexico, they sell them across the border, no tax, we lose the jobs, we lose the taxes, we lose everything. How did anybody let this happening? Guess what not happening anymore? Folks - it's not happening so now, they're moving back now, they're moving back. But let me give you an example.
So China, great people by the way, great people, great country, great leader, but when they sell a car into the United States, they pay two-and-a-half percent tax. When we sell a car into China number one, they don't want it because they have barriers, so they won't take it. But if they took it it's a 25 percent tax, okay, so think of it so think of it. So they have a tax. That's ten times higher.
Now what they say is we don't want your cars, we have a barrier, but if we take them it's twenty five percent, so we're two-and-a-half twenty five. So far it doesn't sound good, but what's really bad is they say we won't take your cars. We want you to build your factories in China and make the cars there. Okay, all right, but you know what.
Why are they wrong because now we're doing that? Also? Okay, build your factories here. If you want to sell cars in the United States, let them build them in Michigan, right, Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania. You see what's happening, you see, what's happened, we're really coming back and by the way ahead of schedule. You know I've. Only been here for 15 months, we have a lot of things happening.
There has been - and I don't say this - hopefully in a braggadocious - I say this a fact: there has been even some of these people back. There agree with this one, although they try like hell, wait they try, but nobody in the first year of office has done what we've done is not me. It's we we, the first year regulations tax, cuts, judges, you look at what we've done nobody's done, what we've done, and in fact you know, Justin coming over your great congressmen are in the back of the car. Do you know what the Soo Locks are sue locks? Well, the Soo Locks are going to hell.
You know that right and we're going to get them fixed up, we're gonna get them and for the farmers. Okay, it's gonna get good and we're gonna. Let your guest workers come in because we're gonna have strong borders, but we have to have your workers come in. You know the unemployment picture is so good.
It's so strong that we have to let people come in they're gonna be guesswork, is they're gonna come in they're gonna work on your farms. We're gonna have the h2 bees come in. We're gonna have a lot of things happening, but then they have to go out. Then they have to go out, but we'll get a lot of men because you need them.
You need them in Wisconsin. I was very instrumental in getting Foxconn to come here. Friend of mine, great guy fantastic, they make a lot of the Apple iPhones and a lot of they make almost all of it. I mean they are an incredible, really: an incredible company, they're, building a fantastic plant and it's under construction now and they're going out and they're recruiting and they're getting people and they're doing it professionally.
But we need people to be able to come into our country. Do your jobs help you on the farms and then they go out. They get a leaf guest workers. We're gonna take care of that guess, workers! Don't we agree, we have to have them.
We have to have it after years of rebuilding other countries, we're finally going to rebuild our country. Okay, it's about time, [Applause,], think of it think of it. I've been saying it, but the number goes up and up and up remember this: we have spent seven trillion with the teeth trillion dollars in the Middle East. You know we have for it nothing, nothing! Nothing.
Now we've really wiped out Isis there's no military like we have, and now I've asked some of the richest countries in the world. Sorry folks, you got to pay for this. You know we're tired. We don't want to pay and we'll work with them and we'll stop the trip to the Mediterranean for the enemies.
We'll do lots of things, but we got to come home we're gonna. Let people there we're gonna. Have those people pay they got to pay. They get so much money, they don't know what to do with it: they're rolling in money and nobody, I've been asking them by the way I've been asking.
Give you a little story. I gave it the other day, but nobody reports it. So you know, I said we're going to move the embassy to Jerusalem right so a month ago they come into my office with an order, sir. I have an order.
What's the order, sir, we're going to build the embassy, raise it we're in Jerusalem, sir? Okay, good? How much sir 1 billion dollars? I said, whoa whoa and I you know I had the thing half sign. You got to see this. It's signed Donald and then it stopped, and then I put a big X over the Donald 1 billion dollar. Sir, I said: wait.
A minute we're gonna spend a billion dollars, building a essentially a one-story building. We're gonna spend a billion. So I called my guy the ambassador to Israel, his name David Friedman. You know him. He was one of the biggest smartest lawyers a deal lawyer.
One of the biggest in New York represented me over the years, he's just an incredible lawyer and he loves Israel. He loves our country, but he does. He loves. History is very proud of Israel very important to him, and I said you know David.
Let's see if you can make peace, but part of it is let's see about this, so I call my say David, I'm not spending a billion dollars on an embassy. No, so you don't have to. I said: what do you mean? I think I can do it for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars so what I said a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, he said yeah, we have a great site, they were gonna buy a site, we have a great site, the best site. It's got a building on it and I can take a corner of that building and I can spend a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, sir, and I can build a beautiful embassy and we can have it open, sir, in three months, big difference and we're gonna. Let your guest workers commend these.
Can we get it open immediately and it's opening it? Have it open, sir? In three months, big difference, big difference, so we went from a billion dollars to one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and I took the liberty of saying David. If you spend a little more than 150 thousand, that's okay, so we save a bit now it's temporary and it's set, but it's fine, it's nice and we get it open at a billion. Most of us accept all of these really beautiful young ones. Up here we won't even be around to see here we get it open immediately and it's opening in, like a month, you've been reading about it, so the embassy, but but it's not that look it's opening in a month now in, as you know, in the UK, In London we had the best site in all of London, the best site.
While some genius said, We are going to sell the site and then we are going to take the money and build a new embassy. That sounds good, right? But you have to have money left over if you do that.
So, they sold the site for like, I think -- and I'll check the numbers because they'll say, oh, you misrepresented, but these numbers are close enough. They sold the site for like $250 million. They think they are geniuses. They go out and buy a horrible location and they build a new embassy. That's the good news. The bad news, the embassy cost over a billion dollars.
So, now what do we have? We have an embassy in a lousy location and I was supposed to cut the ribbon. I didn't do the deal. It was started by Bush and Obama. It was a Bush-Obama special, okay, but it could have been stopped by Obama. It would have been stopped by me. So, they have -- listen, they have -- so I said, What kind of a deal is that? You sold this great site. It's the best site in London. Literally, the best site.
They were so happy, they got $250 million, oh, whatever, but they spent all of that money plus a lot more to build a new embassy in a lousy location. So, I don't know, folks, we need a whole new thinking here. We need a whole new thinking. We need a whole new thinking. We are going to finally put America first, okay?
Since the election, we've created more than three million jobs including 300,000 new jobs in manufacturing. We love manufacturing. By the way, they wanted me to cut the ribbon on the new embassy, and I was all set, and then in the end, I said, I'm not going. I don't want to cut. I said I'm not cutting that ribbon. I said I'm not going.
All right, hey, hopefully we'll have many years of success with that embassy, okay. In our country, jobs are booming and confidence is soaring. We are at the top of the charts, and they are talking about us all over the world. They are talking about this incredible success.
And believe me, if I didn't get elected, if the opposition party, which I call the obstructionist party, they're obstructionists, it's all they are good at. If they got elected, they wouldn't have cut regulations. They wouldn't have cut taxes. You would have been down to a GDP that would have been negative. You would have had a negative GDP, and wait until you see over the coming quarters how good it is going to be.
And you see what's happening. Our companies are ready to soar. They're ready to soar. Wages for the first time are rising at the fastest pace in many, many years -- 18, 19, 20 years. And I tell you, I always would go around and I'd say to you strongly, people have jobs. They made more money 21 years ago than they make today and in some cases, they have two and three jobs. Terrible.
African-American unemployment has reached the lowest level in history -- in history. Hispanic unemployment -- any Hispanics in the room? Hispanics? No, not so many, that's okay.
And by the way, in all fairness, Kanye West gets it. He got it. He gets it, and he saw that. When he sees that African-American unemployment is the lowest in history, you know, people are watching. That's a very important thing he has done for his legacy, it's a very important thing.
But Hispanic unemployment, lowest level in history -- women female unemployment, lowest level in 18 years. And wages are going up for the first time in many, many years. That's great. As a result of our massive tax cuts, which by the way, Debbie Stabenow voted against and if they get in, if the Democrats get in, they are going to take the tax cuts away and they're going to raise your taxes to a much higher level than you ever thought possible. That's what they want to do, so they can give the money away.
Millions of Americans are receiving large bonuses and bigger paychecks than they've ever received because they have so much money that they didn't even know they were making. You see what's happened as of February 1st, and right after the cuts, the corporations gave massive bonuses and they continue. Here in Michigan, Chrysler handed out $2,000.00 bonuses to 60,000 workers and announced plans for a $1 billion investment in Warren creating a minimum of 2,500 jobs.
They are now leaving other countries and they are coming back to Michigan. Remember, I told you that five or six years ago? They are now coming back, and they are going to come back a lot faster than you have seen. And you know what's even more important than that? Leaving? Because we don't give them the incentive to leave anymore. They used to give them incentives to leave. We are not giving them incentive. No, we're giving them incentive to stay and to pay our people.
But to protect our families, we must secure our borders. The good thing about the caravan, people are watching. People are watching. You watch how horrible -- they are coming in from Honduras. They are coming in from other places. They're taking this long trek up Mexico. We want Mexico to help us and we have to demand it, but Mexico is going to help us, but there are still hundreds of people that are maybe 2,000, there's still hundreds of people, and our laws are so corrupt and stupid, I call them the dumbest immigration laws anywhere on earth.
If a person puts their foot over the line, we have to take them into our country. We have to register them. We then have to ask them a couple of questions. Lawyers are telling them what to say -- how unsafe they are, and once they say that, we have to let them go to come back to court in like a year. Only one problem, they don't come back, okay, that's the end.
Welcome to the United States. This is the law, and we have at the border the greatest people, the Border Patrol, the ICE agents. These are great people. These are great people. And the laws are so corrupt -- they are so corrupt. And you know, one of the reasons they do it is because the Democrats actually feel and they are probably right, that all of these people that are pouring across are going to vote for Democrats, they're not going to vote for Republicans, they're going to vote no matter what we do, they're going to vote...
So, there is a theory that they do it for that. They do it for a lot of reasons. A lot of times, they don't even know what they are doing. They don't even know why they are doing it, but we have to have borders and we have to have them fast, and we need security, we need the wall. We are going to have it all.
And again, that wall has started. We are $1.6 billion. We come up again on September 28th, and if we don't get border security, we have no choice, we'll close down the country because we need border security.
So, we don't have a wall, but a big portion is being built, a lot of it is being fixed. We have a wall that wasn't a wall. We have a wall with big holes in it, that's old and a lot of it is being fixed right now and we're putting up brand new gorgeous stuff, we're building new -- as I told you in San Diego and other places, but we want to now do the big job, so we are going to see what happens, but we have to have border security.
The one good thing. Watch the caravan. Watch how sad and terrible it is, including for those people because they come up, and the crime that they inflict on themselves and that others inflict on them, it's a horrible, dangerous journey for them -- for them. And they come up because they know once they get here, they can walk right into our country. We have the greatest people on earth and they can't do anything because the laws are corrupt. The laws are corrupt.
So we have fought to secure our border, but Democrats in Congress -- Nancy Pelosi, Schumer -- they've opposed us at every stop and every step. They've opposed every effort to close the loopholes to keep the violent criminals like MS-13 the hell out of our country and to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs which are pouring into our country.
And we have done a great job and the numbers are great, but you know, part of the problem is, people are smart and they see how ridiculous these laws are. They know if they can get anywhere near, once they touch our ground it's called Welcome to the United States. How crazy is it? How crazy are we to allow these?
So, I will tell you, the Republicans are working hard and Debbie Stabenow is one of the leaders for weak borders and letting people in, so I don't know how she gets elected. A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple. It's also a vote for much higher taxes. It's also a vote for be careful of your Second Amendment, okay, be careful.
Be careful of your Second Amendment if they get in. The open border policies of the Democratic Party are not just wrong, they are dangerous and they are in fact deadly. They are deadly. They make no sense. They are deadly. Their policies let gangs -- some of the most of vicious gangs in the world pour into our country. They pour into our country.
Do you know on Long Island, you have gang members that are so tough that we send in these incredible ICE agents, but you know what? The ICE agents are much tougher and they are grabbing them, and I'll tell you why. A doctor please, doctor? A doctor, please, yes take your time, take your time, darling. [A person receives medical attention in the audience]
Those are the people we love. Those are great people, I tell you. And the doctors. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Great job. Amazing. What people we have? What people we have? So we have to keep going the way we are going. You know what? We did what was they called a miracle. I don't think it was a miracle.
Do you remember on Election Day, because it was really the day before, but it was 12:00 in the evening. When I started speaking, Grand Rapid, he says, Grand Rapid, I said -- and it was an unexpected stop, but I heard the opponent was going out with the President and they were going out also unexpected, and they had a very small crowd, but when I heard that, we left where we were, we said, Let's go to Michigan, right? Grand Rapids.
I got there at 12:00 in the evening, remember that? And I said, How's the crowd? We couldn't even get near the arena. There were 32,000 people. I finished speaking at 1:00 in the morning on Election Day, remember that? You were there.
Thirty-two thousand people, now Michigan hadn't been won in many, many years. And I said, Wait a minute. We had 32,000 people. I got home at 3:00 in the morning. And I said Tell me? Why are we going to lose Michigan? Why? We had 32,000 people, 1:00 in the morning and even beyond, nobody left. Everybody was -- we had a great time, right?
And I said, So, why are we going to lose Michigan? They said because the Republicans lose Michigan. I said, Wait a minute. Wait a minute, I'm bringing the cars back. I'm bringing the plants back. I'm bringing the jobs back. We are going to win Michigan. And we won Michigan, and I think quite easily. All right. Remember that?
I always said, I made that speech. That was my last speech. I made that speech on Election Day because by the time we finished, it was 1:00. It was Election Day.
This November, every American will face a choice. Now, they say if the House doesn't make it -- it's very important -- you have great Congressmen. These are great people. These are great, great people, and thank you.
But we have to keep the House because if you listen to Maxine Waters -- she goes around saying, We will impeach him. We will impeach him. Then people said, But he hasn't done anything wrong. Oh, that doesn't matter, we will impeach the President.
So, I don't think we are going to have a lot of happy people if that happens. I think it is going to be a little bit tough, but she goes around and some others. We will impeach him. It doesn't matter if you do anything right or wrong. They want to do that.
We have got to win the House. And you know what? We are going to win anyway. But we are going to win the House. We are going to win the House.
Now, historically when you win the Presidency, the person that wins, the party that wins does poorly in what they call the midterms, and the reason is, I guess you take it easy a little bit, right? Something happens. I guess, it's 93 percent to 94 percent of the time. This is over a long period of time. I don't know why -- you know what it is? You get complacent.
We cannot be complacent. We have got to go out, right? We have got to go out -- we've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and we've got to win the Senate, and I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we're going to do great in the House because the economy is so good. The economy is so good.
And because if you look at us all, around the world, we are respected again. We are not pushovers anymore. We are not pushovers. You saw the President of France he came in, great guy. Chancellor Merkel came in yesterday from Germany. No, it will all be fine.
Look, again, don't blame them. Blame the people that used to stay here with much smaller crowds. But that's okay. Blame your American President and your American representatives. But it's not happening anymore. We are respected again as a nation. We are respected. We are not the patsies anymore. We are not the pushovers anymore.
By the way, speaking of not being a patsy or a pushover, do you ever watch Corey Lewandowski on the shows? Where is Corey? Corey? And David Bossie?
He also had very little experience. He only ran one campaign and he won, so he's one for one. Corey, say a few words.
This is Trump country. We love you, Michigan. Thank you for supporting Donald J. Trump as your next President of the United States. Thank you very much.
Thank you, fellas. I saw them back there. They work hard and these are great people and we appreciate it. We really do. Okay, ready? So, we need more Republicans. We've got to get more Republicans because you know, they say we have a majority.
Well, one in the Senate, very few in the House. We need more to get it done. We are going to get it done one way or the other, but we need more - - with your help, we're going to elect more Republicans and we're going to deliver even more.
Now, again, other than healthcare, which frankly we got rid of the individual mandate which is the worst part of Obamacare, we are doing association healthcare very soon, it's coming out over the next couple weeks, which is going to be incredible where you are going to buy great healthcare, highly competitive.
Remember, I used to talk during the debates, get rid of the state lines. We're getting rid of the state lines. You'll be able to go out in groups and buy great healthcare at a very low and competitive price.
And essentially, we are getting rid of Obamacare; some people would say, essentially we got rid of it, but you no longer have the individual mandate. You remember what that is. That's where you had the privilege -- a real -- a privilege of going out and spending a lot of money so that you had the second privilege of not having to buy healthcare.
So you paid for the privilege of not buying healthcare. We got rid of it in the tax cut plan. Big thing. Big thing. That was so unconstitutional, but that was the worst part of Obamacare. We got rid of that and you see what's going on, and we're really producing -- and except for one vote. Remember the one vote? Three o'clock in the morning thumbs down. What a vote that was. What a vote that was. That was some vote.
But despite that, it's going to come out great. So we have gotten rid of a lot of Obamacare. We're going to rid of the rest. We got you the tax cuts. We want every American to know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job well done, there is nothing like it. Together we can lift millions of Americans from welfare to work, from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity.
We are supporting job training and we are supporting vocational schools, right? Vocational schools. You know, I said to the guys, I said these community colleges, they are wonderful, but nobody knows really what a community college is.
When I was growing up, we had things called vocational schools. And I'd go to a school and I'd be sitting next to a guy, I never looked at his papers because he didn't do well. On the other side, I would have somebody not too good, but you know what? They could take an engine apart blindfolded and fix it.
They could build a brick wall better than all of the guys in the class and gals together. They could do things that nobody else could do and nobody knows what a community college is.
We are going to start using -- and we had these -- vocational schools where you learn trades, and you will do it and you will love it and you will make much more money than anything else you can do, right?
Those are the people we need in our country right now. We need skilled people and when people come across the border, we want to take them in, but we want to take them in based on merit, not based on a lottery. Lottery, lottery.
We want them to come in based on skill and based on merit so they can love our country, they can help our country, they can do things for our country, not come in based on some random lottery system. Aand that will happen. It's all happening.
We're going to build new bridges and airports and highways and waterways all across this magnificent land and you know what we are doing with your locks, we are going to start that as soon as I get back.
I told your congressman, write that name down for me, the Army Corps of Engineers, we're going to be calling them. It could be tonight depending on the time I get back. But it might be tomorrow even though it's a Sunday. Can I call on a Sunday? Is that okay? No? Your lock is not working too well, right? Not working too well.
Well, it hasn't been fixed in 50 years in all fairness. It would be nice to fix it. After spending all of that money in the Middle East, can you imagine? We can't fix a lock? But we'll get it fixed. We're going to put new steel into the spine of our country and breathe new life and new hope into our beautiful communities.
And in everything we do, in every decision we make, we will stand up and -- we are going to be proud. You know what? We're going to be proud of America again. We are going to stand up for America and we are not going to apologize anymore for America.
You know, I told you before, we have done a lot. We have done more than anybody in a year. We're for 16 months, and honestly it just feels like we have been here a long time together because the fight has been a long fight. But did you ever think we would have accomplished what we have accomplished in this short period of time?
You know, part of the problem the country had and one of the reasons our jobs are doing so well, our companies are doing so well, wages are going up because we had regulations which were staggering. It would take 20 years to get a highway or roadway approved, environmentally. It would take years and years to get the simplest permits.
I got rid of those rules and regulations. And by the way, we're going to have crystal clean water. We are going to have beautiful clean air. We're going to be great. We are going to reject people if they don't have the right project, but projects aren't going to take 18 years to get approved, and then in many cases, it's thumbs down after working 18 years. No, we're going to get it done.
We are going to stand up for places like Detroit that need help. We're going to stand up and we're going to stand up for great states like Michigan, and we have done that. This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line. This is it. It's the state that gave us Motown, the Mustang and the might of the American Midwest. It's a great state.
It is where generations of proud workers at General Motors and Chrysler and Kellogg transformed our nation and changed the entire world. We were the leader, and now we are the leader again, and everybody is seeing it. And don't forget this, we have increased the values over the last 16 months tremendously.
We are almost twice the size of the next largest economy. Remember that. Don't forget that. Don't forget that. And we are going to be growing very fast. It's time to look past the old divisions, tired thinking. The stale debates of the and finally come together as one nation under God. One nation under God. We are one people with one home, and one great American destiny.
Remember what I said, they are looking at us all over the world. When chancellor Merkel came in to see me, she said, Congratulations, Mr. President. What you have done is incredible with your economy. When President of France came in to see me, President Macron, wondering guy -- Emmanuel, we like shaking each other's hand. Now, he's a great guy and she's terrific. But you know what? She is for Germany. He is for France. I'm for the USA, okay? Does that make sense?
But Emmanuel came in and when Angela came in, they said, Amazing, congratulations. What we have done in a short period of time is incredible. So regulations -- we have cut more regulations in this 15 to 16 months than any other President has cut in four years, eight years or as you know, FDR, in one case 16 years, and it's not even close.
We inherit the legacy of the great Americans who constructed the railroads, came to the frontiers, built the highways, carved out the Panama Canal and put a man on the face of the moon.
By the way, excuse me, did you see how our space program is going? A little different. And we are letting those rich guys that like rockets, go ahead, use our property, pay us some rent. Go ahead. You can use Cape Canaveral. You just pay us rent and spend that money. Pretty amazing, right?
We're the engine -- you know, it wasn't going up. That was great. But how about where the engines come down. They come down. They come down. They land so they can use them again. That looks like a futuristic beautiful stuff.
We have reinvigorated our Space Program to a level that nobody thought possible in this short period of time. NASA is back. NASA is back and Mars is waiting for us. You know that. Great.
You know what it is? It's great. It's science. It's important. Very important militarily, folks. Very important. We have the best military. We now again, we have the best military in the world. We are going to have a military, the likes of which, nobody has ever had. The best that we have ever had by far, and these are the times when you want to have a very powerful military. You don't want to have to use it, but you have to have it.
We stand on the shoulders of patriots who poured out their sweat and blood and tears for our country, for our flag and for our God. As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing beyond our reach. There is nothing. Look what happened to us? Right? Here we are. Look what happened to us.
You know, a poll came out the other day, Rasmussen. I was at 51 percent, and then they said -- you don't read about that. You never hear them talking. You watch this fake CNN. Well, the polls -- do you ever notice? They're always talking. Do you ever notice CNN, Well, you know, he's not very popular. They were saying that before the last election victory, and now, we are much higher than that, but they said 51 percent -- and then somebody, some genius analyst said, But he's got at least 10 percent of the people that don't want to say they are voting for him.
And you know what I say to that? We'll take them anyway, whatever it takes.
I don't know if it's an insult or not, but you know what? We love those people because those people came out in the last election and they said, Don't talk to us. We would like to know how you voted. Don't talk to me. They go in Trump, they come out.
Remember the exit polls? The exit polls. They come out, Who did you vote for? None of your business. A hundred percent, those people are for Trump. We love those people. We love them. We love those people.
You know, there was a mayor of a certain city -- by the way, by the way, by the way, is this better than that phony Washington White House Correspondents Dinner? Is this more fun?
I could be up there tonight smiling like I love where they are hitting you shot after shot. These people hate your guts, shot -- and then I'm supposed to -- and you know, you have got to smile. If you don't smile, they will say, He was terrible. He couldn't take it. And if you do smile, they will say, What was he smiling about? You know, there's no win...
We are proud to be America and the future belongs to us. The future belongs -- remember that. The future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. This is our moment. We've never had a moment like this. The economy is raging. Our military is strong and getting stronger. Every single day, we are ordering the greatest equipments in the world. We make the greatest military equipment in the world. Look at what happened in Syria. Boom, boom, bing.
You know, after the attack -- we had to do that. People cannot use gas. Frankly, they shouldn't use anything, but they can't drop the gas, and it was gas. But you know, when we did it, do you remember? It came out, Oh, they hit 23 of our missiles. Then they said, We shot 43 and they hit 43 of our missiles. We shot 110. You know how many they hit? None. Zero. None.
You know how many of our missiles hit their target? One hundred percent. One hundred percent. And the British and the French were great. Great team. It's a great team. But this is our chance. We've never had a chance like this. We are taking our country back. You have just no idea. So many people come up to me, Thank you, sir, thank you. I say, For what? For what? You are taking our country back.
It's true. So many people, they say, Thank you, sir. I always say, For what? They say, Sir, you are taking our country back, and it's true. It's true. We are all taking our country back.
You know in the great state of Tennessee, a congressman, a wonderful guy, came up to me, they had early voting. This was before the election, they have early voting and he came up to me and the voting had just started, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech. He's a friend of a Pennsylvania congressman and they were together in Pennsylvania and he comes up to me and he goes, I wasn't President then, we were campaigning and the election had just started.
So, with the early voting he says to me, You know, Mr. Trump, he called me, he goes, I don't know what's happening in the rest of the country, but Tennessee early voting -- I have been doing this stuff for 25 years and I have never seen anything like it. People are great Americans but they never voted before because they never had anybody they wanted to vote for. They work hard. They pay taxes. They are coming out of the hills and out of the valleys. They have got the red caps on, they have got to make America great on. They've got the Trump on and I don't know what's happening, but if every place is like Tennessee, you're going to win this election, Mr. Trump.
True. So true. He said, I have never seen anything like it. And you know what? We are higher now than we were on Election Day. We are higher now because now, people are seeing the results. It's actually easier because people are actually seeing the results.
Before I said, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. We are going to get a tax cut. We're going to get rid of the individual mandate. We are going to do all of these things. Judges, regulations -- now I have done it.
Somebody from the news -- I won't call it, in this case, fake news because he turns out to be right -- he said, Trump is one of the first people ever that actually accomplished more than he promised. And it's true. I accomplished -- I am a politician, I guess, but I accomplished more than I promised, and I'm doing it for you.
Our great journey together is just beginning. So with love in our hearts and hope in our souls, I say these words again, you have heard them before, you've liked them before, we can't say them too much because together we'll make America strong again. Together, we will make America wealthy again. Together, we will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
Hello, everyone. Hi. Hi, everybody. Hello, everybody. It was a little rocky up in the sky tonight, I have to say. They said, "Sir, would you mind going back? Would you mind if we didn't stop?" I said, "There's no way. We cannot stop," right?
No, we're not going to do that. We're not going to do that for a man named Henry McMaster. We're not going to do that. I wouldn't have the courage to call Henry. Henry, I said I was coming, but I'm only kidding. It's raining out real bad and we're not showing up. I wouldn't do it to you, so thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
And also it is the Air Force One. I said let's just go through and it does. Listen, it is great, it is great to be with you. It's a very special state. I love this state with so many incredible, hardworking American patriots at -- American patriots.
Before we begin, let's all take a moment to send our love to Katie Arrington, who was badly hurt in a terrible car accident. And somebody going the wrong way and Katie really badly hurt along with a friend of hers and somebody else killed frankly in the other car. And Katie is a very special person. She was out there right from the beginning. And here's the good news, she's going to be 100 percent. That's the good news. She's going to be 100 percent.
So, Katie, we're all pulling for you and we're praying for your very swift recovery. She's going to be back very soon. And she was with us, boy, she was out there campaigning against a guy I've never liked too much. Never liked him too much. I wasn't a big fan. The Tallahassee Trail must be a beautiful place. Unfortunately, he didn't go there.
So I want to thank all of our South Carolina GOP leaders in attendance. We have a man who has become a friend of mine. It's shocking, isn't it? It's shocking. We went at it and he said, "I'll defeat him in South Carolina." I said, "I don't think so. I don't think so." But I'll tell you what, he has become a friend and he's a good man, Lindsey Graham.
Lindsey. That's pretty good I think, Lindsey. That's pretty good. No, he's been great. Congressman Joe Wilson and Tom Rice. South Carolina attorney general, a very close personal relationship to Joe, Alan Wilson. Good job, Alan. He's looking good. South Carolina Secretary of State Mark Hammond. Thank you, Mark. And candidate for lieutenant governor Pamela Evette. Pamela. Thanks, Pamela.
And finally the person we are all here for today, a man who truly was with me from the beginning. There was no doubt about it. He was there right from the beginning. We won the state of South Carolina by a lot both in the primaries, both in the primaries and in the general election. We won it. We had to run the whole east coast and we got South Carolina and we got North Carolina. We love North Carolina.
We got Pennsylvania and we got Florida. We started off that night. Donald Trump has won the State of Florida, right? And they go, whoa, whoa, they just lost Florida. And you know what they said? Don't worry about it, North Carolina -- they said North Carolina is our firewall. South Carolina we have no chance, but North Carolina. And so we won South Carolina, thank you very much.
And the firewall wasn't much of a firewall in North Carolina. So I want to thank the incredible people of South Carolina for everything you've done. And right from day one when I came down here, Henry McMaster, I said, "So why are you with me?" He said, "Because I like what you're saying. I agree. We need strong borders." We're talking about it now and we have.
So he said we need strong borders, we have to stop crime, we want lower taxes, we love our military, we love our vets and we love our second amendment. Other than that, I don't know what he said.
I don't know what else he told me, but you know what, that was enough, right? And he was sort of this like handsome guy with a wonderful wife, Peggy. Where's Peggy?
So Henry was for me from the beginning. There was nobody else. It wasn't like I supported Trump. Somebody says I supported Donald Trump very early, yes, after seven other people. After the defeat of nine people, they were with me and they never let you forget it. But Henry was there at the beginning. He's a fighter, he's tough, he's strong and he's a gentleman. He's a gentleman.
The thing with Henry because I really got to know him, I tell you what, he was up early in the morning, he left late at night. I said, "You really are a fighter." The beautiful thing with Henry is you don't even know it. He does it in a very elegant manner, but he is a fighter. He's been here with us. And, Henry, I'd like to ask you just to come on up. This has been an interesting voyage over here. I have never taken a longer trip. I have never taken a longer trip ever to South Carolina. Come here, Henry.
Thank you, Mr. President. South Carolina loves Donald Trump. You all, we were at the airport waiting and we were watching these forces of nature and there was lightening and there was the thunder and the storm and the rain. And then it cleared and Air Force One landed and the real force of nature got off the plane and stepped into South Carolina.
Donald Trump has kept every promise that he's made. We love him. We follow him. He's going to make America great again. We will help him do it. We're going to do it right in South Carolina. Thank you so much.
Thank you, Henry. Now, you know we have a lot of fake news back there, these fakers. And you know that if a horrible thing happened and we weren't lucky enough to have Henry win, you know they won't talk about it, they will say Donald Trump suffered a major, major defeat in the great state of South Carolina. It was a humiliating defeat for Donald Trump. So please get your asses out tomorrow and vote.
You got to get out there and vote. And, honestly, not for that reason, you want to get out. He's a great man. He's a wonderful person. He loves the people of South Carolina. He loves the people of our country. You got a good man or I wouldn't be here, believe me, I wouldn't be here.
You know, the last time I endorsed somebody, as you know, was Katie and I was in Singapore. There's like this massive difference in time. Who knows? I said, "Let me ask you, we have a situation that's very interesting. I'm turning on the television, I see the race and I say, what time is it right now in South Carolina?" They said, "Sir, it's almost four o'clock." I said, "Oh, I've got to endorse Katie." I said, "How many hours are left?" They said like three and a half. I said, "Maybe I shouldn't do it because I won't have enough." And what happened, I did. I said I don't care. I can't stand that guy.
I don't care. I don't care. And I like her. She was another one right from the beginning. She didn't talk about other people, right? So I said OK. So we had like three hours, three and a half hours left something. I'm just lifting off from Singapore far away. It was a 22-hour flight. Do you think that's fun? That's not even fun in Air Force One, OK? "When are we landing?" "Sir, we're almost there, seven more hours." Oh, good. When they tell you you're almost there, you only have seven hours left. And, by the way, we had a great success, North Korea. Chairman Kim, great, great success.
We're not looking up in the air. Any rockets up there? Any rockets? Japan is very happy, they haven't had a rocket shut over them in seven months. There's been no rocket tests. There's been no nuclear tests. There's been no ballistic missiles. They've blown up their site. Today, it got no coverage because fake news doesn't cover.
But today, look at all those fake newsers back there. Look at them. That's a lot. That's a lot of people. That's a lot of people. And you want to see a lot of people, go outside, this is a gymnasium. I said, "Henry, I don't work gymnasiums anymore." He said, "Please." I said, "OK, I'll be there." Go outside and take a look outside. You won't believe what's going on out there. So you people understand real estate well.
But we have a call and I had numerous calls with Prime Minister Abe, so happy for the people of Japan. They're happy for the people of China. They're happy for the people especially of South Korea and were happy. And you know what, we did something that was wonderful and the world is soon going to be and right now it is already, we have good chemistry, but the world is going to be a much safer place. And North Korea is going to be a much better place, so it was really something, really something.
And they've agreed to denuclearization. They've agreed to no more testing, no more of this. They agreed. By the way, we got our hostages back. We got our hostages. I got them back even before we left. We're getting the remains of our great heroes back.
And when I first made the announcement that we're getting together, this was five, six months ago, it was in the Oval Office. I'll never forget it and these guys were saying unbelievable, unbelievable. Do you believe this?
South Korea, remember, they came over from South Korea, they stopped, North Korea, South Korea, the Olympics, and it started with the Olympics which Chairman Kim said, "We want to go to the Olympics." I said, "Yes, that's nice." That's a big difference from the dialogue we were having, right? Slight, slight. They want to go to the Olympics. And the Olympics would have been a massive failure and it turned out to be a massive success.
And President Moon of South Korea gives us the credit. They were not selling. People did not want to be nuked in stadium as they watched the opening ceremonies. They don't want to be watching the opening ceremonies and at the same time looking at up the skies, how long will this last? They were not exactly selling tickets, the minute that happened and he said, "We'd like to be part of the Olympics" out of nowhere. The minute that happened, the Olympics became a fantastic success. It was a great Olympics. It was a great Olympics.
And we now have a good chemistry. We have a good chemistry. I think it's going to work out. And it's a period of time, takes a while, takes a long time, not easy, not easy. They've been doing this for many, many decades and not that easy, but they took down signs, anti-United States sign, all over North Korea down.
They took them down, anti-U.S. signs like I put up anti-media signs all over the place. You're worse than I am. No, we just want honesty. We want a little fairness. We want a little fairness, right? We want that. We don't get very much of it.
But it's sort of interesting, so we make the deal. And we signed a piece of paper and it was a beautiful piece of paper, it said we will denuke, we will this, we will that, we will get the remains back, we will do all of these things, a lot of things. We will not test, we will abandon our -- they have an engine site for, these are not engines like for your car. These are engines for ballistic missiles. They got to rip that down. So point after point after, but it starts off first sentence,, we will denuclearize North Korea, OK.
So you know what the fake news said? Donald Trump has suffered a humiliating defeat because I agreed to meet, I said I agreed to meet. In other words, because I agreed to meet they couldn't think of anything else. So I will say this, at the beginning they couldn't believe it was happening. Two days later, they were saying Hillary Clinton could have done that. I don't think so. I don't think so.
Did you ever see anybody so protected in your life? Did you ever see that? Point after point after point, and I did nothing and it just never ends, never ends. No collusion, no nothing. But you go point and you know what after the election I said, OK, let's go, come on, who cares? Let's go. We got to make America great again. And then she writes a book and she does the tour, and how many reasons that she give for losing the election, like every week there was a different reason, right? She blamed everybody for losing the election except for one person, herself.
And the funny thing is so, look, Lindsey was just telling me every other Republican it would have been very tough. They all lost. I won. I won when I won South Carolina, but to win all up and down the east coast, to win Wisconsin, which hasn't been won in many years, like 1972 I think, that's a long time, to win Michigan, which hasn't been won in a long time, and they give her, they say she was a bad candidate, I mean, honestly she was a tough candidate. She wasn't a bad candidate, but they refused to say that I was a good candidate. They refused.
It's very interesting, I just pick this out. Sometimes you have to toot your own horn because nobody else is going to do it. Certainly, they're not going to do it. No, no, certainly they're not.
Certainly, they're not going to do it so sometimes you have to do it, right? That's why when the polls are good, you remember during the campaign, when the polls were good I would always talk about it. When they weren't so good, I wouldn't mention it, right? I didn't talk polls. But they were good, for a lot of time they were good. And, by the way, Georgetown Steel just opened their plant yesterday.
They're spending a lot of money after many years of being closed, Georgetown Steel in South Carolina. So here's a story that just came out. David Lynch, the great filmmaker, David Lynch, he puts down headline, "Trump could go down..." He's a Hollywood guy. The reason I do this is you don't hear this, and plenty of them voted for me. Plenty of them voted for me.
David Lynch, could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history, of course there goes his career, right, in Hollywood. Veteran filmmaker, David Lynch, believes President Donald Trump could be remembered as one of the greatest presidents in American history because of the way he has shaken up the political establishment because of what I've done.
However, he now appears to believe because he was a Democrat or is a Democrat or something, he actually voted for Obama. And here it says he voted for Bernie Sanders, OK, but he now says, however, he now appears to believe that Trump may have been the right choice after all.
He goes on to say that Trump could go down as one the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted this thing so much. No one has been able to counter this guy in an intelligent way. And, by the way, they call them the elites, right, the elites. You know what you are? You're the super elites. I'm changing titles. I'm changing. I'm changing. No, no.
Look, everybody here makes money, works hard, pays taxes, does a great job. You're smarter, you're better, you're more loyal. We have the greatest face in the history of politics. They interviewed 10 women on one of the opposing networks, the enemy, the enemy of the people I call them. And they said to these women, these were about 10 really great women, these are none political women that had Trump here, Trump there, wearing Trump hats. Badges -- so this announcer said, "What can he do?"
And you've heard me say this because this happens a lot. "What can he do where you won't be with him? What can he do when you're going to drop Donald Trump?" And one of these women stood out, perhaps the leader, perhaps not, but she came forward and she said, "There's absolutely nothing he can do." Can you believe that? There is nothing he can do.
And she said he has done a great job so we're working on it. But there's David Lynch, enjoy it because his career is Hollywood is officially over. Did you see Jimmy Fallon? Jimmy Fallon.
The guy screws up my hair. He's going back and forth. He was so disappointed to find out it was real. He couldn't believe it. Well, that's one of the great things I got. Everybody used to say my hair is phony, it's not my hair, I'm wearing a hair piece. Anybody here wearing a hair piece now? But the one thing, they never say that anymore because I've been caught in rainstorms. I've been caught in winds that are like 60 miles an hour getting off. If it's not your hair, don't run for office, folks. Don't run. Do not run for office because the gig would be up.
So Jimmy Fallon apologized. He apologized for humanizing me, the poor guy because now he's going to lose all of us. Now, he's going to lose all of us. If somebody would open a talk show at night because the guy on CBS is -- what a low life, what a low life. I mean, honestly, are these people funny? And I can laugh at myself and frankly if I couldn't I be in big trouble. But there's no talent, they're not talented people.
Johnny Carson was talented. Some of these guys, no, seriously. I mean, this guy on CBS, has no talent. Jimmy Kimmel would meet me before the election. I'm telling you a true story. I don't even think he'd deny it. No talent, but I go to his studio to do a shot, to a do a thing, he would stand outside on the sidewalk waiting for me. "Oh, here he comes, Donald Trump, oh." He opens my door. I said does he do this to everybody, to his people? He does it for nobody. Now, who knows? Maybe that was just -- but he's waited for me two or three times I did a show before this. Now, he wouldn't do his show. That guy's terrible.
But I do a show and he's standing out on Hollywood, whatever, Boulevard and he's standing there opening up the door like, "Hello." I wasn't president. I was just like a guy, right? A guy with potential, right?
Good potential. And he's there, here he is. "Oh, sorry, how are you? Hi. So thank you so much for doing..." And I always got higher ratings than other people so that was always good.
But Jimmy Fallon calls me up and he's like a nice guy. He's lost. He looks like a lost soul, right? He gets out there, "Hey, hey, hi, oh." But you know what, he's a nice guy. I agreed to do a show and because I guess I was running at that time, I think I was, it was he got tremendous ratings on that show, killed everybody, right? He should be thankful. He couldn't be upset and angry, when you apologize because you got somebody else that didn't go on the other shows.
So I go on the show, I agree, do whatever you want with my hair, go ahead, let's go, and that was it. He woke up like what is it, a year and a half, two years later he's now apologizing because he humanized me and he really hurt himself.
So I said, "Jimmy, you called me up after the show and you said thank you for the incredible -- you called them monster ratings, they were very big ratings." I said, "Thank you, Jimmy, that's very nice." I said, "Don't hurt yourself by apologizing." So I said to him today on social media, I said, "Jimmy, be a man. Just relax. Just relax." It's incredible.
But if somebody had said to these guys that CBS, NBC, I made a fortune for NBC on The Apprentice, they treat me horribly. I think they're worse actually than CNN. I think NBC...
And they wanted to renew my contract. They wanted to renew my contract and they were doing everything. They had the top man at Comcast came up to see me in my office with a whole group of people, please, please renew your contract for The Apprentice. I said that's what I knew I was going to run so I turned it down. You know it's a primetime show doing well, 14 seasons, did great. Hey, Arnold Schwarzenegger, big movie star, took my place, it bombed in about two shows it was over. It actually bombed in one show. It was so bad they didn't believe it so they let it go a little bit longer. And the one who knew it was my wife, my wife.
She said, you know -- she's very smart. She said, "You know there's nobody that can take your place, don't you?" I said, "Thank you, darling. I appreciate it." How smart is that? Now, I don't know if she believes it, but she said there is nobody that can take your place. He will not be successful. I said he's doing no shows. "He will not be successful. There is nobody, darling, that can take your place." How smart is she? How smart, right? How smart.
And she has got a great style. We greeted today the king of Jordan and the queen of Jordan and it was like a picture. I watched the three of them, the queen, the king and the first lady, and I stood back and I watched. I didn't want to destroy that picture. And I will tell you, she has done a tremendous job as first lady.
And you know, she had an operation a few a weeks ago, kidney operation, and she's going to be great. She's fine. But they had all kinds of projections. They said she got a facelift. No. I would let you know. They couldn't hide that one for long, right? They said she left me and moved to Virginia. They said she left me and, all right, moved to New York. So she moved to Virginia, she moved to New York. The only thing they wouldn't say is what happened and that's OK. And she's private, she doesn't want to talk about things, right? But really unfair stuff, but you know what, we've never done better than we're doing now. We've never had a time like we're having. We've never had. We've never had higher polls than we have now.
Even Gallup, Gallup, who treats me horribly, polls are fake news also. What they do is called suppression. They put out these horrible polls and then they hope that everyone's going to say, "Hey, look, I like Trump, but he's got no chance of winning." Suppression, it should be illegal actually. You want to check these pollsters, where they're coming from, they knew.
We had one with ABC, I think it was ABC Washington Post just before the election, like a week before we're down 12. Now, if you're down 12, OK, if you're down 12 it's over if the polls are real. But I said it can't be real, we just went to Michigan, we had 30,000 people, we just went to other places. Excuse me, we went to South Carolina, but I didn't come here that often, you know why? Because we were leading by a lot.
So, I said -- I said, if you don't mind -- I said, "If you don't mind, do you mind if I don't come back here? I got to go to places like that we have it a little bit closer?" And nobody said, "Don't worry about it," they said, "You stay out of here, Mr. President, almost to be, Mr. President." But it really has been an incredible journey for all of us. We are the super elite, we are the super elite.
It is true. We are and we're going to call ourselves that. I said the other day because as you saw in my last speech, it's in Minnesota, great place, unbelievable crowd. It seated nine thousand and they had 15,000 or 20,000 people outside couldn't get in, it was incredible, just like you have a lot of people outside, you just can't.
If I ever come into an arena, and it's got empty seats, I think that's the end. I don't know I'll be able to take it, right? I don't know, Henry, what I'm going to do if that happens, huh? I don't think we'll be able to take it. Well, it's not going to happen. Because remember what I said, we're going to start winning again, we're winning, we're winning now. Like we haven't won before. Like we have not won before.
We're winning with our military, our military is now being built up like you wouldn't believe. We're winning with our military, we're winning on trade, we're winning on trade. We're defending our borders, because if you don't have borders, you don't have a country, you don't have it.
Oh, it's happening. That's happening. Oh, it's happening. It's not build that wall anymore, it's continue building that wall, because we're building it. We're building it, we're fixing it miles and miles, we've got $1.6 billion, we're fixing the wall, we're building wall in San Diego, it's incredible how nobody wants the wall until it's in their backyard, do you mind building us? They didn't like people walking across their front lawns in San Diego.
So, we're building the wall, we're fixing the wall, we're spending a lot of money, and we're going for more, and we'll get it done. But Democrats, they want open borders, and they don't mind crime. Think of it.
So last week they thought, "Oh, they have a great issue," and, you know, I get credit, I don't know if it's true or not, but they're saying I have good political instincts, who does?
In fact, some people have said, I have the greatest political instinct in 50 years. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. But I have my own feeling. And when I heard them talking about the children, first of all they were using pictures taken in 2014 when Barack Obama was president. I wasn't president.
And what I learned is one thing, our facilities are cleaner, better kept, and better run, that's the one thing I learned, OK? I saw that. But what we have is two extremes. You know, I liked it, I said, "Hey, this is fine for us." The Democrats want to open borders, they want anybody they wanted including MS-13 pouring into the country. And the Democrats don't like ICE, these are great, brave, tough people.
These people are much tougher than MS-13. They don't like Border Patrol, they don't like your police, they don't like anybody. The Democrats want to protect illegals coming into this country, some of whom are not good, some of whom cause lots of problems in the worst possible way, they want to protect illegals coming into the country, much more so than they want to protect you, and that's not where we're coming from, OK?
So, I defined it today, the Democrats want open borders and they don't mind crime. We want very tight, very strict borders, and by the way, you saw a 70 year or low, with all the complaining I'm doing, we've done a very good job, and we have taken thousands, we have taken -- we got to get that wall built all the way across, and they don't want it, that's like a symbol.
They're only good at one thing -- what's that term? Resist. It's the party of Maxine Waters, do you believe her?
No, no. No, no. This has become the party of Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, that's who it is. So they don't mind crime, they want open borders, we one really tough borders, and we want people to come in, we want people to come in through the legal process, what about the thousands of people? What about the thousands of people that have gone through this process, that are waiting on line to come into our country, and then we're going to let these people pour in?
We have no idea who they are, and they came to me three days ago. Sir, we'd like you to sign this order. What is the order? We need five thousand judges on the border. I said, "Judges?" What other country has judges? I said, "How many do we have now?" They didn't even know. So we have thousands of judges and now we're going to have five thousand. Now, I've done a good job with judges, Judge Gorsuch, Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch.
And we have many judges, we will set the record I believe for the most judges appointed, which is a very important thing, we're putting great talented people who see the Constitution the way it's written, they don't make up the Constitution.
But they come up, and this was an order, this was -- sir, we need five thousand judges, I said, five thousand? So, we put a judge on like on the bench, federal, it takes us weeks to vet, it takes us a long time to get the judges, one -- we're talking about one person. And they want five thousand, I said, "Where are you going to find five thousand people to be judges? How many do we have now?" I don't know the number. They don't even know the number, even though they're in charge, OK? Nobody knows the number. We have thousands of judges already.
So, if a person comes into our country, steps one foot, they take their name, they bring them to court, they then release them, they go into the country, you never see them again. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. So, I said today, I said today, I don't want judges, I want ICE and Border Patrol Agents, that's what I want.
I want it, that's all. And we want to tell people, I'm sorry, you're coming into the country illegally, we don't want you in the country, that's it, it's now over. You know that I heard a number today which is hard to believe, we have 700,000 people waiting to go on trial, 700, this isn't from Trump, it was a disaster for Bush, although we very much appreciated Laura Bush's lovely letter, it was a disaster for Bush, it was a disaster for Obama, in fact, the head of his homeland was on over the weekend, and he -- honestly, he was very honest about it.
He said it was a tough thing, it was a tough time for them. But we're going to straighten it out. Hey look. I got a bad hand, I got the job, and trade deals were bad. I mean, how bad were trade deals?
Trade deals were bad. North Korea, they thought they were going to war, you go to war with North Korea, you're going to lose anywhere from 30 to 50 million people. Seoul is a city with 28 million people, 28 million people. So, you go, and you go to war, you lose 30, 40, 50, who knows? Millions of people, and I'm not even talking about nuclear, they have thousands of cannons aimed right at Seoul.
And I said, huh, I'm telling you before I got -- took over this office, there was a really good chance that we were going to war with North Korea, you could have lost millions, and millions of people. So, I got a bad hand with North Korea because that's should've been done years ago.
I got a bad hand with all these horrible trade deals, NAFTA is a disaster, Mexico is going to make over one hundred billion dollars in the United States this year, Canada, you know, Canada, nice guy, nice guy, Prime Minister Justin, I said, "Justin, what's your problem, Justin?" So, Canada, "Oh, Canada," I love their national anthem, "Oh, Canada," I like ours better, however.
So, you know, Canada is great, I love Canada, but -- and we had a wonderful understanding, you know that story, we hugged, we kissed, everybody was happy, I made some changes in this ridiculous thing that everybody agreed to sign, so it was meaningless, but I made some changes. I left everybody was happy, Prime Minister Abe said, "President Trump was right, everybody was in love." They took the picture with Merkel, but if they showed the picture of like two minutes later, I had a big smile, she had a big smile, we were friendly, everybody.
I get onto Air Force One, and he doesn't understand that Air Force One has 22 televisions. So, I come on, they have televisions in closets, they have televisions in areas that no place has -- unlimited budget, Air Force One, huh?
So I get onto the plane, and I see Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada saying, Canada will not be bullied by the United States, I said, "So, what are we doing here?" The fact is that Canada has a 275 percent tariff on dairy products, little thing called dairy products. Their lumber is a disaster with us, I say, why aren't we using our own lumber? Because now we're actually allowed to take lumber from our fields and regrow it, but take lumber from under our environmental system, in the old days you couldn't do that, we had to go to other countries, but we -- so lumber is a disaster, energy is a disaster, and, you know, I see Justin saying, "We fought World War I together, fought World War II together," that's true, we love Canada.
But Canada is charging almost 300 percent tariffs on dairy products and many other things, it's all working out great. It's all working out great. But I said, "Look, if you want to do that, we're going to put a little tariff when your cars are coming in," you know, cars are the biggie. Cars are the biggie. European Union, we lost $151 billion last year with the European Union. Sounds nice, many of us originally came from somewhere in the European Union. I had two parents, European Union.
So, it sounds wonderful, our country lost 151 billion. They send a Mercedes, they send BMW's, they send everything, we tax them practically nothing, we can't send our cars, and if we do, they charge many, many times the tax that we stupidly don't charge. So I told them, "Here's what we're going to do, we're going to charge a tariff on steel, until such time as you straighten out your act and you let us have fair." They don't...
They don't let our farmers into the European Union, it's very hard. So we have farmers that want to sell, you don't hear these stories, this is why, with these people, they don't tell you these stories. The European Union has what they call trade barriers, the European Union doesn't allow our farmers to go and trade, it's very hard for them to go to trade. And if they do, it's very expensive, same like Canada.
Essentially, when you're paying a 275 percent tax and now I'm understanding it's higher, but at 275, that's essentially a trade barrier, you can't trade. How can we trade? We can't pay that kind of a tax. So, I want the barriers taken down, I want our farmers to be able to trade, I want to be able to sell cars in there just like they sell cars in here.
And it's all going to work out, it's all going to work out. Remember this, remember this, it's all going to work out, because we're the piggy bank that they like to take from, whether it's military protection, you look at NATO, NATO, we're spending 90 percent of NATO, now it's all wonderful, and we like to help out, but it helps them, they're in Europe, it helps them a lot more than it helps us, we're very far away.
So we have this incredible -- Germany is paying one percent of a much smaller GDP. We're paying close to four percent of a much larger GDP. Now, that doesn't work, folks. It doesn't work. So, I think we should pay the same as Germany, I just think we should pay the same as Germany.
So we're working all of these things, but the fact is, we were given somewhat of a bad hand, because we came in they had all these problems, but I love it, I'm loving what we're doing, you people are loving what we're doing.
We have the great Peter Navarro. I'll tell you one thing, Peter Navarro does like tariffs, he probably likes them more than I do, there's Peter Navarro right there, raise your hand, Peter.
So, they're all calling. They all want to make deals, before I did this, they weren't calling the Obama administration, but the Obama administration -- and in all fairness, the Bush Administration didn't care, it wasn't their thing. Last year on trade, our country lost $817 billion with a B, billion dollars, 817. We lost $817 billion, who the hell can do that? I mean, we don't have to be perfect, we don't even have to get it down to zero, but we can't lose 800 -- and so, because you feel like sort of stupid, don't you? Don't you feel stupid?
And the biggest, of course, was China, China made anywhere depending on the way you count from $375 billion, we built China, and I really like President Xi, but we built China. And they did help us on the border with North Korea, they might not be helping us anymore, and that would be too bad. But, that would be too bad.
And I've been as nice as I can as long as I can, but we've got to get some balance, and it doesn't have to be perfect, but there's got to be some fairness, you know, I'm a believer in free trade, but I'm really a believer in fair trade. This is -- this is ridiculous.
And I said to a man in China, how did it get so bad? Because they know the gig is up. How did it get so bad? And remember this, you know, we picked up since I got elected, we picked up tremendous worth, we've picked up anywhere from nine to seven, to seven to nine trillion dollars. We're almost twice the size of China's economy, nobody knows that. Nobody knows that.
Nobody knows that. So I said, how did it get so bad? He said, well, what happened is we would put on a tax on cars, you know, in China, if you sell a car into China from the United States, they charge you a 25 percent tax, if China sells a car into the United States, we charge them two and a half percent. So it's two and a half percent versus 25 percent, somehow I'm looking at this rich guy right over here, that doesn't work too well, do you agree? That's not a big worker, right? I bet you're a very successful guy. I could see. I can see the eyes, you know, big success.
But that doesn't work too well, sir, does it? And we have many, many cases like that. We have many cases like that, so we're going to straighten it out, and they all want to negotiate, because they have to negotiate, I mean, honestly they have to negotiate.
It has to happen, it's not like -- that's not a threat, it's like the Iran Deal, we're so bad, we paid $150 billion to sign a horrible agreement, we gave $1.8 billion in cash to pick up four hostages.
They're the wealthiest hostages in the world. They have the highest net worth of any hostage in history. We paid nothing, nothing to North Korea, and he did a very smart thing, because it was goodwill, it was good. We did it before I even left. So, you know, there are a lot of good things, and a lot of good things are happening, folks. And it's all going to work out, and it's going to work out because we have a big advantage. Because remember, we're the bank and they're taking money from us hand over fist, but at some point that's got to stop. It's got to stop. We can lower your taxes which we did, we gave you the greatest tax cut in the history of our country.
Right? We have some incredible things happening with health care. We got very badly hurt, we had all the votes, and then one gentleman early in the morning, like 2:00 in the morning, he went, "No," well he campaigned on repealing and replace, we had all the votes, and perhaps he was grandstanding, who knows what he was doing? But you know what? He said, "No, no." Everybody said, "What the hell happened?" He's been campaigning for eight years repeal and replace, and he didn't do that, but now, what we've done in the tax cut is we've gotten rid of the individual mandate, the individual mandate.
We've gotten rid of it. And by the way, I have these stupid teleprompters, you don't mind that I haven't used them all night, do you? Every once in a while -- every once in a while I look at it, I mean, it's so boring, we don't want it. America's back, bigger, and better, and stronger than ever. You've heard that before.
No, I, you know, I'm looking, I keep looking, I just see things, and just -- they're true, but they're not quite as exciting. So, we are doing so well, we are lifting millions and millions of Americans from welfare to work.
From dependence to independence. And from poverty to prosperity, right? We're putting new American steel into the spine of our country and breathing new hope into our beautiful communities. True. The forgotten men and women of our country, our forgotten, where they're still trying to figure out who the hell were all these people that came and voted two years ago? Who are they? Who are they? Yeah.
All of us. They're trying to find, how do we get to the forgotten men and women? I said, I think you've lost them for a long time. Because just like this producer from Hollywood said, we're doing a real job, I don't believe, so now it's 511 days. I don't believe any administration -- and you're with us, we're partners in this whole deal, you know, when we came out, we're partners, this is not me. This is a whole group of people. I don't believe and I don't even think it's close that any president has done what we've done in 500 days.
Not only the judges, not only the biggest tax cuts, not only ANWR in Alaska. You know all about ANWR, one of the great drilling sites in the world, but nobody could get oil and gas, that nobody could get approved. Ronald Reagan couldn't get it. Nobody could. I didn't even want it until I heard everybody else wanted it and I said, "It's like a freebie. That's part of our tax cuts", tax cut and reform, right? We want cut. Please give me the word "cut", right?
You've heard that story. I want the word "cut". So, we cut regulations more than any president in history whether it's four years, eight years, 16 years.
And we have more cutting to do. And by the way, we want regulation. We want crystal clean water. We want beautiful, clean air. We want it more than anybody and our air and our water now is better than it ever has been, and we're going to keep it that way. It's important. It's very important.
So, as long as we are proud of who we are and we are very proud of who we are and what we're fighting for, we as a country will never ever fail. We'll never fail. We have 3.4 million new jobs since Election Day.
If I would have said during the campaign that I was going to create 3.4 million new jobs, that countries -- you have no idea what we're going through. Countries are trying to hold back their companies that used to be our companies from leaving and moving back to the United States. We have companies, Chrysler, so many companies coming back in to the United States. They want to be where the action is, not only because of the tax cuts, but for a lot of other reasons including frankly those regulation cuts.
But we have more jobs. We have higher stats. The manufacturers of the United States voted, they said "This is the single most optimism that manufacturers of this country have ever had", small business owners, the same thing. It's the most optimistic that they've ever been. They've never been this optimistic.
And I'll tell you something. I'd like to take the credit for this, but I can't because it's Henry. South Carolina is doing unbelievable business. Companies are pouring in. New jobs are way up. Your numbers are through the roof. You're a real leader. All over the country, they're looking at South Carolina. Well, your governor is a man named Henry McMaster. You're doing unbelievable numbers.
I didn't want to say that, Henry. I didn't want to say that, Henry. I wanted to take the credit for myself, but I figured South Carolina would understand, right? But we're standing on the shoulders of true American patriots who put down the railroads, built up the highways and dug out a thing called the Panama Canal and lost many lives doing it -- mosquitoes, lost many, many lives.
They crossed oceans. They trekked deserts. They scaled mountains and built the most incredible nation the world has ever seen, but our nation was going badly in the wrong direction for a long period of time. We have $7 trillion invested in the Middle East. What do we have? What do we have other than death and destruction? What do we have? What a decision that was to go in.
I believe it was the worst decision in the history of our country, and the way we got out was horrible. If you look at Iraq, the way we got out was horrible. Truly one of the worst decisions ever made in this country. $7 trillion and thousands of lives -- we count the lives on both sides, folks, millions of lives in my opinion, millions. You don't hear that, millions of lives. Our ancestors won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism and put a man on the face of the moon. And by the way, NASA is now open for business.
And I put a great man, a wonderful human being and a great leader, just a friend, Mike Pence, Vice President, in charge. And I had a meeting with Mike and a lot of the people running NASA. And I said, "Listen. You got rich guys. For whatever reason, they love rockets. We don't have to put up so much money. Let them put up the money and build." And you got all these guys sending rockets all over the place. We'll get the credit.
I said, "Lease them the land. Charge them a lot, but let's do it that way." That's a lot better. We're like a landlord. So, we're also doing our thing, but we do. You have all these rich guys. I don't know what it is. They love rockets. I said "this is great" because you can't send rockets up like down the street, right? You can't take the local plot, the local Walmart, the local store, and send the rocket.
So, we have these incredible big sites that are meant exactly for this with the gantries, will all of this infrastructure. Much of it hasn't been used in a long time. And we're back in business. But I said to them and I think the business people, "let the rich guys pay for it. We got the site. We got the real estate. Let them put their rockets up." You saw Elon the other day. He put a rocket. I never saw anything like it. Yes. I've been watching rockets go up my whole life. OK. After a while, it's like -- but what I thought was incredible was when the engines came back down.
Did you see that? The engines, they came back down. Now, they're only two. The third one is missing someplace, but that's OK. No. But I thought that was incredible. But you have all these rich guys, they are worth billions of dollars, they want to spend money on rocketry. I think it's great. And I told my people, "Let them do it because if they reach the moon with their money, we're going to take all the credit, OK?" They're going to forget about it. Nobody is going to remember their name, but they're going to remember our names. So, let them do it. Let them do it.
But to keep this momentum going, we need more Republicans in Washington and we need Governor Henry McMaster as a continuation in South Carolina. It's very important.
Come here, Henry -- because with your help, we're going to continue to win. Do you remember in the campaign? Henry, you remember, I'd come to South Carolina. I'd say, "we're going to win so much. You people are going to get so tired of winning." You're going to say, "Governor McMaster, please we can't stand winning anymore. Governor McMaster, go to Washington, talk to the president. We can't win anymore."
We're going to win. Remember I said we're going to win at trade. We're going to win at space. By the way, Henry, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Air Force, right, Air Force, and what are we going to do, Space Force. People love that.
It's going to be -- we talk about rockets going up, but, Henry, defense is now largely based with the satellites and everything else in space. And the problem is when you have the Air Force, I don't think they're going to really sort of -- they want those planes flying. They want it. But I don't think they're going to be focusing on space maybe like they should.
So, we're going to create a Space Force and it's going to be great. And we need that militarily and in many other ways, but we do need it militarily also. So, this week, it is so important to go out and vote for country, vote for family, vote for values. It's been values. Vote for victory and vote for Henry. He is a great, great gentleman. He's a great gentleman.
Because as a group, together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, Henry. And we will make America great again. Thank you, South Carolina. Thank you. Thank you.
Hello, West Virginia. Hello. What a great song. How great is that song? I am thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands of hard-working American patriots. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The people of West Virginia love our country, they honor our history and they always respect our great American flag, and this is a truly amazing time for our nation.
Our economy is booming like never before. Remember, I told you. And by the way, your state is booming like never before. Poverty is plummeting, our stock market is soaring, reached its all-time high, by the way, in history, which I view as: jobs, jobs, jobs. All-time high. And our great coal miners are back to work.
They're back to work. A lot of people said that wasn't going to happen, you're back to work. Not only back to work, they're opening up mines all over the place, we're opening up steel mills. And the steel mills need metallurgic coal, and those coal miners are working and the steel workers are working, and our whole country is working.
We're taking care of our veterans and our military will soon be more powerful than ever before. America is winning again, and America is respected again. I just left the United Nations. Believe me, they respect us now again. They all respect us. And what are we doing? We're putting America first, finally.
But a lot of what we've done, some people could say: "All of what we've done is at stake in November." Always fragile. We are just five weeks away from one of the most important congressional elections in our lifetimes. This is -- this is one of the big, big, in other words, that's true, I'm not running but I'm really running.
That's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates. I'm fighting for great candidates. You see what's going on. You see this horrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats. You see it happening right now. And they're determined to take back power by using any means necessary. You see the meanness, the nastiness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to get power and control. That's what they want, is power and control. We're not going to give it to them. We're going to keep it running the way it's been running. While Republicans are fighting every day for jobs, safety, opportunity, lack of crime, with them it's crime, open borders.
They've been on a mission to resist and obstruct, and destroy, and you see that over the last four days. You see it. It's up to each of you, with your precious vote. It is that -- you know in 2016, we have the same thing happening, the same thing. People are going to be very, very surprised. When you win the presidency, in theory, you're not supposed to do great in the midterm, but nobody's ever had a presidency like this, because I won the presidency.
So I won the presidency, which is really "we" won the presidency, and we have the greatest economy that this nation has ever seen, jobs and everything else. So we won - and we have so many things happening that are so good. So we should do well in the midterms. I can't imagine not, but you have to get -- don't be complacent.
The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that's going on over the last few days in the Senate. When you see the anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and nasty and untruthful, when you look at releases and leaks, and then they say: "Oh, I didn't do it, I didn't do it" Remember Dianne Feinstein.
Did you leak- Remember her answer? "Did you leak the document?", "Ahh, ahh, what? No, no. I didn't. Well, wait. One minute. Did we leak-- Oh, No, we didn't." I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language, who knows, maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language. I've ever seen. The entire nation has witnessed the shameless conduct of the Democrat Party.
They're willing to throw away every standard of decency, justice, fairness and due process to get their way. They don't care how they get it. You see it happening before your eyes. I think it's actually an incredible thing that's happening, and I just hope you don't sit home because bad things will happen if you sit home.
So now, the story will be, one wacko. The story will be tomorrow. A major protest greets Donald Trump in the great state of Westminster, one person. He or she I couldn't tell from the back. Let's say it was she, was very easy to get out, right. But this week, America also saw something else. On Thursday, the American people saw the brilliant and really incredible character, quality and courage of our nominee for the United States, Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
True. A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's -- a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time. A jurist with a sterling record of public service - you know, for ten years -- he's a young guy, but for ten years they've been talking about him longer than that. I didn't know him, but I've heard about him a lot because they were all saying he should be on the United States Supreme Court.
That's why I put him up, and -- and I will tell you, I will tell you, I will tell you he has suffered the meanness, the anger. Now, West Virginia, they did a poll, just came out, overall total support for Judge Kavanaugh 58%, total opposed 28%. So it's 58%, 28% oppose, that's pretty good, right? I think that's good.
That's West Virginia. Republican, 81% versus 8%, that we expect. Wow. Women, 52% to 35%. West Virginia, 65% to 21%. That's good, right? It's a poll, but we love those polls. I love polls, only when they're good. When they're not good I don't talk about it. But they do a lot of -- see this, there's the fake news media, they do a lot of -- They do a lot of -- they do a lot phony polls.
They do a lot of phony polls, they do a lot of polls, they call them suppression polls, they make a bad -- Although our polls now are good, they're good because we're doing a lot of good work, but they make them bad, so you go to a movie instead of voting, you say: "Well, you know, Alice, let's go to a movie, then we'll come home and watch the returns." Well, I'll tell you what, in 2016 nobody went to a movie.
Nobody. I think the movie theaters were very empty that night. Don't you think? So, so great things are happening, but a vote for Judge Kavanaugh is also a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democrat Party. Mean obstructionists, mean resistors, for the last 18 months. Democrats have spent every minute trying to overturn the results of the last election.
We had one of the great -- we had one of the great -- every day it's like a job. It's like part of your job description, get up and fight them, get up and fight them. They try and shut down our government. They're holding up 360 men and women who want to work for the government, they're not approving them, and they are highly qualified, and they're not even called nominees, they're not even controversial.
These are people -- it is, you know the word slow walking? They're slow walking. So you have people trying to get in. They've left their jobs and Schumer, and all of the groups that you read about are not allowing these people to come into government, and I'm not even talking about people with a certain view, I'm talking about people that are noncontroversial, including judges, they just go maximum 30 days, 30 days.
If somebody is going to be approved, it has to be approved, they take a -- we're up to 360 people, and it's been that way. The longest in the history of our country, think of it, by far, and the most people in this -- you have the longest and the most people. Honestly, the Democrats are a disgrace, they are, they are a disgrace.
And the number one enabler of the Democrats is the fake news media right back there. And they really do, they stoke the fires of resentment and chaos. They report incorrect news. They report phony news, and you know, when I say -- when I say and come out with very, very strong statements about media, I'm talking about the fake news media.
They are truly an enemy of the people, the fake news, enemy of the people. They really are. They are so bad. You don't even get it. You think like low taxes, you'd think that, like a strong military, no crime, strong borders, they don't, they don't. This November 6, you have a chance to reject these disgraceful political hacks, but you can only do it, you got to vote Republican, I mean, we have good people.
I want to get along with them, but it's impossible in many ways. It's just really tough because they are so far left. They have been taken so far left, where Pocahontas is now considered a conservative in the Democrat Party. She's like a conservative person, Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren, she's considered like a conservative person.
These people are -- they've gone crazy, they've gone loco. We're joined today by many terrific Republican leaders, including a friend of mine, and I have to tell you, Big Jim, he's, the biggest human being, I think, I've ever seen. Big Jim Justice, do we like him? He's our great Governor. Highest -- listen, this is West Virginia, highest ever -- first quarter surplus history of West -- 125 billion above estimate.
Revenue growth by month July up 24.1%, 14.9%, 16.5%, total revenue growth for West Virginia up 18%. Thank you, President Trump, thank you.
I'll be short -- I'll be short and sweet. Nobody can love this man more than I, except you, maybe. What he's done for West Virginia is off-the-chart. Now we've got to step up to the plate. We've got to step up, we've got to deliver him, Patrick Morrissey. We've got deliver him -- we have to deliver him an absolute, solid republican Congress.
Come on now, get behind him. God bless all of you.
Big Jim. That's a big man, and he's doing a great job. He really is. He's doing a great job. But look at these numbers. Hey, Jim, for July up 24.1% revenue growth. Think of that. I'd tell you, look, you people, you know, you are great to me. We won the state by 42 points. You know what 42 points is? And that's -- in all fairness it's not like an independent -- that's against a Democrat.
We won by 42 points. You took me in, you took me in, but I produce, I produce. I produce. These are great people and they love not only the beautiful clean coal. They love lots of other things that we're doing well. West Virginia is back a lot faster than even I thought it could happen. You know it. I get a hug backstage by miners.
These guys are massive guys, they grab me. I say, "How would you like to make computer widgets? "Nope, we want to dig coal." Right. They have no interest in little delicate computer parts. So we also have with us the Secretary of State Mac Warner. Thanks, Mac. Great job. A man who, I hope you can support, because he's been terrific, really did a great job as a congressman, and he's going to the Supreme Court.
He's going to be a justice. Evan Jenkins. Thank you, Evans, got to go and vote for him. A woman that everybody respects, she is running against a total wacko. Now I've seen this person, you can't have that person in Congress. That person is stone-cold crazy. A person that you know very well, and everybody in West Virginia loves Carol Miller.
Carol? Pennsylvania, thanks, guys. Good luck, Carol. I think you're in great shape from what I hear, I hope so. Pennsylvania State Senator Guy Reschenthaler. Guy. Thank you. Thanks, Guy. We're also thrilled to be joined by Ohio Congressman, a friend of mine from day one, he supported Trump when it wasn't his fashionable, right at the beginning.
He didn't go through nine candidates and then say: "Oh, man, finally I'm going to support this guy." We had a couple of them; they never tell me that now. They said: "I supported you from the beginning." This guy really did. Bill Johnson. Right across the water. And Congressman David McKinley. Great job, David.
We like David, right? I like David. Thank you. Thank you, fellas. Also joining us is Brooke County, West Virginia native, a good friend of mine and somebody who truly knows about winning. This guy's a real winner. Coach Lou Holtz. Folks, great guy, he's a great coach, but he's a great guy too. Finally, I'm honored to introduce the person.
We are all here to support the next senator from the great State of West Virginia. Somebody who's going to give us a vote for what we want every single time. There won't be any question about it, Patrick Morrisey. Patrick, please come up, Patrick.
Well, thank you, President Donald Trump. Thank you, Governor Justice. Thanks to this amazing crowd, for this very warm welcome. Now, tell you, this guy really is making America great again, and we know -- we know he's also making West Virginia great again. Now for far too long, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, a Washington liberal Joe Manchin, all of these individuals, and the coastal elites they abandoned are West Virginia values.
They practice political correctness, they advance liberal policies, they didn't put America first. But, fortunately, for all of us, there was one candidate, one man willing to fight back against political correctness and put America first, Donald J. Trump. This election, West Virginia has a very big decision to make.
You could go back to the values of those who abandoned West Virginia, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or Joe Manchin, or you can stand with someone who puts you first, America first, and West Virginia first. The stakes in this election couldn't be higher, and the differences between myself and my opponent, dishonest Washington liberal, Joe Manchin, they couldn't be sharper.
Guys, you have a choice. If you vote for Patrick Morrisey, you will be electing a conservative fighter with a record of results, who will advance the Trump jobs agenda. Vote for dishonest Washington liberal, Joe Manchin, you're gonna be empowering that same group of radical liberal obstructionist, the one you saw in the Senate circus this past week.
Now, now, dishonest Washington liberal Joe Manchin -- Joe's got to go. Amen, brother. Now, dishonest Washington, liberal Joe Manchin has a history of abandoning West Virginia. He abandoned your gun rights, supporting Obama's radical gun control. He abandoned your values on life, backing planned parenthood.
He abandoned your paychecks when he said no to the Trump tax cuts. He abandoned you when he supports amnesty, and when he opposed Trump's border wall. But we're going to build that wall. We're gonna build that wall. But it gets worse, Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after, hang on, even after she made clear, she wanted to take away our coal, our oil, and our gas jobs.
Shame on Joe Manchin. And that's why liberal Joe's gotta go. Now, when I'm in the Senate, we're going to have a different approach. We're going to put West Virginia first. We're going to fight against all those unlawful and illegal regulations that hold that job creators. Like the one I defeated as your attorney general and the ones that President Trump is withdrawing.
We're going to -- we're going to ignite the economy even more, we'll supercharge West Virginia. We'll make the Trump tax cuts permanent, and we're going to re-empower the people of The State of West Virginia with term limits to hold Washington politicians accountable. We'll stop the funding of Planned Parenthood and we'll take -- yeah, we will.
And we're going to take back our West Virginia values and end the grunt grabs by the Liberals in Washington. And not insignificantly, we'll all stand for the national anthem. But I need your help. We're getting a lot of support from President Trump, in fact, because of his last trip, we're basically even in the polls, but we have a lot more work to do against the wily ways of these Washington politicians.
I need you to get involved. I need you to volunteer. I need you to go online, at patrickmorrisey.com and donate and help me close the gap against the liberal ATM machine of Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin. This race will likely decide the balance of power in the Senate, amen, brother, but remember those radicals in Washington, Schumer, Pelosi, Maxine Waters, and Joe Manchin, ooh, yes, they don't want to see our President succeed.
They want to obstruct just like they did this week against Judge Kavanaugh. Ladies and gentlemen, we must confirm, Judge Kavanaugh. It's time to join our team today, because Joe's got to go. He's got to go. It's my honor to stand with President Trump to fight for you. We, unlike Joe Manchin, Hillary Clinton, and the radical liberals, will never abandon our American and our West Virginia values.
and the one thing you will know is that, together, this team, we're going to continue making America great again, and we'll make West Virginia great again. Thank you very much. God bless you.
Thank you, wow. Good job, Patrick. Thank you Patrick. Remember this, a vote for Patrick Morrissey is a vote to stand up for West Virginia values, right. A vote for Morrisey is a vote for me and for our agenda to make America great again or, as we will soon start saying, keep America great, right?
Keep America. Keep America great. That will be our new theme very soon. I don't -- I don't want to switch yet, we're not even into two years, right? Make America Great Again. I can't use it in 2020. We can't because, by that time, if we go even like half of what we've done so we're going to have the new and Keep America Great it's a very important election.
It will decide which party controls the United States Senate. A Democrat, controlled Senate will try to take away your Second Amendment, they're, going to take it away. They want to takeover American healthcare and destroy it. They want to make us Venezuela, that's what they want to do. You'll have Venezuela, a big version, erase America's borders.
You know we fight for borders, but we -- hey, by the way, see the signs? "Finish the wall." That's a good -- Finish the wall. We are in the process. It's got another billion six, I want to get more, but it's coming. It's coming. We've built a lot of wall already and fixed a lot of wall, but we get that. It's not the easiest thing, because the Democrats know it's a thing we really want.
It's very much of a signature, it's very big part of what we talked about. They get in the way. I know it for a fact. They said, we can't. We'll get things that are actually military, 700 billion and 716 billion, we get that. A wall is a tiny thing by comparison, but they want to fight that wall for political purposes, but we're building it. And I love the signs "Finish it.", we'll get it finished.
They want to kill and this will happen, as sure as you're standing or sitting, I don't know who has a better seat. you are you? I mean, this is a guarantee. Your coal mines and your miners are working. They will kill West Virginia coal, that's a guarantee. And they want to turn our federal courts into the political arm of the Democrat resistance.
You see it, you see it. Now, Joe Manchin voted, no on tax cuts for American families. He just voted no. What are you going to say? He voted no on removing Obama's job killing regulations. By the way, we've got more regulation, that's why you have all these jobs, record-setting jobs, more regulations than any President ever in the history of our country.
That's pretty good. That's pretty good. And we haven't been there for two years, but time is flying, isn't it? Time is flying, but we've cut more than any administration whether it was four years, eight years, or in one case much more than that. We've cut more Joe, also voted. No on repealing and replacing Obamacare, which we almost had done but I'll be nice now, we couldn't get a single Democrat vote.
If we did, we would have killed it. We would have had great healthcare, but we're giving you a lot of great healthcare anyway. If you look at the plans, we're coming out with a great -- and we got rid of the individual mandate, the worst part of Obamacare. And Joe voted yes on something that not too many people in this room like, mass amnesty, mass amnesty.
Joe refuse to stand up to the Democrat resistance, the radical open border dams. Pelosi and their new de facto leader, the legendary Maxine Waters. The Democrat Party will stop at nothing to run your lives, run down your values and ransack our nation's wealth. We've never done like this. They will turn it around, make it bad so fast getting money for the military was so tough, and to do that, we had to give them money for things that we don't want.
We would never want, but now we have our military rebuilding, we've taken care of our military. We've got a massive number of fighter jets and rockets and missiles; we make the greatest military equipment in the world. We have ordered so much that other countries look at us and they say: "Ahh, let's forget about them." That's what we want.
We don't want wars. But the only way you don't have wars. If you have a military, that's what we're doing we're in the process of building the strongest military we've ever had by far. The new platform of the Democrat Party. You notice I say Democrat Party? I hate the way it sounds that's why I say it because it's really their name, you know.
It's not the Democratic Party that doesn't sound it flows nicer. The Democratic Party, but you know, the real name is the Democrat Party. I hate the way it sounds and that's why I use it, but it's still a real name. The Democrat Party -- so when you see Democratic Party, it's wrong. There's no name Democratic Party, that's a great name.
They should probably change the name, if you think about it. Then I'd call them The Democratic Party. The Democrat Party is radical socialism, Venezuela, and open borders. It's now called, to me -- you've never heard this before, The Party of Crime. It's a Party of Crime, it's what it is. And to pay for their socialism, which is going to destroy our country.
Democrats want to raid Medicare and destroy Social Security. So, what's going to happen? Democrats want to completely destroy Medicare with so-called Medicare for all. Yeah, for about two months before the country goes out of business. Robbing our seniors of the benefits they paid into for their entire lives, giving it to people that don't deserve it. Giving it, by the way, to illegal aliens who come into our country.
Republicans want to protect Medicare for our great seniors, who have earned it and paid for it, and I will always fight for, and always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. You have to do it. You have to do it. some people think that's not a Republican thing to do. I don't care. And I'll tell you what, all of the Republicans are coming into that position now, all of them, and we'll do it the right way.
Pre-existing conditions are safe. OK, just remember that. Pre-existing -- tell that to the fake news media when they write. Fakers. The Fakers. But we all have a good time. You know they can all endorsed me for the next election, have you heard? Because if they don't and if for some reason I didn't win, every single media outlet goes bankrupt.
Can you imagine? Can you imagine if they had to cover Crazy Bernie, who the hell is going to watch? Or any of them? How about Cory Booker did you watch the performance? He ran in Newark New Jersey into the ground and now he wants to be president, right? What was the moment he said he had? I don't think so. I think we take Kirk Douglas in his prime.
Do we agree? I think we did. No, he ran Newark into the ground, now he's out there acting, "Oh, it's so wonderful, great. Oh, I dream of these people every night. The only thing I worry about is that some total unknown that nobody ever heard of comes along, but you know what, honestly, with what we've done on jobs on our country and our military, we're going to talk about our veterans what we've done.
Look, in your case, energy, energy, look what we've done in energy with every -- Who the hell can beat us? I mean, who can beat us? Who can beat us? One of these people said recently, and they hated to say it, but the Trump has actually fulfilled more promises than he promised. It's true. Look what we're doing.
4.2% GDP, every point is $3.5 trillion dollars and 10 million jobs. And when I took it over, our country was headed south we were going down, we were going down, you'd be, instead of 4.2%, you'd be at 4.2% negative, negative 4.2% That's the way we were headed. Perhaps nothing is more dangerous than the Democrats push to abolish, very brave people that work for us, and they love us and take care of us called ICE.
They want to abolish immigration enforcement entirely and they want no borders, they want no borders, let everybody just flow into our country. And he got some bad dudes coming in, but they're not coming in with us. We have set records on arrests at the borders. Nobody even close, and that's without the wall in those sections where we haven't been able to get the money because the Democrats won't approve.
You have to understand, we have very small margins. You know they say we're the majority. The majority by what? If somebody has a cold, we can't take a vote. If you have a cold, if somebody is not feeling well, we say: "Let's delay the vote for three days." We don't have a major -- it's so close. It's so close.
That's why we have to get more Republicans in. We will do something that nobody has ever seen before. The Democrat Party supports, totally, they love them sanctuary cities where crime pours in and they protect her. That unleash violent predators like MS-13 into American communities, leaving innocent Americans at the mercy of really, by the way, really ruthless animals, really ruthless animals Nancy Pelosi said, "How dare he call a human being an animal?" I'm sorry Nancy.
These are the words, they're don't like guns, they like to use knives because it's more painful and it takes a long time. These are real bad people and we're bringing them out so fast. And you know who's doing it? Who's leading the charge, who loves doing it? ICE. Who the hell wants that job? ICE. ICE is doing the job, right?
Right. ICE is doing that job. These are brave people. They go into towns in Long Island, where I grew up, right next to these places, I know them all. They used to be, you'd leave your door open, you'd, leave your window open. You go to sleep, nobody thinks. Now you -- it's like a fort, but not anymore.
What's happened, is they go in like they're, liberating a country. It's like this is the United States, and ICE goes in and MS-13 they're afraid of ICE. You know why, because ICE is much tougher than they are, that's all they fear. And they go in and they grab them by the necks and they throw them the hell into a paddy wagon and they take them either to jail, and throw them the hell out of the country, it's very simple.
It's very simple. And they cleaned out towns, they cleaned out towns of truly bad people, dangerous people. You saw what happened, I got to know mothers that have daughters, fathers that have daughters. In many cases, daughters, and in many cases, sons, but what they do to these incredible kids, walking home from school, going home with books to study and do homework and they intercept them and they're -- they're horrible, it's horrible and we're getting them out.
But we have to re -- the Democrats. It's like, it's like, they don't even understand that there's a problem, it's incredible. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. So Republicans, not Democrats, they want to end ICE, they want to end a lot of things.
Open borders. Can you believe it? How would you like this platform? We want open borders. We want high taxes, we want crime because basically, they're saying crime, so to have crime, they have high taxes, they have open borders. Oh, and by the way - and we don't want to fund the military. You have no idea how hard it is to get money from for the military, it's almost impossible.
That was like a full- time job, but we got that money. We got a lot of buyers. In the Democrats, got 51 votes in the Senate. They would open our nation's borders. They would starve our law enforcement, they would starve our great law -- Do we love our law enforcement? Seriously. I've got a tremendous percentage of law enforcement vote, but you know, I think, I might have -- Do I get 100%. Let's say I didn't. Who the hell wouldn't vote for me from law enforcement?
OK, we've done a lot. We've gotten a lot of surplus material from the military. You know, we had all this -- We had hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus material, and our previous administration, under no circumstances did they want to give this to law enforcement, because you know it's great equipment.
It keeps the law enforcement safe, like trucks that are armored and things like that, so they didn't want to give it because they thought it presented a wrong image. I gave it, it's all out, they're all happy. We had a military, we had a sitting in storage rooms all over the country, getting old and probably costing us a lot of money.
We gave it out to law enforcement and law enforcement does like us. If you want to secure our border. If you want to stop sanctuary cities, which even in California now. They don't want to be sanctuary cities anymore, they want out. You see it. They're rebelling in California, of all places, they're rebelling.
If you want to protect American communities from really bad bad crime, then you need to vote Republican, Patrick Larson. Gotta vote Republican. This election is about security, and it's about prosperity. Here are just some of our extraordinary achievements. We've done things that nobody can believe. If I would have used these numbers during the campaign, the fake news would've said: "Oh, it's so ridiculous, it's so ridiculous." "How can he say that." I used much lower numbers than they said that.
Economic growth last quarter was 4.1%, and it was just adjusted upward 4.2%, and it's going much -- it's going higher, folks. It's going a lot higher. Jobless claims. That's a beauty. Jobless. Think of that. Jobless claims just fell to a nearly 50-year low. Is that good? That's good, right? We've created over 4 million new jobs since the election, four million.
Nobody would have said. If I would have said, "Hey, we're going to create in less than two years, they would have said, "You've got to be kidding." We've list -- Look at this. We've lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Wow. Pretty bad, huh. Now, No.1, we're taking care of people. No. 2, it doesn't cost us anything.
I mean, that four million people that's a lot of money at cause. We've added, nearly, it will soon be 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. We weren't supposed to be adding jobs. We weren't supposed to be adding manufacturing jobs. And I'll tell you what. The most incredible of everything is, we are doing things with manufacturing.
Companies are pouring back into our country and they're coming back into your state. They're, going to Michigan, they're going to Ohio, right here, they're going to Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and South Carolina. I was with the Prime Minister Abe of Japan. He's got many companies moving in, I said: "Look, we have a big deficit with you, we take care of your military and we have a deficit." What's going on? He said, "We are moving many companies into the United States.
And he is. And he's been. And many cou -- If you look, just take a look. Many countries are doing that because I don't like having deficits with every country. And China, we're taking them on very strongly. First time ever. Very Strongly. And they either open it up to make it fair and don't charge us what they're doing, because that's no good, or we just don't do business with them, it's a very simple thing.
And in four months they've gone way down and I don't want them to go way down. I have great respect for President Xi and I have great respect for China, but they have not treated as well. We lost over the years $500 billion, we'd go $250 billion, $300 billion, $400 billion, $500 billion, $525 billion. We rebuild China.
How stupid are we? No, h0w stupid are we. We build a car and we send it to China and they charge a tariff for a tax of 25%. They build a car and they send it to the U.S and it's two and a half percent, but we don't charge them. They don't have to pay, and I said, "Why don't they have to pay at least a two and a half?" Nobody could tell me why.
Nobody so think of it. They charge us 25%, right? We charge them nothing. Other than that, it's a very fair deal. Now, how stupid is -- how stupid is it? So the stupid days are over, folks, I'm sorry. I mean, I love Saudi Arabia. They're great. King Salman, I talked to him this morning, a long talk. And I said to him, "King, you've got trillions of dollars, without us Who knows what going to happen?
Maybe you're not going to be able to keep those airplanes, because you know what? They'd be attacked. With us, they are like, you know, safe, totally safe. But we don't get what we should be getting we're subsidizing their military. So let me ask you a question: "Why are we subsidizing the military of these really wealthy--" You know, one thing where countries are in deep trouble and danger, and it's a horrible thing going on, and it could be something really ugly and you know hundreds of thousands, millions of people could be killed, that's one thing.
But when you have wealthy countries like Saudi Arabia like Japan, like South Korea, why are we subsidizing that military? They'll pay us. The problem is nobody ever asked. Nobody ever asked. They don't ask. I mean, with South Korea we're paying about 60% of their military costs. They'd buy a missile system -- Oh, by the way, we're doing great with North Korea.
I have just told you. We're doing -- You know these dishonest people back there. So I left. What did I do? Was there like, three months ago. So for 80 years, they've been working on this stuff, and for twenty five years they've been working on missiles and nuclear. They got nowhere. They wouldn't even answer our President's phone calls when they called they told them, "Don't call us." And yes, I agree.
The rhetoric was unbelievably harsh at the beginning, but we have a very good relationship. We were going to war with North Korea. That was what was going to happen. Millions of people would have been killed. President Obama told me when I sat just before taking office. He said the single biggest problem this country has is North Korea.
And he said he was, you know, very close to going to war, but fortunately his time was up. That his time is up. He would have been in a war. Millions of people would have been killed. I mean, you have sold 30 million people right off the border 30 miles away. Millions of people would have been -- and yes, I came in and took a very hard position, very hard position.
And you know what now we have this great relationship and let's see what happens, let's see what happens let's see what happens, but if you think, so the fakers are saying like, they don't know what to do? I got the hostages back for nothing. Obama paid $1.8 billion. You know I got it back for nothing, right?
We got the remains of our great heroes back for many, many years. You don't have any more nuclear testing, in fact, they're closing up a lot of the sites. You don't have rockets going up, you don't have missiles going up and you have people -- I like him. He likes me. I guess that's OK, am I allowed to say that?
Am I allowed to say? We've come a long way since you know the term, right? We've come a long way, but we could have been in something. Now I'm not saying, what's going to happen? Who knows. Are we going to have another meeting? Chairman Kim would like to have another meeting. We have a meeting. You know they did?
The other day on a good network or head -- ne of the anchors say: "Why has President Trump given up so much?" I didn't give up anything. Really. I didn't give up anything. What did I give up? I gave up nothing. Why have I give it up -- The only thing that I gave up was I agreed to meet. Boy why we lost a lot, right?
In the other words I agreed to meet. I gave up nothing they are just faker's. They don't know what to do. It's driving them crazy, they're, loco, it's driving them crazy. We gave up so much. Now Obama, with the Iran deal, gave them $150 billion dollars and gave $1.8 billion in cash, in cash, in cash. You know how much money that is? And nobody said he gave up too much, except me. That's why I ended the deal.
OK. I ended it. I gave it to him in cash. You see like with a promotion we have a hundred dollar bills. You have a million dollars. It's like twice the size of this thing. That's for a million bucks in a hundred dollar bills, right. It's twice the size of the podium, like exactly twice the size. Can you imagine $1.8 billion.
Where the hell do you get $1.8 billion in cash? And don't let anyone tell you it wasn't for the hostages unless he had something or maybe he did have something else in mind. So we are doing great. That was a big, big problem. And you know the interesting? When I did it and I was really being tough, and so was he. I would go back and forth and then we fell in love.
OK, no really. He wrote me beautiful letters and had great letters. We fell in love, but you know what now they'll make us sick. "Donald Trump said, they fell in love, how horrible? How horrible is that?" So unpresidential. and I always tell you it's so easy to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right there.
OK, it's so easy to be Presidential. All I have to do is thank you very much for being here, ladies and gentlemen. It's great to see you. You're great Americans. Thousand points of light, which nobody has really figured out, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, hasn't that been exciting? How is West Virginia?
And in the meantime, everything seems to be dying. You're cold and everything else. No, no we've got to keep it going the way it's going. Do we agree? Do we agree? Get Patrick in there. We got to keep it going because we have something going that nobody's ever seen before. You know every foreign leader that comes to see me in the White House, which I see a lot but every foreign lead -- and I see a lot because usually they're treating us unfairly with military, meaning, we're paying for their military and I'm saying.
Why? Because we're we doing all of that. We're not going to do it. I said: "Saudi Arabia, you're rich you've got to pay for your military." We'll take care of -- We'll be good. You've got to pay for your military. Sorry, nobody ever asked the question. And I have generals, you know it's called the military industrial complex.
They're great people, they're warriors but they're not into the world of finance, so I say, General, how much are they paying for this? He say, "Sir, we are paying for it." "Why?" "Sir, we're paying, because they are our allies?" I said, "Yeah, but why else?" "Sir, trade." I said, "Yeah, we lost $100 billion last year on trade with this.
Why are we doing this?" And people slowly but surely, I'm telling you, big difference. And you see GDP number's now at 4.2%. When we straighten out these horrible trade deals -- these horrible military deals that we have, forget it. Off the charts. Household income, among Hispanic-Americans, has just set a new record-high, think of that.
Income. Since my election, and you've heard this many times, I'm very proud of it, because I used to go around saying what you have to lose vote for me instead of a Democrat, right? Vote for me, African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-America unemployment have all reached the lowest levels ever recorded in our history, right?
The poverty rates for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. It's been incredible. They've all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country. Think of it. Now who the hell is going to beat me? I mean, I'm saying African-Americans have the lowest unemployment rate in history. Why would somebody do well?
I think, and we have Kanye West. We have a lot of support. Big Jim Brown, How about Big Jim Brown? How good was he? If he was playing today, he'd make a trillion dollars and he'd stand for the flag too, I'd tell you. I know him. Great. Unemployment for Americans without high-school diplomas. That's a big thing.
Recently reached the lowest rate ever recorded. The women's unemployment rate in the United States recently reached its lowest rate in over 65 years. This is something that is personal to you and some other states. We repeal President Obama's federal coal moratorium. We ended the cold, crushing stream protection rule which was killing you, it sounded so beautiful.
The EPA, so-called a killer. Clean power plan, it was a killer. It was costing this country a fortune. It was a total killer. Has such nice names such a nice title? It put everybody out of business and it took away our strength, it took away our wealth and I withdrew the United States from the job killing, very unfair and very, very expensive Paris climate accord, another one that -- A killer.
These are killers. They were putting our country out of business. We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal and in just the last year, our coal exports have skyrocketed. This is exports to other countries by 66%. You believe that? The United States is now the No. 1 energy producer in the world. That happened just recently.
A lot of money in that. We're fixing the one sided trade deals that have stolen American jobs, drained American wealth. It's been a massive transfer of wealth, out of our country, we're bringing it all back. They're all coming back. We've reached the deal to replace the horrible NAFTA. One of the worst trade deals ever.
With a brand new U.S-Mexico trade deal, and we'll see what happens with Canada, if they come along, good. They have to --they have to be fair. They have -- right now, they have tariffs over 300% on dairy products. That's like a barrier. They have to be fair, but we've made the deal with Mexico and it's a great deal for both countries.
NAFTA was the worst deal. Just this week, I signed a groundbreaking new trade deal with South Korea that will dramatically increase exports of American made goods. I said, "You got to open up your country. Now the Democrats will look at any of these deals." They won't read them, they won't know anything about them.
They'll just say, "I guess I'd do it. If I was tempt to." They'll say, What do you think of that? "It's no good, it's terrible." "Oh, have you read it?" "Don't ask me that question" These deals are unbelievable. These deals are so good for us. You're not going to have companies leaving our country, firing everybody and then selling their product back into the United States with no taxes.
Not going to happen anymore. And thanks to our very strong position on tariffs, because I want them to negotiate with us. We've saved American aluminum and American steel companies they are thriving. American steel is building plants all over the country, steel workers are back and the miners are supplying the metallurgic coal.
We don't need foreign steel, what happens if we're in a conflict? What are we going to do? Get our steel from some foreign country? Oh, by the way we have -- we need steel, we need aluminum. There are certain things you need and we're hiring a lot of people, and you know what? Our treasury is getting loaded up with money, because billions of dollars will be flowing in because we charge 25% when they dump.
You know, when they dump steel? What they want to do is put our steel companies out of business, then they sell us steel at prices that are so high, nobody wants to talk about that. Nobody wants to talk about the jobs created, and nobody wants to talk about all the money that's flowing in to the coffers of the United States of America.
They don't like to talk about it. And the people that are against it are usually having con -- you know, you go to these other countries, they have companies there too, and many of these people, "Well, we like free trade." So I'll say even to congressmen and senators, "Let me ask you a question." So we have a country take India, good relationship.
They want to make a deal now because they don't want me to do what I'm going if I have to. So they call us they didn't want to make a deal with anybody else. So take India, so you're talking about free trade. So let's say they charge us 60% tariff on a product and for the same products when they send it in we charge them nothing.
So now I want to charge them 25%, or 20%, or 10% or something. What do you think? "That's not free trade. We don't like it." I said, "Where are these people coming from?" No, think of it. Where are they coming from, and you have no idea how difficult it is? Where are they coming -- so India just uses as an example, I could give you others that are brutal.
Just brutal what they do to us, how they take advantage of the stupidity. We never even had people negotiating, they just do whatever they want, but take India. So they charge you 60%, right, 60%. We charge them nothing, and when I say I'm going to put a 25% tariff on just to make it a little bit fair. They say, "That's not free trade." I said, "What -- what do you -- where you come from?" Remember this, a lot of the people that are fighting me and what I'm doing have ownership of companies in these other countries.
Remember that, please. Remember that. Or they're represented by lobbies, so the steel people love me. The coal people love me. Many people love me. You know who loves me? Our country has never done better. That's who loves me. Crazy. So to give our workers and businesses, just on finishing up. A level playing field Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.
We pass something else that I love, right to try. You know the right to try is? That's where somebody is terminally ill. We have a pipeline of some of the greatest products and we couldn't get up, we couldn't use them. A person's going to die in four months, we couldn't use them. For 45 years, I've been trying to get this passed.
Not that easy, not that easy. I got to pass. Yeah, right to try. Somebody is terminally ill. They can take now -- they have to sign that clause in things and they -- Now, don't have to travel to parts of the world. We passed veterans choice, giving us Veterans Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor if they're standing in line for four weeks, right.
They couldn't get it passed. This has been going on for 45 years. They couldn't get it passed. Veterans are greatest people. These are people -- Any veterans here? Veterans? It was very tough, 45years they couldn't, we got it passed. So now, instead of waiting on line for three weeks and dying, in many cases believe it or not, they start of they're, OK, they wait so long to see a doctor, they end up becoming terminal, they end up dying.
They now go out and see a doctor. We pay the bill, it's great. Passed. We passed. We also passed the landmark V.A. Accountability Act, so that all these bad players that were in the V.A we fire them so fast. When that bad, you didn't have the right to fire anybody, they could do anything. I just signed legislation to completely, completely rebuild all of our military.
And I told you about that, and you know what, it's so important to me, so important to me, so important. We have tanks, we have ships, we have everything, so important. And at my direction at the Pentagon is working right now, as we speak, to create a sixth branch of the United States, Armed Forces called the Space Force, right?
I went through the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran deal. and Iran is not the same country right now, folks. And they better not do nuclear, they better not. That same country, we've all recognized the true capital of Israel. Recently, when I opened the American embassy in Jerusalem, and I've just come from a tremendously successful trip, I've done a lot of trips from the United Nations to Saudi Arabia, to China, to UK, European Union all over the world, and every one of those means a lot of jobs that a lot of income coming into our country that nobody ever did before, nobody ever did it. I made clear that we will never sacrifice America's sovereignty to unelected, unaccountable foreign bureaucrats.
I'm not going to do it. We reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace that doctrine -- you know what I'm saying? The doctrine of -- Let's put it this way, we love our country, that's our doctrine. You can call it patriotism, but it's really the doctrine of we love our country. For years you watch as your leaders apologize for America.
Now you have a President who is standing up for America. We are standing up for your values. We are standing up for West Virginia. We are standing proudly for our national anthem to continue our momentum, to protect your family, and your borders, your constitution and your country. You need to get your friends, get your family, get your co-workers and get out and vote for Patrick Morrisey, get out and vote Republican.
And if you are registered, to register right now, you've got to register here, and the deadline to register is October 16. Hate to break this by saying that, but those are the facts. Register. October 16. Loyal citizens like you, helped build this country and together, and together we are taking back our country and returning power to where it belongs to the American people.
This great state was built by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women. These brave West Virginia patriots ventured out into the wilderness and up into the mountains to build a beautiful home, a life and a dream. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common: They love their families, they love their country and they love their god.
True. True. We stand on the shoulders of these courageous Americans. Your ancestors did not pour out their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home, while others try to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage. That's what the Democrats are trying to do with their crazy policies.
Just like the pioneers and patriots who came before us. We are going to work, we're going to fight and we're going to win for our families, for our flag, and for our freedom. The revolution that you began in 2016 and it was the revolution, and even these people will admit that that was a revolution like they've never seen before.
That was a revolution that was -- they came from the hills and they came from the valleys, they came from everywhere. And at the end of that evening, they said, "Hate to tell you this. A lot of bad things are happening tonight for the Democrats." That was one of the great evenings, not because of me, but because of you.
That was one of the great evenings in the history of our country. And it's far from over. It's only just beginning, we will not bend, we will not break, we will never give in. We will never give up, we will never back down, we will never surrender and we will always fight on to victory, victory, victory.
Because we are America, and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, West Virginia. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm thrilled to be back in the state that gave us American independence... [Applause] American steel, which is coming back very strongly [Applause] and generations of hard-working American patriots just like you. It's great to be here. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
We live in a truly incredible country and this is an incredible time. You see what's happening? We are respected again. We are respected again. Our economy is soaring, our jobs are booming, factories are pouring back into our country. They're coming from all over the world. We're defending our workers. We're protecting our Constitution.
We're crushing the terrorists. We're taking care of our vets. We love our vets. Love our vets. Our military is stronger than ever before, $700 billion. And the forgotten men and women of the United States are forgotten no more.
So, I just watched last night our great vice president, Mike Pence. He traveled all the way to Hawaii, 12 hours -- said that was OK; it wouldn't've mattered if it was 50 hours -- to meet the remains and greet the families of the American heroes who gave their lives in Korea. [Audience Chants USA]
Our fallen warriors are finally coming home to lay at rest in American soil. A long time. It's been a long time.
We are honored to be joined tonight by your state's Republican nominee for governor. A great guy, somebody I know well. He is going to be one hell of a governor. He's tough. He's smart. Scott Wagner. Scott! And I also want to recognize your terrific Republican candidates for Congress, John Shren [Applause] Dan Moser [Applause] John Joyce, and a man that was there right from the beginning.
He heard I was going to be running. He said, "You've got to go with Trump." A man named Tom Marino, and he was a good friend and is a good friend of Lou. They love each other. Tom Marino right from the beginning. I also want to thank Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Val DiGiorgio. Val, thank you. And David, thank you, and all of those people. David, you do some job on television, I want to tell you, David.
And we did a great job. You know, Pennsylvania, for years and years they talked about Pennsylvania will be won by the Republicans, right? It always got away. Nobody knew what happened. It always got away. But we won the state of Pennsylvania, you remember? Remember? Remember that incredible night in November. Remember that incredible night?
And you remember that we were way up in Pennsylvania and there was only 2 percent of the vote left. And we were way up. If I lost every vote, we would've won the state of Pennsylvania. And the fake news refused to call it, right? They refused to call it. [Audience Boos]
We waited for hours. We were at 98 percent. I said, "What's going on? I want to win with the state of Pennsylvania." And then some interesting things happened before they called. They just refused. They said, "Donald Trump has won the great state of Wisconsin." Right? They said, "Donald Trump has won, for the first time in many years, both of them, the great state of Michigan," and you people didn't get the privilege of taking us over the top. Next time. Next time.
They wouldn't call it. I kept saying, "Why aren't they calling Pennsylvania?" Remember, an hour, two hours, so long, 98 percent and they wouldn't call it. Well, they were suffering that night. That was suffering.
I remember a nice man -- I actually like him. He's very talented -- with a big chart, and all that red -- it started getting red Republican. It started getting red. That chart red, red, red. The little -- little tiny dot of blue along the ocean. [Laughter]
Little blue over here around the Los Angeles area, that whole thing was red. And he's going, "Ohh," his hands start shaking. "Look, oh my God, another state came. Oh my God, what's this?" Fake news!
You know what you call them, right? Suppression polls, right? Suppression. They give you phony polls so that you say, "You know what darling? We have an election tonight. But Trump won't win because the polls are so bad. But let's go to a movie and then we'll come home and we'll watch his defeat."
There's only one problem: Nobody believed them and everybody went out to vote. Right? Everybody went out. And they turned on the television and they said, "Darling, he's winning. Look, he just won Florida, just won North Carolina. He just won South Carolina." We had -- that was something. Was that an exciting night?
That was an excite -- one of the world's most. You know, they kept saying, "The state of Texas," which I thought -- every rally I went to was like this. And by the way, you think this is a big crowd? Go outside and take a look. Go outside.
But I kept -- I'd go to Texas, and I said, "Boy, are we popular in Texas." [Audience Boos, Protestor Disruption] All right, get him out. Get him out. Get him out of here! [Audience Boos, Chants USA]
So, getting back to Texas -- so for two and a half months, I hear "Texas is in play." That means it's so close that it's going to be all night long before we find out who wins the state of Texas. And I couldn't understand it. And they said, "Utah is in play." I couldn't understand it. Go to Utah. Great people, incredible people.
And then we come to election night. Now, I figured it's going to be close in Texas because I believed those people. No longer. But I believed. [Audience Boos] So it hits 8 o'clock, and they go, like, two seconds after 8:00. "Donald Trump has won the state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Utah." And we won by so much.
And I said to my people, somewhat innocently, "What was that all about?" They said, "Sir, it's suppression. If they convince people through the polls, people don't go out to vote." But I really mean it, our people went out to vote. And no better instance than the state of Pennsylvania. No better.
And I want to introduce a very special man, because he's been a friend of mine from the beginning. He's been with me. He said, "You're going to win. You're going to win." He's a great political person. He's a leader. He's running against somebody who's so overrated. I mean, this guy -- you know, I was telling a little story on Bob Casey. I've been there. [Audience Boos]
I've been -- I have to do this before we introduce Lou. [Audience Calls Out "Lou"] So I've been in Washington now for more than a year and a half. I hardly -- I mean, honestly, I'm not sure I ever met Bob Casey. I've never met him. And I'm sure I did. I shook his hand. But I'm not sure.
Now, his father was a good man; knew him a little bit. But we're dealing with a totally different person. I don't think -- I don't know this man. He's a senator. They're a hundred senators. I don't know him. [Audience Members Calls Out "Obstructionist"]
No, he's not an obstructionist. He's worse. He will do whatever Schumer, Pelosi and the new star... [Audience Boos] and the new star of the Democrat Party tells him to do. You know who the new star? You know who that new leader is? Maxine Waters. [Audience Boos] Very low IQ low. Low IQ. No, no Maxine Waters is like -- she's like their new star.
But I want to introduce somebody that really is a star. He's smart. He's strong. He loves this state. People are just starting to know him, but I've known him for a long time. And you know, when he wants something for Pennsylvania, he is brutal. He's brutal. So if you would, Lou Barletta, please come out. Lou Barletta. Lou Barletta.
Thank you. Thank you. This is amazing. This is just amazing. I never, ever thought in my life that I would ever become a politician. I never thought that I would become a mayor. I never thought that I would become a congressman. But never in my wildest dreams did I ever believe that the president of the United States would come to my home area to help me win an election for the United States Senate.
Thank you. Thank you. I'm grateful and humbled by that. You know, the economy is soaring under President Trump's economy. It is soaring.
The market -- the market is up over 20 percent. Unemployment's at 4 percent. Black unemployment's at an all-time low. Hispanic unemployment's at an all-time low. Women's unemployment's at an all-time low. Small-business confidence is an all-time high. Consumer confidence is at an all-time high. There are more jobs now than people who are unemployed.
ISIS -- ISIS is practically gone. North Korea's at the table. The wall is being built. Why would we ever stop that? We're not tired of winning, Mr. President. We're not tired of winning. [Audience Calls Out "Lou"]
But I want to tell you who wants to stop that. Bob Casey wants to stop that. He has become one of the most liberal senators in Washington. [Audience Boos] He is leading the resistance and obstruction to President Trump's agenda. He is so radical. He is so radical now, that he said no to no matter who President Trump nominated for the Supreme Court. It didn't matter. He said no before he even mentioned who it was.
He gave us Obamacare. He supports sanctuary cities. He wants to take -- take away your tax cuts. [Audience Boos] He no longer represents the values of people here in Pennsylvania.
Now listen: This seat is very important. It's very important because we want to keep that economy going. We want to -- we want to once again show our law enforcement and first responders the respect they deserve.
We want to -- we want to take care of our vets. We want to honor our military. We want to secure our borders. We want to put an end to illegal immigration once and for all.
And we want to -- and we want to take a knee to play and stand for the flag. So I need everybody here. I need everybody here and everybody watching to help, help me help President Trump drain the swamp and make America great again. Thank you! [Applause, Audience Calls Out "Lou"]
He did a good job. So long, folks. What do I have to do? Bye. [Laughter] So, Lou -- you don't Lou, some people. They don't know him well. I've known him well for a long time.
All I had to do -- I wanted him to get this position to run. I said, "All I have to do is introduce Lou Barletta to the public a little bit," because he's known in his area, his district, he's like a legend. He was a great mayor, a great congressman.
But the state didn't know him really as much. And tonight, they all know him. This guy is a dynamo. He's incredible. And I have to say you're dealing, on the other side, with the exact opposite. Lou mentioned some of the things, but when you think about Justice Gorsuch, you don't do better than that. You don't do better than that.
And Casey voted against him. And now we have somebody that's extraordinary, as you know, Judge Kavanaugh. Yale College, Yale Law School, top, top student, top of everything. They predicted 15 years ago, when he was with a lot of other talented people, someday he'd be a Supreme Court judge.
And you know what? I think Casey doesn't even want to meet with him. You know why? 'Cause Schumer, Pelosi and Maxine Waters told him not to meet. [Audience Boos] So he was no, and probably will be no. And maybe after tonight he'll vote yes, but I doubt it. Because his bosses are telling him what to do.
And they always have; not the father but the son, yes. So they have no on Kavanaugh, no on Gorsuch, no on massive tax cuts. In fact, Casey and the group, they want to end the tax cuts and increase your taxes. Somehow that doesn't play well. Somehow. [Audience Boos]
Somehow that doesn't play too well. And you know what else he was no on? The biggest thing that only really the business people in this room fully appreciate, he was no on regulation cutting.
We had regulations that made it impossible to do business in this country. Highways would take 21 years to get approved. We have it down to two years, and it's going to be one year very shortly. Very shortly.
And you know what? We want clean, beautiful water. We want crystal clear air. We want our air to be the best. It is; right now, it's the best it's ever been.
But you don't have to go through 97 different approvals over a 20-year period. And we may reject plenty, but we're going to reject them in a year and they can go on to do something else. We're not going to take them down the line 20, 21 years and then you have a 3-to-2 vote against the project where people work their entire lives to get it approved. So we've gotten rid of massive amounts of regulation.
Bob Casey. Bob Casey was joining President Obama... [Audience Boos] and his horrible attacks on our clean coal industry. Bob Casey was making it absolutely impossible for the miners. And Lou Barletta was fighting on behalf of our miners, our mines, our companies, and our beautiful Pennsylvania clean coal. And Lou won, and so did I, and so did you.
So now with Lou on our side, we've won that war on coal and we're doing something else, because we're putting these great miners -- these are great people. You know, in West Virginia, great mines, great people. I went -- I said to the miners, "You remember when Hillary Clinton said 'We're going to close you up'?" Then she had to go down to Pennsyl -- right? Then she had to come to Pennsylvania. [Audience Boos, Chants Lock Her Up]
No, no, no, no. They only want to hurt Republicans. They don't want to do anything. But you know what? It's all changing folks. It's all changing. Some things just take a little bit longer.
They only want to go after Republicans. You look at the kind of criminal actions and crime, they only want to go after the Republicans. But Lou wants to put our miners back. And they are working. But I'll tell you what I'm really proud of now. About five months ago -- it took a while to get all the statutory approvals. We're putting our steel workers back to work at clips that nobody would believe, right?
U.S. Steel is opening up seven plants. Nucor is opening up a brand new $250 million plant in Florida. Just left Florida. Did anybody like that one? Wasn't that great?
Great state of Florida. That was another one. That was another one. They say, "The Republicans are going to have a hard time winning Florida." We won Florida quickly. They announced that one early in the night.
And we're doing better -- the nice part, we're doing better in all of these states than we did on election night -- much better... [Applause] despite only negative publicity, only negative stories from the fakers back there. [Audience Boos]
I go home, I see my wife. I said, "Honey, we're going to get the greatest -- I just did something so great today, you know. I just stopped missiles from being launched every two seconds in Korea."
"Baby, what I did with North Korea was great. I got along great with Chairman Kim. I got along great." That's a good thing, not a bad thing, by the way.
I got along. "And you know what? Baby, I got the hostages back. Didn't have to pay anything."
"And you know what, honey? They're not testing any more nuclear. They haven't had a test in nine months. And you know what else? They're not sending rockets over Japan and they're not sending missiles over Japan and they're not launching missiles anymore. They haven't launched one in nine months."
I said, "Oh, the media is going to treat me, finally, so good. So good. I mean, it's going to be so great, baby. I'm looking so forward to getting up tomorrow and reading those dying papers." [Laughter]
And what do I read? What do I read? So I left three months ago. What do I read? They've been working on this stuff for 75 years. Obama didn't do anything. In all fairness, other administrations did nothing.
They've been working on it for so many decades. What do I read? I left three months ago. "Donald Trump isn't moving fast enough." Would you believe? [Laughter]
I'm not moving fast enough. Oh boy, what a group. What a group. You know another one in Helsinki, I had a great meeting with Putin. We discussed everything. I had a great meeting. I had a great meeting. We got along really well.
By the way, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. That's a really good thing. Now, we're being hindered by the Russian hoax. It's a hoax, OK? I'll tell you what: Russia's very unhappy that Trump won, that I can tell you.
But I got along great with Putin. And everybody said, "Wow, that was great. That was great." A couple of hours later I started hearing these reports that, you know, they wanted me to walk up -- here's a podium, they wanted me to walk up and go like this. [Laughter]
They wanted me to go up and have a boxing match. I said, "Whatever happened to diplomacy?" And by the way, whatever happened to diplomacy? You know, I used to study -- not too much -- diplomacy. I said, "Whatever happened to getting everything you want?" Now, some you have to be rough, some you have to be nice. But whatever happened?
And let me tell you, if I did go up and start screaming, they would've said, "He was terrible. He was so rude. It was horrible. His performance was horrible." Whatever happened to fair press? Whatever happened to honest reporting? [Audience Boos]
So, we had a great meeting with Russia, we had a great meeting with Putin, although they just hammered, because they really thought I was soft. Soft? I mean, I was -- I was the one that let out 60 diplomats. I was the one that complained about the fact that Germany is paying billions of dollars for a ridiculous pipeline coming into Germany. They're paying billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia. I was the one that complained about it.
We had a bad conflict in the Middle East, which I hate, but we had a conflict, and a lot of people died and it was horrible. A lot of people died and I hate it. But we're going to win all the time, folks. We're going to win all the time.
But if I get along with Vladimir Putin, that's a good thing, folks, not a bad thing. Good -- a good thing.
Then -- then I met with NATO. Now, NATO -- in all fairness, 29 countries including us, NATO has been ripping us. We've been defending Europe and they're not paying their bills. So I went in and I said, "Folks, you got to pay up. You're delinquent." They'll be paying $200 billion. It took me one hour, but it was a rough hour.
The head of NATO, Secretary General Stoltenberg, said to the press -- they don't report it, they only make up stories. They only make up.
So what happened, he said, last year alone, because of what I did the previous year, we took in $44 billion more. You have to understand, this is money to guard against Russia. I wouldn't say Putin's thrilled about that. Not thrilled. 44. Now, they will be taking in over a period -- short period of years $200 billion, $200 billion.
Are you OK? Is it OK? Are they OK? You all right? We got to stick with our people that wait here for hours and hours, right? Come on, are you OK, darling? Good. She looks good. We got to stick with those people. Anybody in this front row, they've been here for many hours. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Thank you. And come back. If you want, come back after you feel a little bit better. You come back, darling, OK? Come back, all right? You come back. Make sure she gets back. We'll bring her up here. Beautiful. Thank you.
So I raised 44 billion last year. And, you know -- I don't know if you know, NATO funding was going down. And they said, our other presidents -- I won't be particular. Of course, you're only dealing with, like, let's say three people. We won't go back any further than that -- they would come, they would make a speech, they'd say, "Could you please pay a little more money? Thank you very much. Well, good luck, everybody." They'd leave; nobody would pay. [Laughter]
The next one would come, "You know NATO, they don't pay any money. We're defending Europe. They don't pay any money. Could you please pay a little bit more money? Thank you very much, everybody. It's been wonderful meeting you. Thank you very much, Luxembourg. Thank you very much." They don't pay.
The next one comes, same thing. And I came I said, "Fellas, you're delinquent, you got to pay. You got to pay." And one of the leaders said, Well, Mr. President, could I ask you a question? If we don't pay, what are you going to do about it?" I said, "Do you want protection or not? Do you want protection or not?"
So I said to my wife, "You know, I just raised, like, a couple of hundred billion dollars and it was like so easy. It was so easy." I said, "Honey, wait'll you see the press I get on this [Inaudible]. It's going to be great!"
And here's what the fake news said... [Audience Boos] Go on. They said, "Donald Trump, our president, was extremely rude to presidents and prime ministers" and in a couple of cases dictators, but that's all right. But "Donald Trump was very rude."
They don't talk about the money I raised. I was rude. And I wasn't. Actually I have a better relationship with every one of them than any other president has had, every one. And they respect us again. They respect us again. So NATO is very well-funded. These countries are starting to pay up. You got to pay up, folks. You got to pay up.
You know, we went through the entire room and the last gentlemen, a prime minister, said, "You know, we're all saying how wonderful everything is, but I don't think the president of the United States is happy. Nobody's talking about that." And he looked at me and said, "President," this before they made the commitment, he said, "President, are you happy?" To me.
I said, "No. Thank you for bringing it up." This is after they went through 28 people. I said "Thank you very much for bringing it up." And this gentleman -- and maybe they'll find a transcript -- he said, "We got to make the president happy." I said "The only way I'm going to be happy is you got to pay your bills, folks. You got to pay your bills."
Because the United States is not going to continue to spend our money, our sweat, our tears, our blood on people that aren't. And you know, I don't know if you know it, and I said to them as a room, I said, "Look, I'm all for NATO. One thing I know is that NATO, which protects Europe, is better for Europe than it is for the United States. We're way far away."
You know, you'll listen to some of the generals, "Sir, they are an ally. We must protect them." And they're a long way away. I'm all for NATO. You know why? Because now the money is pouring in. And they said I treated them badly and I didn't. I have such a great relationship. So I'm very proud of it.
So when I woke up, I said, "This is going to be great. Finally, finally I'm going to get great press. This is going to be great." And I got hammered by even NATO.
So NATO's in great shape. Our country's in great shape. We're so strong again, so strong. We are so strong. [Audience Chants USA] Shall I give you one more of those crazy stories? This was on the trip. So one more?
So, I have great respect for the U.K., United Kingdom. Great respect. People call it Britain. They call it Great Britain. They call it -- they used to call it England, different parts. But the U.K., great respect. And I was asked to have tea with the queen, who is incredible, by the way. Incredible.
So I was hearing -- I had landed and I'm on the grounds and I'm waiting with the king's and with the queen's guards. Wonderful people. I'm waiting. So I was about 15 minutes early and I'm waiting with my wife. And that's fine. Hey, it's the queen right? We can wait. But I'm a little early.
So I then go up and meet the queen and she is fantastic. We then go up and we have tea. And I didn't know this, it was supposed to last for 15 minutes, but it lasted for, like, an hour because we got along. We got along.
And she liked our first lady and our first lady liked her. And I won't talk about conversation because you're not supposed to. Unless you want to hear. No, I'm only kidding.
But we got along fantastically well and the time went by. You know, like, sometimes if you like somebody you get along, good chemistry, the time goes by. So we were there for about an hour.
So here's the story. I got there -- remember, I got there early and the queen's guards waited with me. Waited. In fact, we took a helicopter. See all these Secret Service guys? They're not late. They're not -- they're not, like, late. They don't believe in being late. They believe -- they're incredible. They believe in being early, not late.
One of them said to me, "Sir, we weren't late." So here was the story by the fake news, "The president was 15 minutes late for the queen." Wrong. [Audience Boos] And then here's the rest of the story. No, here's the rest. Here's the rest of the story.
So, they said I was late, when I was actually early, number one. Number two, I guess the meeting was scheduled for 15 minutes and it lasted for almost an hour. "The president overstayed."
So, I was late and I overstayed. And honestly folks it was such a beautiful, beautiful visit and afternoon. But they can make anything bad because they are the fake, fake, disgusting news. [Audience Boos]
All right, let's get back to some boring subjects like Bob Casey. [Laughter] So Bob Casey -- boy, isn't that boring after these wonderful -- and I'm now going to talk about Bob Casey, I'll start falling asleep. Don't fall asleep as we talk about Sleeping Bob. [Laughter]
Sleeping Bob, hah. That's it, Sleeping Bob. That's it. That's it. Sleeping Bob. So Bob Casey -- Bob Casey is for open borders. [Audience Boos] In other words -- look, folks -- hey, folks, I went to school in Pennsylvania. I went to a great school in Philadelphia. Great. The best. I went to the best school. And you wouldn't believe it, but I was a very good student. These people would never tell you that.
But, you know, I know the people of Pennsylvania very well. And they are not for super-liberal Democrats. They're just not. Unless maybe the world has changed.
But Bob Casey wants open borders, which means crime. It means crime. You see this. He wants people to pour in, and if they pour in by the millions, that's, I guess, OK. I don't get it. [Audience Calls Out "Lou"] Lou, Lou, yeah. [Audience Chants Build That Wall]
Building. We're building it. We're building it. We're building it. So, we've started the wall, $1.6 billion. We're fixing walls all over the border. And we're going to start to get very nasty over the wall.
You know, the Democrats -- anything I want -- and it's not even the Republicans. I don't know if they care about the -- if they care about me. They're very concerned.
Anything I want, they want to oppose. You know, I just figured out how to do the wall: I'll say I don't want to build the wall and they'll insist on building it. I just figured that out right now. So Bob Casey doesn't mind MS-13 coming in. [Audience Boos]
These are the slicers. They slice people up and they're -- and remember I called them animal and Nancy Pelosi scolded me, "How dare he call another human being an animal?" They're animals.
Bob Casey wants to fire the incredible men and women of ICE. He wants to abolish ICE, because he's weak. [Audience Boos] And let me just tell you something. These people are so tough. And you need tough, because the only thing that MS-13 and these gangs that we're throwing the hell out of here at record numbers -- we're doing a good job.
But the only thing that these gangs understand is tough. They don't understand a nice person like the gentleman in the second row. He's a nice man. I can see. Sir, you wouldn't last two minutes talking to ICE. I hate to say it. His wife knows I'm telling the truth. [Laughter]
We need strong people. I have a sheriff was a great friend of mine. And he said -- and he's had a problem with the MS-13 people. He said to me, "You know something, President, I really don't mind ICE comes in and does the job. I really don't want" -- you know, this is tough stuff.
They want to get rid of these incredible warriors. They're warriors. We're fighting a war and we're fighting a war on drugs. They're bringing in drugs. They're bringing in lots of bad people. We're getting the hell -- we're stopping it.
So we're going to be taking some very tough actions. Going to be taking some tough actions.
I don't know if it's before the election or after the election. You know, a lot of the Republicans say -- and they're good. They're good. We need more Republicans. But they're friends of mine.
They say, "President, you know?" And some of them are really tough guys. And they said, "Sir, we're better off if we wait till after." I say, "It's better before. Let's do it before." "Sir, we're better off." You know who thinks it should be before? Rush Limbaugh thinks it should be before... [Applause] before the election. You know who else? Sean Hannity. A lot of them. A lot of them.
Great people. You know, a lot of people think -- but a lot of great Republicans, well-meaning. I don't mean like they're well-meaning. They say, "Look, we have the best economy ever. We're doing great. Maybe we don't want to complicate it."
And I understand it. I'm a little torn myself. I would personally prefer before, but whether it's before or after, we're either getting it or we're closing down government. We need border security. We need border security.
We got to have border security. We got to get rid of visa -- how about that? -- visa, visa lottery. You know what a lottery is? You pick it out of a hat.
Now, do you think that these countries, many of whom get aid from us and then they send -- remember when I did, I hate to say it, coming down the escalator, the beautiful first lady in the white dress coming down that escalator, that big, big beautiful day?
When everybody said, "Oh, he's just doing this for fun. He doesn't really mean it." Man, if I don't mean it, I hope you're telling me soon, because it's a lot of work. [Laughter]
But coming down the escalator, and you remember what I said, "They're sending." Do you remember that? "They're sending."
And I mentioned words -- I won't even mention them tonight because there's a lot of young people here, but I mentioned words and everybody thought it was wonderful. But then about two days later they said, "Did he say this? Did he say that?"
Guess what? What I said is peanuts compared to what turns out to be the truth. It's peanuts. So -- so, we're going to have not lottery where you pick it out. "Ladies and gentlemen, our first lottery winner." You know, they think we're playing, like, a game show. [Laughter]
"Our first lottery winner. Let's see he has seven convictions for death. He's killed nine people. And we're getting him the hell out of our country and giving them to the stupid politicians that have been running the United States for many years. And we're going to send him up there because he just won the lottery. Congratulations. Congratulations. Yeah, that's a beauty."
Then you have chain migration. Chain migration. [Audience Boos]
And this was a Schumer deal. Schumer wanted this. Schumer. You have chain migration. You know what that is? A guy comes in -- stone-cold killer in many cases. A guy comes in, and then you have to bring his aunt, his uncle, his father, his grandfather, his grandparents, his third niece by a different marriage.
So, this bad guy that ran over and killed eight people on the West Side Highway in New York City -- a place I know very well -- driving like 80 miles an hour in a 20-mile zone. And then he said, "Hey, look, there's people. Nice people. They're relaxing. Some are jogging. Beautiful park along the Hudson River." He decides to kill them. So he makes a right turn. He killed eight and many are just decapitated. They lost arms. They lost limbs. They lost so much. They lost their life. But they lost so much.
You know, nobody ever talks about this seriously injured people. They always talk about the people that died. In some cases, those are the lucky ones. What happens with some of these people how badly injured they are, their lives are so badly destroyed.
And this animal killed eight and he wounded eight or nine. Some are still in the hospital; that was a year and a half ago. And he came in through chain, and he has 22 relatives here that came in because he was here. He has his uncle and his aunt and he has his grandfather.
So, we have to change this and we're going to change it. And here's the last: We have to change -- we have to change a thing called catch and release. This is like for stupid people, catch and release.
Somebody walks across the border, they put their foot on there, not even two feet, just one foot. And you might as well, "Welcome to the United States, we'll never get you out of here," OK?
Remember when I said about a month ago I said, "No, I don't want to" -- they want me to hire thousands of judges, thousands -- can you imagine the corruption that would take place, you're hiring thousands? You go into a barber shop, "Anybody want to be a judge? We need judges." [Laughter]
They want me to hire thousands. I said, "We don't need judges. We need Border Patrol. We need Border Patrol."
If you have a house and somebody goes to sleep on your lawn, you say, "Sorry, folks, get out of here." If you call the police they're going to remove -- they're going to take -- it's your lawn. This is our country. This is our country. Get the hell out.
And we're doing really well, but we have really bad laws. You know, we're setting record numbers in terms of positive stuff, but we just have bad laws. So catch and release. You catch him, now you take his name and then you release him. And he's supposed to show up to a court hearing.
The problem is, there's thousands and thousands of people, we don't have enough judges, but hopefully the Justice Department will get moving on that. Hopefully. Come on, Justice Department, get us some judges over there, focus, focus.
So, they come back three or four years later but here's the problem: They never come back. They don't come back. Why the hell would they come back?
So, a very tiny percentage comes back. So, you catch a stone-cold criminal, you take his name, you see he's the criminal, you see he's bad in many cases. Catch and release. You catch him and you then release him. And he now goes into your wonderful towns. He now comes to the wonderful state of Pennsylvania. [Audience Boos]
Catch and release, we have to end it. So we have to end catch and release. We have to end our lottery system, and we have to end chain migration. And we have to build the wall and we're going to do it.
And Bob Casey is against every one of the things I just said. He wants the lottery system. He wants chain migration. By the way, if you ask him why, he can't -- he wants it because Schumer said to have it.
They think it's good politically. I'll tell you what, I think it's horrible politically. What do I know? But I did become president in like a year and a half.
So, we need Republicans. We need Lou Barletta. He is tough. We need Lou Barletta. [Audience Calls Out "Lou"] We do. He is tough. They're liking you, Lou. They're liking you. I could have told you that a long time ago.
All you have to do is meet him. All you have to do is see him. I hear that Bob Casey is afraid to debate Lou Barletta. He doesn't want to debate. I hear he's afraid to debate. Is that true? I hear he's afraid to debate.
Oh, I want to watch that debate. I want to be -- is the president of the United States allowed to come into the debate forum, where you probably have 25 people watching, and is he allowed to sit in the front row watching Lou Barletta destroy in the debate Bob Casey?
Am I allowed to that? Because if I am, I'll be there. I'll be there. That will be great entertainment. That'll be great entertainment. I've seen this one before. He's tough. So, I want to thank Republican leadership because America is winning again. Lou said it before, but last week we announced that the U.S. economy grew at 4.1 percent last quarter. Nobody thought that was possible.
And if the Democrats got in, that number would be 1.2, it could even turn negative. It was going to go down. We were set to have -- because of the regulations. It was choking. We were being choked. Don't forget, I approved the Keystone XL pipeline and I approved the Dakota Access pipeline, 48,000 jobs in, like, my first few hours in office.
Since the election, we've added a number that nobody would have believed, and that I would have never said on the campaign trail -- I wouldn't have said it, because they would have done a big number on me -- 3.7 million new jobs, including close to 400,000 jobs in the manufacturing world.
Remember? Remember? Remember when they said manufacturing is dead? Oh, it is? Well, who's going make things? I mean, tell me. "Manufacturing is dead," they said. We've added 400,000 incredible jobs.
And you've heard this but I'm going to say it over and over because I'm really proud of it: Remember I said, "What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose?" African-Americans and so many others, I said, "What do you have to lose? You have high crime rates. You have horrible education. You have this" -- I went through a list of 10, that's what happened. And I looked and I said, "You've been totally giving your votes to Democrats. They've let you down." I said, "What the hell do you have to lose?"
And you know what? This new election and certainly the next one, where we're going to have it just "Keep America Great" -- I tell you, I love those hats, but they're going to be, you know, "Make America Great Again" will morph into "Keep America Great," exclamation point.
But don't lose those hats. They'll be very valuable someday. Make America Great Again, maybe the greatest slogan ever, right? Ronald Reagan had one, "Let's Make America Great." I like it, but ours is better. I like ours better. So, what happened is the African-American unemployment rate has reached the lowest level in the history of our country.
Honestly, think of that number. I really think that's hard for the Democrats to beat. I mean, think of that statement: I got the lowest number for you in the history of our country. How do you top that?
Let's say I'm running against Pocahontas or... [Laughter] or crazy Bernie. I tell you, I got to hand it to Bernie. I saw him up there the other day, that hair is getting whiter and whiter, and he's getting crazier and crazier. And I saw him, "We'll stop Donald Trump. We'll stop him."
And I looked at my wife, I said, "You know what? You got to hand it to that guy. Man, that guy, he doesn't quit." And that's OK. Crazy Bernie, he is one crazy dude. [Laughter]
So, I don't know who we're going to run against. I don't know. But when Bernie tells how wonderful things are, think of it, he wants to raise your taxes, he wants to create massive amounts of crime, he wants to open your borders. Think of it. Just think of it.
When he goes out, and I say one thing: "African-American, Hispanic, Asian, you have the lowest level of unemployment in the history of our country," how does somebody fight that, right? How does somebody fight it, right? How do you fight that?
Don't forget, when I was running the last time against Crooked Hillary, what happened? What happened? I had nothing like that. I said I was going to do that, but you had to take my word for it.
One of these guys said recently, "Whether you like him or not, he's actually fulfilled more promises than he made," and I have. And I have. And I had Obamacare done except one guy at 2 o'clock in the morning went in and said... [Audience Boos] he went thumbs down, even though he campaigned for years repeal and replace all right.
But we've done a number on Obamacare. We're coming out with tremendous health care plans. We've gotten rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing probably in our country.
Gone, gone, no individual mandate, where you have the privilege to pay a fortune as a penalty in order not to pay a fortune for bad health care. Think of that. Is that a good thing? I don't think so.
We got rid of it. It's gone. You know how many people have come up to me and said, "Thank you very much for getting rid of the individual mandate"? Sounds so nice. Isn't it a beautiful term?
The individual mandate is wonderful. See, I'm acting presidential now. The individual mandate. [Laughter] The individual mandate is a disaster; it sounds good. Like the Affordable Care Act was not affordable.
Remember when Bill Clinton got up, he said, "The problem with the Affordable Care Act is that it's not affordable"? And then you didn't hear from him for two weeks because he got the hell knocked out of him by Crooked Hillary.
For two weeks he went dead silent. They wouldn't let him out of the house. The women's unemployment rate -- I'm sorry, women, damn it -- is the lowest in only 65 years, not history. Sorry. But it'll be low soon. It'll be -- so it's 65 years, 65 years. But I would almost bet within two weeks or the next time this incredible statistical group is relaxed and released, I would say that probably the women will be historic also, right? Right? I think so.
But it's 65 years. I'm doing my best. 52 percent. Oh, the women liked me, you know. They liked me. They liked me. I keep hearing it, but look at all those signs, the pink signs with the women. Look at that. Look at that. The women have been great. And I think they are incredible. They have a harder job than all of us, fellows, let me tell you. The women are great.
And we did great with the women. In fact, I remember, again, on election night they said, "How the hell did this happen?" Remember, they were giving you phony numbers on that, too. The veterans unemployment rate has reached the lowest level in 18 years and that's going to go up.
More than 3.5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. More than 4 million Americans are going to receive job training under our new workforce initiative.
Manufacturing, consumer and business confidence has reached the highest level in the history of our country. I'd say that's pretty good. Confidence is a good thing. Having confidence -- what do you think, having confidence is good, right?
If you have confidence and you know what you're doing, you can't lose. That's a great stat, think of it, essentially business the most confident in our country. It's great.
The United States is now a net natural gas exporter for the first time in more than 60 years. And Pennsylvania workers are leading the way. You're leading the way. I don't know if you even know that. Right?
Now that we have the best economy in the history of our country, this is the time to straighten out the worst trade deals ever made by any country on Earth at any time. [Audience Chants USA]
For generations, Pennsylvania steel and Pennsylvania coal made this state the center of the industrial world. The workers of Scranton and Bethlehem and Allentown and Wilkes-Barre were the backbone of American might. They really were the backbone of our country, the backbone of American strength and might. But the loyalty of our workers was repaid with betrayal. You were betrayed by our politicians. You were betrayed by the people that ran our country. But you're not betrayed anymore.
Pennsylvania lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and China joined the WTO. Right now, China is not too happy with me. But I have great respect for President Xi and I have great respect for China. It's not their fault that our leaders were stupid.
For decades, our politicians ran for office pledging to crack down on unfair trade, but they never did it. But once elected, they did absolutely nothing, and our workers and our country got ripped off like no country ever before in the history of the world. We got ripped off. It was a massive, massive transfer of wealth to other countries.
The politicians just watched as other countries stole our jobs, plundered our wealth and looted the crown jewels of the American economy.
But I am not another politician. I keep my promises to the people. I didn't need this. I didn't need this. I didn't need it. I had a very nice life. I didn't need to be -- you know, I used to get, actually, good press. I didn't need this. But I love it.
I love it because we're doing things that are historic. There has never been -- and even these people back here, these horrible horrendous people... [Laughter]
Even these people back there said, "Look at this. It looks like the Academy Awards there's so many. You ever see this? Is this the Academy Awards you're doing?"
Even these people, they say probably in the history of this country, maybe in the history of the world, there has never been anything like what happened in November of '16. Probably not. Probably never happened. Probably never happened. I really believe there's never been.
I remember watching one, and we were starting to do really well. In that last two weeks I had crowds like this everywhere, we had thousands of people outside they couldn't get in. I said, "So why are we going to lose?" Hillary would come in, she'd have 350 people. [Laughter]
She'd bring in Beyonce, and then Jay-Z would get up and use language that was so bad, if I ever used that language I'd be run out of the country. They say "Trump's language is very tough." Did you ever hear Jay-Z?
And she'd bring in Bruce Springsteen and then draw crowds... [Audience Boos] They were drawing crowds smaller than my crowds. And I said, "Why are we going to lose?" And you know what? We didn't.
But what happened was interesting. Because they started off by saying, "We haven't seen anything like this since Ronald Reagan." I like Ronald Reagan. And then it got bigger and bigger and wilder and wilder, and then we won by a lot. Don't forget it was 306 to 223; that's a lot. Remember?
"There is no way" -- according to fake news CNN, "There is no way for Trump to get to 270" -- you got to get to 270 -- "there is no path" -- remember the expression, ladies and gentlemen? -- "There is no path for Donald Trump to get to 270." No, there wasn't, but 306 was no problem. So, after years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country.
In the numbers that were just released -- the reporters didn't cover this one; to me it was maybe more important than the 4.1, because we're going to be doing a lot better than 4.1 as things go -- for the first time maybe ever, the trade deficit just fell -- think of that -- by, for the quarter, $52 billion. Nobody reports it.
Why don't you report that? Just fell by $52 billion. And because of our economic planning and our charging taxes, or tariffs, to all of the dumpers of steel all over our country, America's steel mills are roaring again. Our country is being respected again, because we are finally putting America first.
We've eliminated a record number of job-crushing regulations. I withdrew the United States from the unfair and very, very expensive for our country Paris Climate Accord. So unfair. [Audience Boos] That was another great rip-off. Republicans just passed the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.
And the Democrats want to lift them way up. Remember that, when you go to vote, they want to end your tax cuts and they want to lift it up so they can waste your money on a lot of nonsense. [Audience Boos]
And very importantly, we saved our family farms and our small businesses from the estate tax, also known as the death tax. No longer the death tax. No longer will they pay the estate tax, our family farmers.
The individual mandate's gone, the penalty is gone. Through associate health plans -- you know that -- the association health plans are giving us and allowing Americans to join forces to buy much better health care for a fraction of the cost. And you can go cross state lines and negotiate with everybody you want to negotiate with.
We've invested a record $700 billion in our military and $716 billion next year. We're rebuilding our military with the finest planes, the finest missiles, the finest ships anywhere in the world. We had to do it. We had to do it.
And they're all made in the USA, folks. It's called jobs, too. In that case, much less important, because there's nothing so important as protection on our military. But in this case the only time it's secondarily, it's called jobs, because all of this equipment and all of these brilliant planes -- and everybody else they want to buy, all of them. We have a backlog. We make the greatest military equipment in the world. We make the greatest jets. We make the greatest ships. We make the greatest missiles. We have the anti-missile missiles that shoot down missiles many, many miles away in the sky, like a needle in a haystack. They shoot them down, hard to believe.
And we're surrounding our country with them, by the way, if you don't mind. Remember what other countries said? "We don't want you to put defensive mishes and missiles in your country." You don't want us to put -- explain that to me, please. Remember? They used to get angry when we would put defensive missiles, anti-missile missiles in our country. And so we wouldn't do it.
No thanks. We'll put them in, if you don't mind. And I've directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating a sixth branch of the United States armed forces called the Space Force. Very important.
We just passed the landmark V.A. accountability law. Now if a bad government worker mistreats or neglects or steals, does anything bad to our great veterans, we turn to them and we say, "You're fired, get the hell out of here." Right?
Got to do it. Got to do it. Maybe most importantly -- that was 40 years they tried to get accountability. But even more, I wanted Veterans Choice, where if a veteran isn't properly served, if they have to wait three, four or five weeks -- can you imagine yourselves, the doctor says, "Oh, that's OK. Come back in 22 days"? People that were not ill end up being terminally ill because they can't see a doctor.
So we passed -- they've been trying to pass it for 40 years, we just passed -- I signed it a month ago, Veterans Choice, where a veteran -- our great, great veterans, if they have to wait for a long period, they go outside, they go to a private doctor and we pay the bill. Right?
I withdrew the United States from the horrible and very expensive -- and a deal that didn't work -- the Iran nuclear deal. And I hope everything's going to be fine with us and Iran. But I will tell you, they are a much different country than they were four months ago. I also recognized the capital of Israel, and five months later we opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
Instead of apologizing for America, we are standing up, and we love our country, and we're saying we have a great country. We don't apologize anymore. We're standing up for the heroes who defend America. And we're proudly standing up for our national anthem. [Audience Chants USA]
With every promise we keep, every record we break, and every factory we open, we are restoring American strength and we are restoring American pride. But to continue this incredible movement, we must elect more Republicans so we can get the votes that we need to pass these incredible programs.
And most importantly, get your friends, get your neighbors, and get out and vote for an incredible champion, an incredible winner, Lou Barletta. [Audience calls out "Lou"]
Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We're returning power to where it belongs, to the American people. This is the state where our founding fathers declared our independence, signed our Constitution and defended our God-given rights.
Proud Pennsylvania workers mined the coal, worked the railroads and forged the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of our world. And now it's more powerful and richer than ever before, and it's only going to get better.
From Valley Forge to Gettysburg to Normandy, Pennsylvania patriots gave their sweat, their blood and their very lives to protect our families, our freedom and our great American flag. We stand on the shoulders of these American patriots who knew how to work, knew how to fight and knew how to win. They knew how to win.
With your help, your voice and your vote, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning. We are going to win so much perhaps some of you, but not all, will get tired of winning. Anybody going to get tired of winning? We will never give up, we will never give in, we will never back down, and we will never stop fighting for this land that we love.
Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Vote for Lou. Thank you. Vote for Lou. [Applause]
Thank you, Melania, America loves our First Lady, thank you. I am thrilled to be back in the great state of Ohio right here with the incredible men and women of Youngstown. What an amazing few days it's been. On Saturday, I was in Virginia with thousands of brave men and women of the United States military.
Do we love the United States military? We commissioned the newest, largest, and most advanced aircraft carrier in the history of our nation, the USS Gerald R. Ford into the great American fleet. [Applause] Then yesterday, I was in West Virginia with almost 50,000 of our most impressive young Americans.
They are young men who learned to cherish words like duty, honor, God, and country, the Boy Scouts. Then only a few hours ago the senate approved a vote to begin debating the repealing and replacing the Obamacare disaster. [Applause, Cheers] Finally. You think that's easy? That's not easy.
We're now one step closer to liberating our citizens from this Obamacare nightmare, and delivering great health care for the American people. We're gonna do that too. And now tonight I'm back in the center of the American heartland, far away from the Washington swamp to spend time with thousands of true American patriots. [Audience chants Drain the Swamp] We have spent the entire week celebrating with the hard-working men and women who are helping us make America great again.
I'm here this evening to cut through the fake news filter and to speak straight to the American people. fake news. fake, fake, fake news..
Boy oh boy, people. Is there any place that's more fun, more exciting and safer than a Trump rally?
Where the hell did he come from? This has been a difficult week for the media because I forced them to travel with us all around the country and spend time with tens of thousands of proud Americans who believe in defending our values, our culture, our borders, our civilization, and our great American way of life. [Applause], Everyone in this arena is united by their love, and you know that. Do we know that. Everyone.
United by their love for this country and their loyalty to one another, their loyalty to its people. [Applause] And we want people to come into our country who can love us and cherish us and be proud of America and the American flag. [Applause] We believe that schools should teach our children to have pride in our history and respect for that great American flag. We all believe in the rule of law, and we support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.
Thank you. Thank you for being here. [cheers. We celebrate our military and believe the American armed forces are the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world, and by the way, they're getting a lot greater fast.
A lot greater. You saw our budget. we're ordering billions and billions of dollars of new ships and new planes and equipment for our great soldiers. We are building it up. There's rarely been a time where we needed the protection of our incredible military more than right now, right here, and that's what we're going to do.
We believe in freedom, self-government, and individual rights. We cherish and defend -- thank you, it looks like it's in very good shape -- our Second Amendment. congratulations. [Applause] Yes, our Second Amendment is very, very sound again.
that would have been gonzo. It would have been gone, but i never had a doubt. We support the constitution of the United States and believe that judges should interpret the constitution as written and not make up new meaning for what they read. And finally, we believe that family and faith, not government and bureaucracy, are the foundation of our society.
You've heard me say it before on the campaign trail and I'll say it again tonight. In America, we don't worship government. We worship God. [Applause].
Tonight, we're going to set aside the cynics and the critics because we know exactly why they are so angry and so bitter. Day by day, week by week we are restoring our government's allegiance to its people, to its citizens, to the people that we all love. We are keeping our promises to the people, and yes, we are putting finally, finally, finally we are putting America first. [Applause, Audience chants USA].
After years and years of sending our jobs and our wealth to other countries, we are finally standing up for our workers and for our companies. [Applause] After spending billions of dollars defending other nations' borders, we are finally defending our borders. [Applause, Audience chants USA]. Don't even think about it, we will build the wall.
Don't even think about it. I watched the media as they say, well, he just had some fun during the campaign on the wall. That wasn't fun, folks. We're building that wall, and walls do work and we're going to have great people come into our country, but we're not gonna to put ourselves through the problems that we've had for so many years. [Applause]
After decades of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally going to rebuild our nation. [Audience boos]. They're pointing to a protester. Honestly, if you don't point, nobody's even going to know he's here. Weak voice, weak voice, don't worry. [Audience chants USA]. Boy, he's a young one.
he's going back home to mommy. Oh, is he in trouble. He's in trouble. He's in trouble.
And I'll bet his mommy voted for us, right? [Applause] By the way, so this morning I'm watching Fox News [crowd cheers] And they had some people on, and these were democrats that voted for trump. And they had this on. And so far if anything, they've gotten even more committed. But they had a man on this morning -- they had a man on this morning who was a Democrat his whole life.
He voted as a democrat, but he voted for -- I say us, I don't say me. He voted for us in the last election 2016. [Applause] And they said to him, so if the election were held now again, what would you do? And he effectively said, man, would I vote for Trump again, even faster. So his name is Gino de Fabio.
where is Gino? Gino, get over here, Gino. Whoa. Gino de Fabio!.
Anybody who knows me, friends of mine, people who love me it's worse for them, they know how it's been since President Trump started running for the election. How much I supported this guy, how much I love this guy, this guy's got something, he's the real deal. Everybody else came and said "we're gonna fight for you," this is Youngstown, Mr. President, but this is also the Steel Valley.
Every one of these people love you, Sir. And I don't want to sound silly or anything, but i thought what would I say to the President if I ever got to meet him, which this is an honest to God over the top moment for me. I thought you know I'm just going to tell him something. And sir, like I said, thank you for Justice Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.
Right? That started it all. And then I apologize, I said Mr. President, thank you for Melania. Could we have a more outstanding First Lady? I'm probably going to be in trouble with my wife, but God bless that woman.
And then last thing I said and I don't think he thought I was going to take this much time but anybody that knows me, this is gonna happen, I said thank you sir for keeping the promises you made. To these 12,000 people and to the country. In my recommendation sir, look what you could do in the bastion of the Democratic party. I don't think there's anyone except Cuyahoga County who is more Democratic than us.
Look who you could draw. I go back to Washington, I would tell the Republicans and the Democrats, "Look. I am going to go do my rallies. You got the agenda. Those people are voting for me and mine. Do what you want. Pass my agenda or we're going out on the road." Thank you sir. An absolute honor. Thank you sir.
Thank you, Gino. What a man. I watched him this morning, I said, we got to find this guy, he's just a great person. Always a Democrat, now it's gone.
I'll tell you what, I rode through your beautiful roads coming up from the airport, and I was looking at some of those big once incredible job-producing factories, and my wife, Melania, said what happened? I said, those jobs have left Ohio. They're all coming back. They're all coming back. [Applause]. Don't move.
Don't sell your house. Don't sell your house. Remember, i got a lot of credit. This is hard to believe but the press gave me a lot of credit because a number of years ago I said this is the time to buy a house during one of my speeches.
I said, go out and buy, and they did this big story, Trump predicted. Let me tell you folks in Ohio and in this area, don't sell your house. Don't sell your house. Do not sell it.
We're going to get those values up. We're going to get those jobs coming back, and we're going to fill up those factories or rip them down and build brand new ones. It's going to happen. [Applause] We're gonna have it so that Americans can once again speak the magnificent words of Alexander Hamilton, "here the people govern." Political correctness for me is easy.
Sometimes they say he doesn't act Presidential. And I say, hey look, great schools, smart guy, it's so easy to act presidential but that's not gonna to get it done. In fact, I said it's much easier, by the way, to act presidential than what we're doing here tonight, believe me. And I said -- and I said with the exception of the late great Abraham Lincoln, i can be more presidential than any President that's ever held this office.
That I can tell you. It's real easy. [Applause] But sadly, we have to move a little faster than that. We will never be beholden to the lobbyists or the special interests.
We will never be silenced by the media. I want to protect America, and i want to protect the citizens of America. Your hopes are my hopes. Your dreams are my dreams.
I've had a great successful career. I've built a great, great business. This is the only thing that matters. This is the only thing that matters.
There is nothing else. Your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day. Here is just a small sample of what we have accomplished in just our first six months in office. And I'll say this and they always like to say, well, I don't know.
But I think that with few exceptions no president has done anywhere near what we've done in his first six months. Not even close. But they don't let you know. They don't want to write about it.
That unemployment last month hit a 16-year low. Since my election, we've added much more than 1 million jobs. Think of that. And remember I came in and some people said, don't say that.
I'd say, "what do you have to lose?" I talked about the inner city, and I talked about the crime and the problems and the lack of education, and I talked to my African-American friends and I said, vote for me, what the hell do you have to lose? Do you remember that? The Hispanic, the African-American, the inner cities. So now it just came out, African-Americans and teenagers are enjoying their lowest unemployment since just after the turn of the millennium. [Applause] That's pretty good, right? we've eliminated burdensome regulations at record speed and many, many more are coming off. And boy, have we put those coal miners and coal back on the map. You've seen that, haven't you? And all other forms of energy.
We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve. We have signed new legislation to hold federal workers accountable for the care they provide to our great, great veterans. Veterans Accountability Act, they've been trying to get that done for many, many, many years, even decades. And you understand why it was tough, but we got it done.
In fact, our secretary is with us tonight, David Shulkin, and we have some just incredible people here tonight, some of whom you've already met. But the job they're doing for the vets, having to do with choice, having to do with doctors, having to do with not having to wait online for days and days and days and getting sicker and sicker and sicker, where you could be taken care of immediately. Now you go out and you see a doctor. To protect American jobs and workers, I withdrew the united states from both the Trans-Pacific Partnership potential disaster and the job-killing Paris Climate Accord.
Believe me. And if we don't negotiate a great deal with Mexico and Canada, we will terminate NAFTA and we'll start all over again. You remember when I was in Youngstown, I said we will either renegotiate NAFTA or we'll terminate it. So let's see what happens, but we're right now negotiating with the heads of Mexico, a good man, the President, and the Prime Minister of Canada, a good man.
Let's see what happens. But we will no longer be the foolish people. We will no longer be the stupid people that get taken care of so badly by our politicians because they don't know what they're doing. [Applause] We will always work with our friends and partners, but we will never again sacrifice Ohio jobs or jobs from any state in our union to enrich other countries which has been what is happening to this country. [Audience chants USA]
And by the way, while we're on it, the Iran deal which may be the single worst deal I've ever seen drawn by anybody, if that deal doesn't conform to what it's supposed to conform to, there's going to be big, big problems for them. That I can tell you. You're going to see that. Believe me.
You would have thought when that deal was made by Secretary Kerry, maybe the worst negotiator I've ever seen, you would have thought that Iran would have said, thank you, United States. We can't believe you gave us between $100 billion and $150 billion when they were ready to fail. We can't believe you gave us $1.7 billion in cash. You know what that looks like? You would have thought they would have said, "thank you, United States, we really love you very much." Instead, they've become emboldened.
That won't take place much longer. [Applause] The great president from the state of Ohio, William McKinley and you know William McKinley, does anybody know who the hell he is? Do you know who he is? William McKinley understood that when America protects our workers and our industries, we open up a higher and better destiny for our people. We don't protect our people. We don't protect.
Trade comes in, goods come in. I was with Harley-Davidson, a great company from Wisconsin. Who has a Harley-Davidson? A lot of you. [Applause] They came to the White House and they said to me, "yeah, it's tough going outside of the United States.
We're doing great in the United States but when we sell a motorcycle to certain countries, we have as much as a 100% tax to pay." And I said, "tell me, when they sell back to us, meaning reciprocal, so when they sell back to us, what tax do we charge them?" The answer is zero. [Booing] Those days are going to be over very soon. [Applause] Unfortunately, like everything else, there are so many restrictions on doing what's right for our country, there's so much red tape, but don't worry, we're getting through it. The red tape, you would think we could just do it.
Wouldn't you think you could say, "hey, you charge us 100%, we're going to charge you 100%?" Then either you'll get the money or you'll both drop it, right? We can't do that. We've got to go back to Congress, who other than health care today, has been made some very bad deals, okay? So we're going to start enriching our country. We're going to start bringing back our jobs, and we will be fools no longer, folks. We'll be fools no longer.
Every single President on Mt. Rushmore now here's what i do. I'd ask whether or not you think I will someday be on Mt. Rushmore, but, but here's the problem.
If I did it joking, totally joking, having fun, the fake news media will say, "he believes he should be on Mt. Rushmore." So I won't say it, okay? I won't say it. But every president -- they'll say it anyway tomorrow. "Trump thinks he should be on Mt. Rushmore."
Isn't that terrible? What a group. What a dishonest group of people, I'll tell you. [Applause] And you know the funny thing is that you would think they'd want to see our country be great again. You would really think so.
But they don't. Someday they'll explain it to me why. Every president on Mt. Rushmore believed in protecting American industry. We have to protect our industry. And now we are going to start, we are reclaiming our heritage as a manufacturing nation again. Bob Kraft, the owner of the New England patriots, I don't know if you like New England but they have a hell of a team. [Booing] That's okay.
But he came to the Oval Office and he brought a sheet with him that just came out. Manufacturing enthusiasm in the United States is at an all-time high. Isn't that great? To me that's so great. because we're going to bring back our jobs, bring back our wealth, and we are going to bring back our dreams, and we are going to bring back, once again our sovereignty as a nation.
As a nation. [Audience chants USA] Since I took office we have cut illegal immigration on our southern border by record numbers. 78%. [Audience chants Build the Wall] Record, record numbers.
And in fact, the ICE, folks I'll tell you what, and the border patrol police, they are phenomenal people. They're working with General Kelly. And just so you understand, we've already started fixing much of the good wall that's already there. We've already started fixing it. But we are breaking records.
And it was actually told to me the other day by somebody in Mexico that's very high up, said it's incredible because their southern border is getting very little traffic. Nobody is coming anymore because they know they can't get through our southern border. So they don't even come. [Applause] Never again will America surrender the security of our people, the safety of our communities or the sovereignty of our nation.
We are cracking down hard on the foreign criminal gangs that have brought illegal drugs, violence, horrible bloodshed to peaceful neighborhoods all across our country. We are throwing MS-13 the hell out of here so fast. You know, we're actually -- hard to believe that we're talking about our great country. We are actually liberating towns and cities.
We are liberating people are screaming from their windows, thank you, thank you to the border patrol and to General Kelly's great people that come in and grab the thugs and throw them the hell out. We are liberating our towns and we are liberating our cities. Can you believe we have to do that? [Audience chants Build the Wall] Earlier in year and immigration and customs enforcement conducted the largest single raid of transnational gangs in the history of our country. We are dismantling and destroying the bloodthirsty criminal gangs, and well, I will just tell you in, we're not doing it in a politically correct fashion.
We're doing it rough. Our guys are rougher than their guys. I asked one of our great generals, "how tough are our people? How tough are they?" He said, "Sir, you don't want to know about it." Then I saw one guy come out, a customs officer who is a monster. I said, "so general, you think i could take that guy in a fight?" He said, "Mr.
President, sir i don't even want to think about it." I said "you're right, actually." We have tough people. Our people are tougher than their people. Our people are tougher and stronger and meaner and smarter than the gangs. One by one we are finding the illegal gang members, drug dealers, thieves, robbers, criminals and killers.
And we are sending them the hell back home where they came from. And once they are gone, we will never let them back in. Believe me. The predators and criminal aliens who poison our communities with drugs and prey on innocent young people, these beautiful, beautiful, innocent young people will, will find no safe haven anywhere in our country.
And you've seen the stories about some of these animals. They don't want to use guns, because it's too fast and it's not painful enough. So they'll take a young, beautiful girl, 16, 15, and others and they slice them and dice them with a knife because they want them to go through excruciating pain before they die. And these are the animals that we've been protecting for so long.
Well, they're not being protected any longer, folks. And that is why my administration is launching a nationwide crackdown on sanctuary cities. American cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans, for people that look up to the law, for people that respect the law, not for criminals and gang members that we want the hell out of our country. [Applause] Sanctuary cities legislation has passed the house, along with Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was brutally killed by a five-time deported illegal immigrant.
We are asking the Senate to vote on sanctuary cities and Kate's Law legislation. We've got to get it passed. The Trump administration has the backs of our ICE Officers, our border patrol agents. And yes, our great police officers.
And we have their backs 100%. We are going to also protect them, like they protect us. This month in Chicago, there have been more than 2 homicide victims per day. What the hell is going on in Chicago? Better tell that Mayor to get tough, because it's not working what they're doing.
We are going to get criminals off our streets. And we are going to make America safe again. We also strongly believe that our borders must always be closed to terrorism and extremism. We don't want radical Islamic terrorists in our country.
We've seen the total devastation in Europe. And the attack from New York to Boston to San Bernardino. Exactly one year ago next month I came right here to Youngstown to deliver a major address on how my administration would protect our country from terrorism and radical Islamic terrorism. We only want to admit those into our country who share our values, who love our people and who always will love our people.
We don't want people coming into our country who have bad intentions even before they start. [Applause] We also believe that those seeking to immigrate into our country should be able to support themselves financially and should not be able to use welfare for themselves or the household for a period of at least five years. As we speak, we are working with two wonderful senators, Tom Cotton and David Purdue, to create a new immigration system for America. Instead of today's low-skill system, just a terrible system where anybody comes in.
People that have never worked, people that are criminals, anybody comes in. We want a merit-based system. One that protects workers our workers, our taxpayers, and one that protects our economy. We want it merit-based.
We want people that work really hard in their country and that are going to come into our country and work really, really hard. We don't want people that come into our country and immediately go on welfare and stay there for the rest of their lives. We're not going to do it. We are working every single day to move the legislation that serves the interests of the American people.
As we discussed earlier, at the very top of the list is health care reform. With Obamacare, the Washington obstructionists, meaning Democrats, made big promising to the American people. And every single promise they made turned out to be a lie. I can have your doctor.
You can have your plan. Do you remember? 28 times. You can have your doctor. You can have your plan. I know Democrats who heard that and they would have never have voted for it but they voted for it because they believed the lies of President Obama. For seven years every Republican running for office promised to repeal and replace in disastrous law. Now they must keep their promise. The Senate is working not only to repeal Obamacare but to deliver great health care for the American people.
Any senator who votes against repeal and replace is telling America that they are fine with the Obamacare nightmare, and I predict they'll have a lot of problems. In West Virginia, recent premiums have gone up 169% since Obamacare went into effect. In Alaska over 200%. And the deductibles have gone through the roof.
You'll never even get to use it. In Missouri, premiums have shot up 145% under Obamacare. In Pennsylvania the cost of Obamacare insurance has more than doubled, and the coverage has become horrific. It's time for Democrats to stop resisting.
That's their term. Resist. Resist. They have to do, finally, what's right for the American people. But probably we'll do it ourselves. Because today we won 51 to 50 and didn't get one Democrat vote. Think of that. [Applause] My administration is working every single day to heed and honor the will of the voters.
That includes working on one of the biggest tax cuts in American history. And actually if I get what I want it will be the single biggest tax cut in American history. We have the highest taxes anywhere in the world, and this will really bring them down to one of the lowest. And we really have no choice.
We will have growth. We will have everything that we've dreamed of having. It's time to let Americans keep more of their own money. It's time to bring new companies to our shores and to create a new era of growth, prosperity and wealth.
We want millions of Americans to be lifted from welfare to work and from dependence to independence. One of the ways we will put more Americans to work is by rebuilding our nation's crumbling infrastructure. That is why I have called on legislators to pass a bill that generates $1 trillion in new infrastructure investments. We're going to fix our roads our bridges our tunnels our airports.
We are going to fix all of the things that once made us great. And we are going to use American iron, American steel, American aluminum. We will buy American and will hire, finally, American. We want once again to have the best infrastructure.
The best schools, the best jobs, the best factories. And we want products that proudly carry the label "made in the USA." We want this country that we love so much, America, to be strong, proud and free. Which means America must also be united. Because when America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
Although I'll be totally honest with you even if it's not united we're unstoppable so don't worry. We're gonna to be unstoppable either way but it would be nice, wouldn't it? Our small differences are nothing compared to our common history, common values and common future. Wes hare one heart, one home and one glorious destiny. Now it is up to us to preserve the birth right of freedom and justice, the birth right of prosperity that our ancestors won for us with their sweat, with their sweat, with their blood, with their work, with their muscle, with their brain.
They won it for us and we're gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than it ever was before. It's time to look past the old divisions. They're tired, really tired, politicians. And the stale debates of the past, and to finally come together as one nation under god.
We have no choice. We cannot and never will back down. We will never, ever give up. We cannot fail. And if we remember what unites us, then I promise you we will not fail. We cannot fail. We will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again.
We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, God bless you, God bless the state of Ohio. Thank you everybody.
